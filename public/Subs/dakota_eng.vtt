1
00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:54.819
All right, already.
I'm doing it.

2
00:00:57.288 --> 00:00:59.023
So much for spring break.

3
00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:14.172
Keep it down.
I'm not in the mood.

4
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:34.391
I'm sorry, boy,

5
00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:37.628
but Mom has a feed delivery
coming tomorrow.

6
00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.136
Hamlet, you're going
to get me in a lot of trouble.

7
00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:50.774
Alex?

8
00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.911
Shh. Shh. Quiet. Quiet.

9
00:01:58.582 --> 00:01:59.951
Alex?

10
00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:05.656
What did I say?

11
00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:07.724
It was just...

12
00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.294
He looked so hungry.

13
00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.428
He's a pig, Alex.

14
00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:15.066
And one of us has to be firm
with him, and it's not gonna be me.

15
00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.871
You are filthy, girl.

16
00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:24.741
Still Daddy's little lady.

17
00:02:26.144 --> 00:02:28.813
Make sure you put his boots back
by my bed, okay?

18
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.848
They smell pretty bad.

19
00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:33.717
That's the best smell ever.

20
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.719
You are so weird, Mom.

21
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.961
You know, Dad always said
the land will provide.

22
00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:47.764
Yeah. But Dad probably
would've wanted to eat Hamlet.

23
00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:51.501
He would
not eat your show pig, hon.

24
00:02:52.703 --> 00:02:53.905
You finish up your chores

25
00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.407
and actually
take a shower today.

26
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.574
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:59.010
And don't tell Princess,

28
00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:01.112
but I'll bring home
cheeseburgers for dinner.

29
00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:35.046
What is it, girl?

30
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.843
You forget your helmet, Alex?

31
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.079
I didn't forget it.

32
00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:10.014
How is the egg business?

33
00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:11.648
Slow.

34
00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:15.286
Hey, Ethan.
What are you doing?

35
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.255
Killing zombies.

36
00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:22.860
You know, we are
trying to help your mom, right?

37
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:24.661
Our farm is not for sale.

38
00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:26.663
Your daddy was a war hero, Alex.

39
00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:28.966
People around here
take that stuff seriously.

40
00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:32.602
<i>Mike, meet me at Open Ridge</i>

41
00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:35.306
<i>right by Highway 54.</i>

42
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.341
Roger that.

43
00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:41.412
Gotta roll.
Tell your mom hey.

44
00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:43.747
Put on a helmet, will you?

45
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.962
Have a seat.

46
00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.103
Now this goes against
my better judgment, Sergeant.

47
00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.438
I'm told that dog may not
be safe for anyone anymore.

48
00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:08.840
Sir, I promised Clay...

49
00:05:08.973 --> 00:05:12.343
Clay Sanders
was a one-of-a-kind soldier.

50
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.879
But, this is not protocol
for our military dogs.

51
00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:17.115
Dakota is hardly a pet.

52
00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.021
Promise is a promise.

53
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.658
I just hope that you

54
00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:31.229
are up to date on your shots.

55
00:05:37.068 --> 00:05:39.337
You're being
reassigned to Camp Lejeune.

56
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.737
You have seven days of R&R

57
00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:42.840
once you step foot
back on American soil.

58
00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:47.078
Next time I see you
will be on North Carolina time.

59
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:48.212
Dismissed.

60
00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:52.116
Thank you.

61
00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:02.193
It took me two days
to catch her last time.

62
00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:08.966
Hey there, Dakota.

63
00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:13.037
Open the gate.

64
00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.439
Yes, sir.

65
00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:20.344
I guess I owe you a lot,
huh, girl?

66
00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:31.155
Heel.

67
00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:15.299
How you doing, kiddo?

68
00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:19.237
You, uh, you hungry?

69
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.173
I work on a farm that's
going out of business, Grandpa.

70
00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:24.075
Yes, I'm hungry.

71
00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.786
I bet you're just saying that
so you can sneak

72
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.378
a candy bar back to Hamlet.

73
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:28.679
Maybe.

74
00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:31.382
Farms cost
a lot of dough, kiddo.

75
00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:33.217
The last two harvests,

76
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:34.619
slim pickings,

77
00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:37.355
hurt a lot of farmers
around here.

78
00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:42.059
That's why I came here to
talk business with you, Grandpa.

79
00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:45.363
Business, huh? Sounds serious.

80
00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:47.999
Tell me, how has your, uh,

81
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.635
how is your mama doing?

82
00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:52.903
How come you two
don't talk much?

83
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:57.842
You know, I just decided
to give her a little space

84
00:07:57.975 --> 00:08:00.945
with everything you guys
have been going through.

85
00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:05.349
So, what'd you have in mind?
Lemonade stand? Car wash?

86
00:08:05.483 --> 00:08:06.550
Selling cookies?

87
00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:08.219
You're gonna need a calculator.

88
00:08:08.853 --> 00:08:10.488
Pen and pencil
will do just fine.

89
00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:13.090
I have to help my mom
save our farm.

90
00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:19.330
Well, then, looks like we're
gonna need a calculator after all.

91
00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:21.365
With a lot of zeros.

92
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.268
Step into my office.

93
00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:30.274
So much
for catching the bad guys.

94
00:08:36.647 --> 00:08:38.982
What in the world is that?

95
00:08:42.453 --> 00:08:44.455
Bad guys can hear you coming
a mile away.

96
00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:48.092
Survival of the fittest,
little brother.

97
00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:51.462
Gotta be fast, strong and loud.

98
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:53.230
Or become extinct.

99
00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:56.901
What's he doing in the car?

100
00:08:57.401 --> 00:08:58.636
Spring break week.

101
00:08:58.769 --> 00:08:59.970
Bring your kid to work day.

102
00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:01.539
Bring your kid to work day?

103
00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:03.307
What is the world coming to?

104
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:05.209
You're gonna
make that boy soft, Mike.

105
00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:06.677
Softness gets you nowhere.

106
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.347
'Cause you did
such a good job with your kids.

107
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.851
Hey. My ex sabotaged me
with my own kids.

108
00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:17.621
And that was a long time ago.

109
00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:20.591
Well, I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

110
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.193
Now, look,

111
00:09:22.326 --> 00:09:26.263
I know I can be a little, uh,
rough around the edges

112
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:28.132
but my intentions are good.

113
00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:30.601
Took care of you and Mama
when Daddy...

114
00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:35.506
He was a good man.

115
00:09:35.973 --> 00:09:37.875
Worked too hard. Gone too soon.

116
00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:41.054
But that ain't gonna happen to
us, little brother. You know why?

117
00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.246
Why, Jack?

118
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.883
Because of that land
right out there.

119
00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:48.619
That, Mike, is our future.

120
00:09:49.653 --> 00:09:51.722
Yours, mine, Ethan's.

121
00:09:52.123 --> 00:09:54.291
That land belongs
to Kate Sanders now.

122
00:09:54.425 --> 00:09:56.260
She can't afford
to keep the farm.

123
00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:59.930
Renting the land out for others
to grow crops ain't gonna cut it.

124
00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:02.266
Why do you
want their land, Jack?

125
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.603
They don't want to sell.
You can't take it.

126
00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:07.238
I ain't gonna take it.

127
00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.174
I ain't gonna steal it.

128
00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:12.977
I'm gonna buy it.

129
00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:17.681
I just want to help her and her
little girl get on with their lives.

130
00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:21.820
Just don't do something stupid
we can't fix.

131
00:10:22.253 --> 00:10:23.954
They're nice people.

132
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:29.360
So are we, little brother.

133
00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.496
So are we.

134
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:43.809
Well, it's a good thing there
hasn't been a fire this year.

135
00:10:43.941 --> 00:10:45.109
You gonna be able to fix it?

136
00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:46.610
I'll make her run.

137
00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:48.679
Can't promise for how long.

138
00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:50.514
It is what it is.

139
00:10:51.048 --> 00:10:54.251
Town doesn't have a budget
for a new one for five years.

140
00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:57.655
For the life of me, I don't understand
why you took this job, Kate.

141
00:10:57.788 --> 00:10:59.423
Well, someone has to help out.

142
00:10:59.557 --> 00:11:01.125
Mm, I reckon.

143
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.601
And here we are wondering why

144
00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:12.770
we don't have money
for a new fire truck?

145
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640
Oo-wee!

146
00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:21.979
Ain't she a beauty?

147
00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.818
She gonna be ready
for the May Day parade?

148
00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:29.119
If we tow it, yes.

149
00:11:29.253 --> 00:11:30.054
Hmm.

150
00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:31.322
Maybe what we need to do

151
00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:33.290
is find ourselves
a new mechanic.

152
00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:37.528
Kate, mind if we speak?

153
00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:39.663
Sure.

154
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.236
Did you, uh,
take a look at the offer?

155
00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:48.405
I have. I appreciate it.

156
00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:50.909
But, uh, we ain't selling.

157
00:11:51.442 --> 00:11:55.881
Oh, dear, I mean, you realize
you're not gonna see money like that.

158
00:11:56.413 --> 00:11:58.282
Not for that piece of land.
Definitely.

159
00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:01.151
And really, I'm doing
it out of respect for Clay.

160
00:12:01.585 --> 00:12:04.355
Word is you're thinking
of taking Clay's life insurance

161
00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:06.858
and putting it away
for Alex's college.

162
00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.360
So, Kate,
Kate, you take my deal,

163
00:12:09.493 --> 00:12:11.395
you're not gonna
have to worry about money.

164
00:12:12.062 --> 00:12:13.182
All you gotta do is sign it.

165
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.698
I'm gonna take care of the rest.

166
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.700
I think you gotta
let it go, Sheriff.

167
00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.202
I better let it go?

168
00:12:18.702 --> 00:12:19.702
Yeah.

169
00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:21.472
Let it go.

170
00:12:21.973 --> 00:12:22.973
Yeah.

171
00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.242
That was my family land
for generations.

172
00:12:25.376 --> 00:12:27.645
Before your father-in-law
stole it.

173
00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:32.383
From my daddy.

174
00:12:33.517 --> 00:12:35.653
My father-in-law,
he paid a fair price.

175
00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:37.321
Mm, Kate.

176
00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:41.191
No. You're at the bottom
of the hill looking up.

177
00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:44.061
Well, I think we'll manage.

178
00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:47.999
I just hate
to see you lose it all.

179
00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:50.401
So, tell you what I'm gonna do.

180
00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:53.103
Give you some more time
to think about it.

181
00:12:54.104 --> 00:12:55.339
Okay then.

182
00:12:55.773 --> 00:12:56.773
Okay.

183
00:12:57.842 --> 00:12:58.910
Good day, Kate.

184
00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:00.879
Have a good day, Sheriff.

185
00:14:13.985 --> 00:14:14.985
How bad is it?

186
00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.221
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it.

187
00:14:17.788 --> 00:14:18.788
It ain't good.

188
00:14:19.657 --> 00:14:22.961
I tried to tell your mom and dad when I
gave them the farm for a wedding present,

189
00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:24.528
but, you know...

190
00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:27.698
your mama
don't want to hear it from me.

191
00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.501
It's a beautiful place, Grandpa.

192
00:14:32.469 --> 00:14:33.771
We can't lose it.

193
00:14:37.174 --> 00:14:38.642
It's where Daddy's buried.

194
00:14:44.115 --> 00:14:45.950
I didn't agree with that either.

195
00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:49.954
Should've had
a proper military burial.

196
00:14:51.722 --> 00:14:52.957
Arlington maybe.

197
00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:57.661
You two could have
come lived with me.

198
00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:00.131
We need you, Grandpa.

199
00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:02.733
It's me asking
because Mom won't.

200
00:15:28.425 --> 00:15:29.560
Hello, Officer.

201
00:15:30.527 --> 00:15:31.896
Was I speeding?

202
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:33.898
Well, I certainly hope not

203
00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:37.802
because, uh, that was
painfully slow.

204
00:15:38.402 --> 00:15:40.038
But you got
some out of state tags,

205
00:15:40.171 --> 00:15:41.906
so I'll need to see some ID?

206
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.076
You just passing through?

207
00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:47.711
You could say that.
I'm visiting.

208
00:15:48.278 --> 00:15:49.278
Oh.

209
00:15:49.613 --> 00:15:51.248
Who might that be?

210
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.581
I'm sorry, but does it matter?

211
00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:55.153
It matters if I say it does.

212
00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:58.722
You got a license for that dog?

213
00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.897
Ooh, where'd you serve?

214
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.698
Afghanistan.

215
00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.301
You a friend of Clay Sanders?

216
00:16:12.036 --> 00:16:13.138
I am.

217
00:16:13.704 --> 00:16:15.706
That is tragic
what happened to him.

218
00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.880
A ticket for out of state tags?

219
00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:26.583
Dakota, heel.

220
00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:28.352
I'm sorry about that.

221
00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:30.955
She's normally
a great judge of character.

222
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.825
Well, you should be careful

223
00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.694
because, uh,
this ain't a dog friendly town.

224
00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:53.377
Come on. Good girl. Good girl.

225
00:17:30.414 --> 00:17:31.582
Stay.

226
00:17:37.922 --> 00:17:39.756
I'm just gonna
save you the time.

227
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.627
- I'm CJ. I, uh...
- We're not interested in selling.

228
00:17:44.795 --> 00:17:45.795
Kate?

229
00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:48.665
Knowing my
name ain't gonna help.

230
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.702
You're one of them vultures.

231
00:17:52.402 --> 00:17:53.402
Vultures.

232
00:17:53.503 --> 00:17:56.373
Sir, please get off our land.

233
00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:00.711
Now.

234
00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:05.415
I served with Clay.

235
00:18:10.221 --> 00:18:12.389
I came to bring you
his things, ma'am.

236
00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:18.830
I promised that I would
bring her home to you.

237
00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:21.431
Heel!

238
00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:25.602
This is Dakota.
Clay's best friend.

239
00:18:26.938 --> 00:18:28.006
It's Dakota?

240
00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:32.476
Hi, girl.

241
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:36.848
I, I thought they weren't
allowed to come home.

242
00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:39.050
Yeah, well, she is retired now.

243
00:18:39.884 --> 00:18:41.585
It was a special request.

244
00:18:41.718 --> 00:18:43.821
Last thing we need
is a dog, sir.

245
00:18:45.656 --> 00:18:48.159
Dakota. Shoot. Uh...

246
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.661
Sorry. Hey!

247
00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:53.563
I think I know
where she's going.

248
00:19:16.087 --> 00:19:18.957
This was Clay's
favorite place as a child.

249
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.660
That's why
I chose to bury him here.

250
00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.198
Dakota hasn't
been the same since.

251
00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:31.002
She runs off every chance
she gets trying to find him.

252
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.972
- She can't stay.
- Alex, don't be rude.

253
00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:36.207
I don't need a dog.
I need my dad!

254
00:19:43.247 --> 00:19:45.615
Things have been hard on her
the past few months.

255
00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:49.420
You know, I shouldn't have just
dropped in on you like this.

256
00:19:49.553 --> 00:19:50.955
It's okay.

257
00:19:51.555 --> 00:19:53.790
I, I just wasn't expecting...

258
00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:56.660
A stranger? And a dog?

259
00:19:58.162 --> 00:20:00.298
She looks
different than the pictures.

260
00:20:00.664 --> 00:20:02.900
She's thinner. Yeah.

261
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.003
She'll come around.

262
00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.817
You know, if there's
anything that I can do,

263
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.209
I'm happy to help.

264
00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.080
Any chance you know
how to fix a leaky sink?

265
00:21:27.118 --> 00:21:28.652
Uh. Okay.

266
00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:30.855
Hi. Personal space.

267
00:21:33.723 --> 00:21:35.426
Don't get too used to this.

268
00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:01.185
How's it coming along?

269
00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:03.787
Can you turn
on the faucet, please?

270
00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:11.328
All right.

271
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.999
Loose pipe.

272
00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.170
Looks like we did it.

273
00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:21.239
I'm not sure "we" was much help.

274
00:22:21.372 --> 00:22:24.609
Well, somebody had
to turn the water on.

275
00:22:24.741 --> 00:22:27.011
That counts as a team effort.

276
00:22:27.378 --> 00:22:31.415
All right. Well, uh,
I should be, uh, heading back.

277
00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:33.184
Tonight?

278
00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:36.287
I mean,

279
00:22:36.954 --> 00:22:39.423
it's a long ride
to North Carolina.

280
00:22:40.124 --> 00:22:41.926
I saw a motel up the road.

281
00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:43.760
I got a few days R&R.

282
00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:46.097
Thought I'd take
my time driving back.

283
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.099
Maybe stop in Knoxville.

284
00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:51.135
I got some friends there.

285
00:22:51.569 --> 00:22:52.603
We got an extra room.

286
00:22:54.238 --> 00:22:56.174
And a friend of Clay's
is always welcome here.

287
00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:00.845
Dakota will be happy.

288
00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:03.848
She really loved Clay.

289
00:23:04.248 --> 00:23:05.416
Hard not to.

290
00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:07.485
Just such a good man.

291
00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:08.953
Yeah.

292
00:23:10.855 --> 00:23:12.722
Uh, when I was driving in,

293
00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:14.301
I saw you got
a big hole in your corral.

294
00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:16.726
It's just so hard
to keep up with everything.

295
00:23:16.861 --> 00:23:18.695
I mean, I try,
but without Clay...

296
00:23:18.829 --> 00:23:21.832
I'm not saying that my carpentry
skills are as good as my plumbing.

297
00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:23.401
Is that so?

298
00:23:23.534 --> 00:23:26.137
They're not bad for, you know,
a city boy from Chicago.

299
00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:29.258
At least we got
the best pizza in the world.

300
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.442
Well, I guess you never had
homemade Georgia pizza.

301
00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.044
Did you say pizza or peaches?

302
00:23:33.177 --> 00:23:35.313
Okay, very funny,
Mister Big City Boy.

303
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.850
You see about the fence, and
I'll see about lunch tomorrow.

304
00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:41.318
Okay. Deal.

305
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.720
Deal, soldier.

306
00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:00.137
Princess, meet Dakota.

307
00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:02.840
Princess is my favorite.

308
00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:11.781
Hamlet, meet Dakota.

309
00:24:18.889 --> 00:24:20.424
That went well. Not.

310
00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:31.502
Dakota, meet the Dirty Dozen.

311
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.639
That's Captain Cluck.

312
00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:37.475
All the hens think he's cute.

313
00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.878
Mom says it has something to do
with his red mohawk.

314
00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:20.084
What's wrong?

315
00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:22.286
Jeez.

316
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.222
Don't just stand there.
It's creepy. Come on.

317
00:25:38.569 --> 00:25:40.738
I can teach her a few commands.

318
00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:43.574
I mean, Dakota will
respond quickly, I think.

319
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.376
I'd appreciate that.

320
00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:47.678
Why is she anxious sometimes?

321
00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:49.313
PTSD.

322
00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:52.116
You know, we have parents,
brothers, sisters, friends.

323
00:25:52.249 --> 00:25:54.085
All she ever had was Clay.

324
00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:56.287
He never let Dakota down.

325
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:59.056
<i>They always
had each other's backs.</i>

326
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.490
I'm good.

327
00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:06.497
Help me
get these people home, Dakota.

328
00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:08.566
You hear me?

329
00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.240
We got a bomb, soldiers.

330
00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:45.469
Heel. Come on.

331
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.071
Heel.

332
00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.617
Honey, what's wrong?

333
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:51.843
She won't listen to me.

334
00:26:51.976 --> 00:26:53.010
You gotta try harder.

335
00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:54.678
It's what she is trained to do.

336
00:26:55.112 --> 00:26:56.112
You gotta stay calm.

337
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.615
We can't afford her.

338
00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:02.553
We'll find a way.
She's part of our family.

339
00:27:02.686 --> 00:27:04.789
I can pay for the food.
It's no worries.

340
00:27:04.922 --> 00:27:06.490
She's just gonna
run off anyways.

341
00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:07.925
Alex, please.

342
00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:09.293
We're not Dad.

343
00:27:09.727 --> 00:27:11.897
How do we know
she just won't leave us?

344
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:13.764
I know this is hard.

345
00:27:14.331 --> 00:27:15.834
But we're all she has now.

346
00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:18.870
- Make some room in your heart for her.
- But...

347
00:27:19.003 --> 00:27:20.806
And don't say you can't.

348
00:27:20.938 --> 00:27:22.440
I know that you can.

349
00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:25.743
You know the most amazing thing
about hearts

350
00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:28.145
is they can let in so much.

351
00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.381
Even when they're hurt.

352
00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:43.661
I know you can do this.

353
00:27:48.732 --> 00:27:49.801
Wanna try again?

354
00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:51.168
Like Daddy would want?

355
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.207
Dakota.

356
00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:04.482
Dakota, heel.

357
00:28:10.988 --> 00:28:11.988
Heel.

358
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:13.524
Heel.

359
00:28:15.392 --> 00:28:16.627
Heel.

360
00:28:17.194 --> 00:28:19.063
Good girl. Good girl.

361
00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:23.133
Dakota, heel.

362
00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.570
Come on. Let's go.

363
00:28:59.703 --> 00:29:01.572
So this is Dakota.

364
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.809
Heard a lot about you, girl.

365
00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.111
Dad's friend CJ
brought her home to us.

366
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.046
She's such a good girl.

367
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.682
Her and Dad were partners 100%.

368
00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:14.518
She seems to really like you.

369
00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:16.720
Well, marine...

370
00:29:19.523 --> 00:29:21.292
nice to finally meet you.

371
00:29:22.493 --> 00:29:23.828
You're a good girl.

372
00:29:24.361 --> 00:29:26.031
I heard so much about you, baby.

373
00:29:26.463 --> 00:29:29.968
Huh? Hmm? How you doin'?
How you doin'?

374
00:29:45.182 --> 00:29:47.318
- Hey, Alex.
- Oh, hey.

375
00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:48.552
Who's your friend?

376
00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.055
This is Dakota.

377
00:29:50.187 --> 00:29:52.089
She was my Dad's.

378
00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:55.759
Oh, she's really special.
So was your dad, but...

379
00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:58.529
Oh.

380
00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:04.201
All right, you just ate it.
You can take it.

381
00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:16.081
Uh, you know, Ethan,

382
00:30:16.213 --> 00:30:17.781
you and Alex
should become friends.

383
00:30:18.215 --> 00:30:19.593
I am playing
with my friends right now.

384
00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:20.617
Online.

385
00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:22.586
You don't game?

386
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.254
Oh.

387
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:27.058
No.

388
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:28.668
My Mom says I can get
a phone for my birthday, tho.

389
00:30:28.692 --> 00:30:30.132
- You don't have a...
- Ethan.

390
00:30:30.227 --> 00:30:31.830
But you don't
even know these guys.

391
00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.298
Bet you Alex has
a bunch of real life friends.

392
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.470
Yeah, like Princess.
Hamlet. Captain Cluck.

393
00:30:41.538 --> 00:30:43.707
Awesome nicknames. I think.

394
00:30:45.175 --> 00:30:46.243
And Dakota.

395
00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.611
Hey there.

396
00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:51.482
Smart, too. Dakota, heel.

397
00:30:55.352 --> 00:30:56.587
Good girl.

398
00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:59.056
See you later.

399
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.691
Bye, Alex.

400
00:31:06.563 --> 00:31:07.832
So, Dakota,

401
00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:10.300
I'm gonna show you
where Daddy used to work.

402
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:19.343
Stairs are probably safer.

403
00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:34.959
No way.

404
00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:45.904
You like to dig
more than any dog I know.

405
00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.416
What is he doing here?

406
00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:08.059
Well, looks like
you found yourself a job.

407
00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:09.961
Anything I can do to help out.

408
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.762
Yeah.

409
00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:15.365
Yeah, I'm sure that you are
more than willing to help out.

410
00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:31.315
Wow.

411
00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.354
Is there something
I can do for you, Sheriff?

412
00:32:40.424 --> 00:32:41.792
I'll let you know.

413
00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.709
You know, I hit
a hole in one here back in '92.

414
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.845
I know, Grandpa. I know.

415
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:04.615
Only problem was
God was my only witness.

416
00:33:05.415 --> 00:33:06.683
Now I got you.

417
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:08.987
Behold, Alex.

418
00:33:09.753 --> 00:33:10.753
Behold.

419
00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:13.390
Ugh!

420
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.927
You, young lady,
did not just see that.

421
00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:24.768
You've gotta be kidding me.

422
00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:27.071
I love it, girl. Come on, girl!

423
00:33:27.504 --> 00:33:29.007
Would you get a load of this.

424
00:33:30.407 --> 00:33:32.309
Look at that.
That was beautiful, girl.

425
00:33:32.442 --> 00:33:34.444
Nice job! Beautiful.

426
00:33:34.578 --> 00:33:36.446
Look at that.

427
00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:42.686
You know, it's been a,
been a long time since...

428
00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.622
we had a nice family dog.

429
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.724
Yep.

430
00:33:51.695 --> 00:33:52.897
What you got there?

431
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.800
Found it on the farm.
Dakota dug it up.

432
00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:58.002
Kinda' pretty
if you polish it up a bit.

433
00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.271
Now you got
a new dog and a pet rock.

434
00:34:01.738 --> 00:34:05.310
This is what they call
a mulligan, Alex.

435
00:34:05.442 --> 00:34:06.311
A mulligan?

436
00:34:06.443 --> 00:34:08.445
That's right. A do-over.

437
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.348
Grip it and rip it, baby.

438
00:34:11.815 --> 00:34:12.815
Oh!

439
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.253
Oh!

440
00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.003
Smokey in the trees?

441
00:34:35.405 --> 00:34:36.639
I got this.

442
00:34:38.442 --> 00:34:39.442
I got this.

443
00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:53.858
Please start. Please start.

444
00:34:56.493 --> 00:34:57.628
Yes!

445
00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.084
Fire! Come on, Dakota.

446
00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.486
Fire, huh?

447
00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:25.522
You just leave Dakota
back here with me.

448
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:29.060
Fire?

449
00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.727
Come on, Dakota, let's go!

450
00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:31.862
Fire!

451
00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.412
Alice, where's the fire?

452
00:35:47.544 --> 00:35:49.113
- Smokey.
- Mom!

453
00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.988
They say where there's smoke
there's fire,

454
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.555
but I don't see nothing.

455
00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.691
That's Smokey?

456
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:03.428
I didn't know what else to do.
He's all I have.

457
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.930
Smokey in the trees.

458
00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:07.198
Okay.

459
00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:09.167
- Let's save Smokey.
- Hurry up!

460
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.436
He has never
even climbed a tree before.

461
00:36:11.568 --> 00:36:13.037
Smokey's a feline.

462
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.339
It's in their DNA.

463
00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:17.574
Like a soldier who was born
to protect your freedom.

464
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.411
Cats, they, uh,
they climb trees.

465
00:36:21.611 --> 00:36:22.713
Yeah.

466
00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:30.721
Looks like we got a hook
and ladder without the ladder.

467
00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.966
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

468
00:36:37.095 --> 00:36:38.396
Oh!

469
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.069
Dakota.

470
00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:51.775
Oh!

471
00:37:04.554 --> 00:37:07.158
Are you sure the cat's okay?

472
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.559
Oh, you little rascal.

473
00:37:11.595 --> 00:37:13.031
- Okay.
- Beautiful!

474
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.900
- Girl, come here!
- Good girl! Good girl!

475
00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:18.069
Oh, you are a hero. Good job!

476
00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.840
Oh, my little baby.

477
00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:25.542
Look who came. I was so worried.

478
00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.146
Nice job, kiddo.

479
00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:31.416
Thanks.

480
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.952
Listen, I know I haven't
been around for a while.

481
00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:37.088
You and me, we...

482
00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:40.191
We haven't had a chance to talk.

483
00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:44.495
Yeah. Yeah, me, me, too.

484
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.365
I just,
I been pretty busy lately.

485
00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:48.800
Alex told me.

486
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:54.038
I didn't realize how, uh,
things got so tough.

487
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240
Listen, Kate.

488
00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:00.912
I want to say I'm sorry

489
00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:03.314
for the way
I handled Clay's funeral, okay?

490
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:04.916
That was your decision.

491
00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.717
I should've stayed out of it.

492
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:11.289
Thanks, Dad.

493
00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:17.929
You know,
when you and Clay got married,

494
00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.231
I loved when you
started calling me Dad.

495
00:38:20.832 --> 00:38:21.899
Missed that.

496
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.804
I just want
what's best for you and Alex.

497
00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:30.408
Who's such a good girl?

498
00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:32.176
I'm so proud of you.

499
00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:34.178
She's just like him.

500
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.314
She sure is.

501
00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.950
You're a hero!

502
00:38:49.793 --> 00:38:52.196
Target. Left flank. Get down.

503
00:38:54.798 --> 00:38:56.234
Hold your fire.

504
00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.337
Okay, soldiers. Stand down.

505
00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:05.910
Almost back to home base.

506
00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.712
Just six months from now
we'll be home.

507
00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.388
What the...

508
00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:27.757
Somebody here?

509
00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.694
Oh, no.

510
00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:31.128
Doggie?

511
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.262
Stay, dog.

512
00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.265
Don't you bite me!

513
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.388
So, uh,

514
00:40:58.788 --> 00:41:00.291
- nothing's missing.
- No.

515
00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:01.425
But why break in?

516
00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.228
It just...
It doesn't make any sense.

517
00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.633
What is it, girl?

518
00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.272
Mom, they've been cut.

519
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.419
But whoever lives in the truth

520
00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.688
will come into the light,

521
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.690
so that it can be seen clearly

522
00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:36.227
that what he has done
has been done through God.

523
00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:39.063
Psst. Hey, dog.

524
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.901
Look what I got for you.

525
00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:47.738
Oh, I've got some nice,
refreshing gelato.

526
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.442
That's it. Come on.

527
00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:53.411
Come on, Dakota.

528
00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.546
Come on. That's it.

529
00:41:56.314 --> 00:41:58.949
Wow. Who doesn't love
some gelato

530
00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.385
on a hot day like this?

531
00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:04.488
That's right.

532
00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:09.527
Everybody loves gelato.

533
00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:13.264
As so profoundly
written in the scriptures,

534
00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:16.233
John 8:32.

535
00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.538
"Ye shall see the truth.

536
00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:24.608
And the truth
will make you free."

537
00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:32.516
<i>Mm...</i>

538
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.721
<i>Ain't nothing more refreshing
on a hot day than gelato.</i>

539
00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.789
That's right, puppy. Come on.

540
00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:42.293
Come on. Got plenty more
where that came from.

541
00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:48.099
Hey, dog. Looking for this?

542
00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:57.809
We've got
a big surprise for you.

543
00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:04.850
Ha, this gonna be fun, boss.

544
00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:06.050
Come on.

545
00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:08.986
There's only room
for one alpha dog in this town.

546
00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:10.653
And that's me.

547
00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:22.933
My car!

548
00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.468
She's scratching
my beautiful car!

549
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:27.004
What are you doing, man?
Come on, get down here! Get!

550
00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.542
You have got to be kidding me?

551
00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.586
I'm sorry, boss.

552
00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.991
I am gonna get you, dog.

553
00:43:57.803 --> 00:43:59.413
Thank you so
much, everybody, for coming.

554
00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:01.972
Go in peace. Keep the faith.

555
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.618
She's such a good girl.

556
00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:17.021
I know.

557
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.989
Dakota.

558
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.670
Is this how you spend
all your Sunday nights?

559
00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:35.239
Pretty much.

560
00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:38.476
There's always something
needs doing around here.

561
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.478
Right in there.

562
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.082
Thank you.

563
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:50.087
Did Clay ever tell you
he was Camden's fire chief?

564
00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:53.257
No. He didn't.

565
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.526
I kind of
inherited the position.

566
00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:59.096
He loved this place.

567
00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:03.845
- Hey, you okay?
- Kate, there's something

568
00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:06.270
I gotta tell you,
and it can't wait any longer.

569
00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:10.207
It's about Dakota.

570
00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:15.212
You're making me nervous.

571
00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.615
The reason that I'm here,

572
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:20.184
the reason I'm alive

573
00:45:21.987 --> 00:45:23.220
is because of her.

574
00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.457
And Clay.

575
00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:28.359
What do you mean?

576
00:45:28.927 --> 00:45:30.160
She...

577
00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:32.029
I'm, I'm sorry.
That's an emergency call.

578
00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:33.664
I, I gotta take it.

579
00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:35.266
I'm sorry.

580
00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:37.802
Fire station.

581
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.905
What's your emergency please?

582
00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:42.273
June Dwyre's place?

583
00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:45.543
I know. Route 54.

584
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.914
I'm, I'm on my way okay?
It's gonna be okay.

585
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.882
Hey, something wrong?

586
00:45:51.016 --> 00:45:52.149
There's a real fire.

587
00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:56.220
Alex, you and Dakota,
you get inside now.

588
00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.355
Come on.

589
00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.257
This is a volunteer
fire department,

590
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:02.192
okay? And, and I volunteer you.

591
00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.603
What's happening, Mom?
Is there a fire?

592
00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:05.262
It's okay, honey.
You just stay here.

593
00:46:05.396 --> 00:46:06.932
We'll be right back, okay?
Come on.

594
00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.332
- I need you.
- Stay.

595
00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:14.672
Come on, Dakota.

596
00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.145
They might need your help.

597
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:22.212
Come on, Dakota.

598
00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.389
Help! My mama's in there!

599
00:46:34.993 --> 00:46:36.861
I don't see any cats.
This is the real deal.

600
00:46:36.995 --> 00:46:39.163
Okay. Let's move!

601
00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:42.166
Grab the hoses.
Just like we trained, okay?

602
00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:43.734
Okay, I got it!

603
00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.238
Alex! Stay back!

604
00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.809
Kate!

605
00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:56.180
Kate, do not go in there!

606
00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:57.547
Kate!

607
00:46:59.717 --> 00:47:01.086
Mom!

608
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.857
No! No!

609
00:47:05.991 --> 00:47:08.225
No, no! No, Dakota.

610
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.461
This is what she does.

611
00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:22.473
To the moon and back, Clay.

612
00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.878
To the moon and back.

613
00:47:32.884 --> 00:47:35.786
Kate! Kate!

614
00:47:38.056 --> 00:47:40.491
Mom!

615
00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:54.839
- Mama!
- Mom!

616
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:01.245
Dakota!

617
00:48:10.989 --> 00:48:11.989
Mama.

618
00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:18.395
Mom, you
and Dakota were amazing.

619
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.668
- Don't do that again.
- No.

620
00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.558
Bravo.

621
00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.393
Bravo.

622
00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.328
So our volunteer fire department

623
00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:53.731
can actually put out a fire.

624
00:48:55.033 --> 00:48:56.300
Y'all are heroes.

625
00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:04.175
I didn't know you were
sticking around here, soldier boy.

626
00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.610
Turned you into a fireman, huh?

627
00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:12.249
What's next? Doctor?

628
00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:14.251
A lawyer?

629
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.888
Mom, I haven't seen Dakota.

630
00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.997
Missing your dog there, missy?

631
00:49:32.871 --> 00:49:35.240
<i>Suspect has been apprehended.</i>

632
00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:36.607
Copy that.

633
00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:40.310
This could've been a lot worse.

634
00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.046
Y'all should be proud.

635
00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:47.751
What are we gonna do?

636
00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:05.002
Here.

637
00:50:16.214 --> 00:50:17.581
She'll be back, hon.

638
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:23.855
CJ said she does that sometimes.

639
00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:27.457
She's a trained soldier,

640
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:30.427
so exploring is part of her job.

641
00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.598
She doesn't like to be alone.

642
00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.805
Grandpa is gonna help me
put fliers up in the morning.

643
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840
Good.

644
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:46.510
Then you better get to bed.

645
00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.852
You make sure to say
a prayer for Dakota. Okay?

646
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.791
I love you.

647
00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:06.865
I love you.

648
00:51:17.342 --> 00:51:18.342
Good night.

649
00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.576
Good night, baby.

650
00:51:30.822 --> 00:51:33.490
Please, God, bring Dakota home.

651
00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:48.873
Thanks.

652
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.077
Alex okay?

653
00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:55.280
Yeah.

654
00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:57.949
I told her you said
Dakota would be okay.

655
00:51:58.883 --> 00:52:02.452
I meant to tell you,
you did real good tonight.

656
00:52:03.855 --> 00:52:06.623
Just doin' my part, I guess.

657
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.962
Is something on your mind?

658
00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.429
Danforth.

659
00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.033
I don't trust him.

660
00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.834
Never have.

661
00:52:17.668 --> 00:52:20.470
You be careful, he's bad news.

662
00:52:20.905 --> 00:52:23.473
You know, we had plans
to fix up this place,

663
00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.642
turn it into a working farm.

664
00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:28.212
Funny how life
can change so fast.

665
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.514
Yes, it can.

666
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:32.649
It does.

667
00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:36.120
I just got the call.

668
00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:40.058
I'm due back at the base
day after tomorrow.

669
00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:43.694
I didn't realize
it would be so soon.

670
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:47.798
We're all gonna
miss you around here.

671
00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:50.201
Me, too.

672
00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.939
Kate.

673
00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.941
About Clay,

674
00:52:57.842 --> 00:52:59.543
what I meant
to tell you earlier...

675
00:53:04.816 --> 00:53:06.818
They attacked us
early in the morning.

676
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:09.387
We need to flank them
from the other side.

677
00:53:09.854 --> 00:53:12.489
Most of us were wounded,
including Clay.

678
00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.525
We couldn't see anything.

679
00:53:18.429 --> 00:53:20.031
We were fighting off insurgents.

680
00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.335
They had us pinned by RPG...

681
00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:25.837
You don't need to tell me this.

682
00:53:26.938 --> 00:53:28.172
I know what happened.

683
00:53:30.141 --> 00:53:31.809
I saw your scars.

684
00:53:35.079 --> 00:53:36.079
Kate.

685
00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:39.984
Nobody really knows.

686
00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:43.086
I was scared.

687
00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.056
I couldn't move.

688
00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:46.824
Clay, he knew it.

689
00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:49.972
<i>Dakota, she was protecting Clay.</i>

690
00:53:50.061 --> 00:53:52.063
<i>She would not leave his side.</i>

691
00:53:52.997 --> 00:53:55.166
But Clay,
he ordered her to save me.

692
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.302
And Dakota,
she followed that order.

693
00:53:59.137 --> 00:54:00.637
Dakota, get CJ.

694
00:54:02.273 --> 00:54:04.242
That's my girl.

695
00:54:06.277 --> 00:54:07.711
So Clay should be here.

696
00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:10.181
It's not your fault.

697
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.952
It is all that I think about.

698
00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:18.423
And you and Alex,

699
00:54:18.856 --> 00:54:21.025
you need Clay here
now more than ever.

700
00:54:24.395 --> 00:54:25.729
And I'm sorry.

701
00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:28.933
You're here.

702
00:54:31.903 --> 00:54:33.637
Clay made sure of it.

703
00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:38.209
And that means
you're right where you belong.

704
00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.554
Hey.

705
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.189
Got a lost dog.

706
00:55:26.958 --> 00:55:28.792
Name's Dakota.

707
00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.134
Here, it's for my dog.

708
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:38.768
Okay. Yeah.

709
00:55:45.877 --> 00:55:47.945
You don't need
to hang those up anymore.

710
00:55:50.148 --> 00:55:51.148
Follow me.

711
00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:00.358
Why would Dakota be
in a jail for humans?

712
00:56:01.425 --> 00:56:04.362
I had to go to my uncle's last
night to drop off his uniform.

713
00:56:04.495 --> 00:56:06.430
He uses our washer and dryer,
the weirdo.

714
00:56:06.964 --> 00:56:08.698
Anyway,
I heard him on the phone.

715
00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:10.767
They're gonna transfer
Dakota to the pound.

716
00:56:10.902 --> 00:56:12.336
We don't have much time.

717
00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:17.441
Go in the side door.

718
00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.710
- Which key?
- It shall reveal itself.

719
00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:22.813
- Reveal itself?
- Trust me.

720
00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:25.315
Oh.

721
00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:28.819
Why are you helping me?

722
00:56:28.953 --> 00:56:30.354
I like dogs.

723
00:56:32.423 --> 00:56:33.790
And you're okay, too.

724
00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:57.882
All
right. It shall reveal itself.

725
00:56:58.015 --> 00:57:00.351
<i>Try the
one that says "Side Door".</i>

726
00:57:00.484 --> 00:57:02.620
Why didn't you tell me
you marked the keys?

727
00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.322
Where's the adventure in that?

728
00:57:14.165 --> 00:57:15.266
Whoo.

729
00:57:16.334 --> 00:57:17.734
Let's get down
to the diner, man.

730
00:57:17.868 --> 00:57:19.437
I'm starving.
Let's grab some lunch.

731
00:57:27.245 --> 00:57:28.246
Hey.

732
00:57:36.621 --> 00:57:37.989
There you are.

733
00:57:41.626 --> 00:57:47.431
This is where Sheriff Danforth
hides his secret stash.

734
00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:57.275
Don't say a word
to anybody about this.

735
00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:02.213
Don't worry, man. Not a word.

736
00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:12.056
<i>So that explains
where all the toilet paper goes.</i>

737
00:58:21.632 --> 00:58:22.833
Uh-oh.

738
00:58:22.967 --> 00:58:23.834
<i>What? What is it?</i>

739
00:58:23.968 --> 00:58:25.403
Sheriff just pulled up.

740
00:58:28.406 --> 00:58:30.041
<i>Just get Dakota.</i>

741
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:35.279
Oh, no.

742
00:58:35.713 --> 00:58:36.814
We got more company.

743
00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:46.857
Dakota!

744
00:58:50.061 --> 00:58:51.829
There you are, girl.

745
00:58:56.534 --> 00:58:57.835
Hey.

746
00:59:00.237 --> 00:59:02.073
What is it now, Mike?

747
00:59:02.206 --> 00:59:04.475
I hope you aren't
doing something stupid.

748
00:59:04.608 --> 00:59:06.043
Like what?

749
00:59:06.944 --> 00:59:08.412
You know anything about this?

750
00:59:08.913 --> 00:59:09.980
Hey, boss.

751
00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:11.649
She's inside.

752
00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:13.884
Way to go, knuckleheads.

753
00:59:14.018 --> 00:59:15.319
Who's inside?

754
00:59:24.628 --> 00:59:25.963
Uh-oh. Alex?

755
00:59:26.097 --> 00:59:28.099
You might want
to pick it up a bit.

756
00:59:31.302 --> 00:59:33.437
What is going on here?

757
00:59:34.872 --> 00:59:36.207
Enough of the games, Jack.

758
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.476
What is this all about?

759
00:59:45.516 --> 00:59:47.819
What in the Sam heck
is going on here?

760
01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.366
Dog?

761
01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.943
You sleeping, dog?

762
01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.452
Dog?

763
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.230
No!

764
01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.334
Go, go. Go.

765
01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:38.936
Come on, girl.

766
01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:50.849
Michael, that dog has escaped.

767
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.017
- Dog? W... what dog?
- Move.

768
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.085
I'm trying. You move.

769
01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:56.387
I said, move!

770
01:00:57.755 --> 01:00:59.256
Michael.

771
01:01:03.929 --> 01:01:05.262
Stupid.

772
01:01:42.233 --> 01:01:43.467
We did it!

773
01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:47.571
Thanks, Ethan, that was awesome.

774
01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:52.476
You two should keep moving.

775
01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:56.247
Oh, uh, one more thing, Alex.

776
01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.626
I noticed something else strange
at my Uncle Jack's house last night.

777
01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.353
He has some kind of geology
chart and map of the town.

778
01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:04.388
He had the Sanders' Farm
circled on it.

779
01:02:04.522 --> 01:02:06.423
Thanks, Ethan.

780
01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:08.197
I, I know you didn't
have to tell me that.

781
01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:09.995
Now get out of here
and be careful.

782
01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.328
Okay.

783
01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:16.500
Coming through.
Let's go, Dakota.

784
01:02:40.558 --> 01:02:42.359
I've made you some coffee.

785
01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:44.627
Thanks.

786
01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.364
You sure you have to leave now?

787
01:02:52.804 --> 01:02:55.439
Told you she'd be back.

788
01:02:56.841 --> 01:02:58.877
- Where did you find her?
- Hi, girl.

789
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:00.511
Long story.

790
01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:03.614
CJ, where you going?

791
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:07.484
I gotta go, little lady.

792
01:03:07.919 --> 01:03:09.386
I gotta get back to work.

793
01:03:09.821 --> 01:03:11.188
Well, you can work here.

794
01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.592
Uh, it doesn't work that way.

795
01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:17.628
But we'll see you again,
won't we?

796
01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.497
No goodbyes.

797
01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:21.866
No goodbyes.

798
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.616
Take care of Dakota.

799
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:41.051
Of course.

800
01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.162
What is the emergency?

801
01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.700
Take it easy, bud.

802
01:04:29.834 --> 01:04:31.635
Well, you radioed in
it was urgent.

803
01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:34.304
What? You lose another puppy?

804
01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.041
This is serious little brother.

805
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.275
It's time I leveled with you.

806
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:41.478
Let you in on a little secret
about this land here.

807
01:04:41.913 --> 01:04:44.348
Oh, we have been over
this before. Kate ain't selling.

808
01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.717
The bank forecloses on Friday.

809
01:04:47.152 --> 01:04:49.453
What? How do you know that?

810
01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:52.322
I know everything
that goes on in my town.

811
01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:54.926
Why have you had it
in for them all these years?

812
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.630
Well, there's history here,
little brother.

813
01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.669
- Take a look at that.
- Oh.

814
01:05:05.804 --> 01:05:08.605
Great. Nice rock.

815
01:05:11.542 --> 01:05:12.877
Those are diamonds.

816
01:05:14.112 --> 01:05:15.847
- Diamonds?
- Hmm.

817
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.916
Where did you find this?

818
01:05:18.449 --> 01:05:20.185
The story goes,

819
01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:24.155
a miner found diamonds near
here in the 1800s in Hall County.

820
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:26.323
Pop found that piece

821
01:05:26.457 --> 01:05:29.526
just before Monty Sanders
took over the deed.

822
01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.864
Well, I did not know that.

823
01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.531
Well, you were young.

824
01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.568
But I swore to him
before he passed

825
01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.237
that I would get the land
back in the Danforth name.

826
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.573
This has been your plan
the whole time?

827
01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:50.014
Whatever's out there,

828
01:05:50.915 --> 01:05:52.416
diamonds or not,

829
01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:56.253
legally belongs
to Kate and Alex.

830
01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:57.688
Oh, come on, Mike.

831
01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:01.092
I don't like what happened
to Clay any more than you do.

832
01:06:01.226 --> 01:06:04.229
There's times in your life
that you gotta step up, man.

833
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.462
This time...

834
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:12.003
Oh, look who's here.

835
01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.005
Look who's here.

836
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.573
You know, that CJ fellow
left this morning.

837
01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:18.575
Now it's time
for this dog to go.

838
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.745
We don't need anything else
getting dug up around here.

839
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:28.552
Are you sure this isn't more about
revenge than diamonds, Sheriff?

840
01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:32.723
I'm warning you.

841
01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:36.127
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way.

842
01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.430
You understand me,
little brother?

843
01:06:43.034 --> 01:06:44.468
Stay out of my way.

844
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.634
I remember now.

845
01:07:53.238 --> 01:07:55.706
Al-x marks the spot.

846
01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:01.678
We ain't selling!

847
01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:03.747
If you get foreclosed on,

848
01:08:03.882 --> 01:08:06.851
you are gonna be
holding a big bag of nothing!

849
01:08:07.285 --> 01:08:09.187
Okay, I just need another week.

850
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.922
I, I, I'll find the money!

851
01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.930
Put that dog on a leash or else!

852
01:08:20.832 --> 01:08:22.666
Don't you talk to my daughter
like that.

853
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.533
Oh, come on, Kate.

854
01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.238
Take the deal while you are
getting a more than fair price.

855
01:08:27.372 --> 01:08:31.707
- Take it!
- Why do you want our land so bad, Sheriff?

856
01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:34.979
Does it have
something to do with this?

857
01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:36.446
What's on this land?

858
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:43.821
Unless you have a warrant, you
are trespassing on our property.

859
01:08:45.023 --> 01:08:47.959
You don't want my help. Fine.

860
01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.029
Let the bank have it!

861
01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:52.796
That's it.

862
01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:18.721
It's okay, Mom.

863
01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.359
I can't do this anymore.

864
01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.461
No, he's just
trying to scare you.

865
01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.662
I think we have to sell.

866
01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:29.100
No, no, no.
If Daddy were here...

867
01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:30.767
But he's not.

868
01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:34.738
He's not.

869
01:09:38.376 --> 01:09:39.944
I'm sorry.

870
01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:42.846
- Use Daddy's life insurance to pay for the farm.
- No.

871
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:46.117
Daddy wanted you
to follow your dreams.

872
01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:48.118
This farm is my dream!

873
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.220
Alex.

874
01:09:53.124 --> 01:09:54.124
Come on.

875
01:09:58.628 --> 01:09:59.964
Come on.

876
01:10:00.497 --> 01:10:02.542
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

877
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.938
Um, hi, CJ. It's me, Alex.

878
01:10:08.439 --> 01:10:10.074
If you can,

879
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.077
we really need you to come back.
Like, now.

880
01:10:26.124 --> 01:10:27.225
Come on, girl.

881
01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.894
Alex?

882
01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:13.737
Alex?

883
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.180
Alex!

884
01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.253
Where are you?

885
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.760
Hello?

886
01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:46.364
Hello?

887
01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:50.868
What?

888
01:12:55.273 --> 01:12:56.440
Missing?

889
01:12:58.643 --> 01:13:01.879
<i>I'm gonna handle this
once and for all.</i>

890
01:13:16.127 --> 01:13:17.794
What'd you do with her?

891
01:13:17.929 --> 01:13:19.130
Well, hey there, Monty.

892
01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:21.566
Lose one of your balls again?

893
01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:22.934
Where's Alex?

894
01:13:23.568 --> 01:13:27.205
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

895
01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:29.040
Hey!

896
01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:33.844
Have you gone crazy?

897
01:13:36.147 --> 01:13:38.049
I'm on to you, Danforth.

898
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:41.519
You're trying
to steal my son's land.

899
01:13:41.953 --> 01:13:45.890
Steal? No. Buy? You betcha.

900
01:13:46.324 --> 01:13:49.393
I'm gonna buy your son's land,
Monty Sanders.

901
01:13:49.527 --> 01:13:51.761
There ain't nothin'
you're gonna do about it.

902
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:54.165
Next one ain't gonna miss.

903
01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:56.367
Hey!

904
01:13:57.501 --> 01:13:58.669
Where's my granddaughter?

905
01:13:59.136 --> 01:14:00.881
I don't know where
your little troublemaker is,

906
01:14:00.905 --> 01:14:02.506
but I will tell you this.

907
01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:06.711
I do not appreciate
being accused

908
01:14:07.345 --> 01:14:10.848
by the man
that double crossed my daddy.

909
01:14:10.982 --> 01:14:13.084
Your old man
lost that farm to the bank,

910
01:14:13.217 --> 01:14:15.086
and I bought it fair and square.

911
01:14:15.219 --> 01:14:17.088
Go along before I lose my cool.

912
01:14:18.256 --> 01:14:21.959
Why don't you go tee off,
on the highway?

913
01:14:23.127 --> 01:14:25.795
You're gonna get
your dirty hands on that farm

914
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:27.865
over my dead body!

915
01:14:39.744 --> 01:14:41.212
Oh, God.

916
01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:55.726
Shoot.

917
01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.528
This is Sheriff Danforth.

918
01:14:57.662 --> 01:15:00.364
I need an ambulance
up at the station ASAP.

919
01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:10.975
We'll establish perimeter within
five miles of the Sanders' place.

920
01:15:11.108 --> 01:15:12.243
I'll put a call into county.

921
01:15:12.677 --> 01:15:14.979
Ask for more backup.

922
01:15:18.215 --> 01:15:20.251
- Any news?
- Not yet.

923
01:15:20.384 --> 01:15:22.053
But I got every unit on it.

924
01:15:22.186 --> 01:15:24.622
Any idea where she might be?
Where she'd run off to?

925
01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:27.525
She has never gone out at night
like that before.

926
01:15:27.658 --> 01:15:29.994
You don't think
someone took her, do you?

927
01:15:30.695 --> 01:15:31.962
No. No.

928
01:15:32.096 --> 01:15:33.397
Don't worry.

929
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:34.799
We'll find her.

930
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:40.371
Hello?

931
01:15:41.305 --> 01:15:43.974
Okay. I'll be right there.

932
01:15:45.743 --> 01:15:47.745
I gotta go.
Something's wrong with Monty.

933
01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:49.180
No.

934
01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.880
Kate.

935
01:15:51.349 --> 01:15:54.919
I want you to know, I'm sorry.

936
01:15:56.721 --> 01:15:58.089
About everything.

937
01:17:37.555 --> 01:17:40.458
What do you think, doc?
He's, he's gonna be okay, right?

938
01:17:41.192 --> 01:17:43.027
He didn't wanna
go to the hospital.

939
01:17:43.794 --> 01:17:44.930
Don't worry, Kate.

940
01:17:45.062 --> 01:17:46.597
I've called Atlanta General.

941
01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:48.599
Set him up an EKG for tomorrow.

942
01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:50.367
I ain't going nowhere.

943
01:17:50.801 --> 01:17:52.369
It's just to be safe, Monty.

944
01:17:52.503 --> 01:17:54.806
Crack of dawn,
I'll be on the tee box tomorrow.

945
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.642
You know I hit a hole in one
on the 7th back in '92.

946
01:17:58.776 --> 01:18:01.245
We know, Dad. We know.

947
01:18:01.913 --> 01:18:04.850
Alex, where is she?

948
01:18:05.349 --> 01:18:06.984
They haven't found her yet.

949
01:18:08.854 --> 01:18:10.688
We will.

950
01:18:12.223 --> 01:18:13.224
Hey, y'all.

951
01:18:13.657 --> 01:18:17.194
I'm sorry, the, uh,
front door was unlocked.

952
01:18:18.462 --> 01:18:20.631
You know, you gotta watch that.

953
01:18:21.165 --> 01:18:22.266
Doc.

954
01:18:24.502 --> 01:18:26.770
What in the hell
are you doing here, Danforth?

955
01:18:26.905 --> 01:18:31.675
Just came by to let y'all know
that I have a full tilt search going on.

956
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.277
I give you my word,

957
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.547
we're gonna find your...
your sweet,

958
01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:38.749
s... sweet little, uh...

959
01:18:38.884 --> 01:18:40.751
Alex, you idiot.

960
01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:43.621
How is Jack Nicklaus doing?

961
01:18:44.622 --> 01:18:47.691
You got some nerve
showing up in this house.

962
01:18:47.826 --> 01:18:50.127
Easy there, Tiger... Woods.

963
01:18:50.862 --> 01:18:52.663
I could arrest you
right now for assault.

964
01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:53.965
With a deadly weapon.

965
01:18:54.098 --> 01:18:55.834
You're lucky
I didn't finish the job.

966
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.301
Well.

967
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:00.671
Now look,

968
01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:03.507
I just think this whole thing
has gotten out of hand.

969
01:19:03.641 --> 01:19:05.977
And I think that all of us
need to find a way

970
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.778
to be civil with one another.

971
01:19:07.913 --> 01:19:10.381
That's why
I've decided to up my offer.

972
01:19:11.649 --> 01:19:12.649
Five percent.

973
01:19:12.716 --> 01:19:15.419
She ain't
signing nothing, Danforth.

974
01:19:15.854 --> 01:19:16.854
Kate?

975
01:19:17.488 --> 01:19:20.157
I am trying to get you out
of a pinch here.

976
01:19:21.358 --> 01:19:23.895
Now, I don't need
to remind you all

977
01:19:24.029 --> 01:19:26.297
what's gonna happen on Friday
with the bank.

978
01:19:27.698 --> 01:19:28.699
Don't do it, Kate.

979
01:19:29.166 --> 01:19:31.101
Signature page is right there.

980
01:19:33.504 --> 01:19:35.205
You're running out
of runway, darling.

981
01:19:35.339 --> 01:19:37.408
Don't do it.

982
01:19:47.953 --> 01:19:49.486
I'm gonna need a pen.

983
01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.555
A pen.

984
01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:55.259
Don't do it, Kate.

985
01:19:55.827 --> 01:19:56.827
Pen?

986
01:20:01.231 --> 01:20:03.133
What you doing here,
soldier boy?

987
01:20:03.767 --> 01:20:06.236
Shouldn't you be out protecting
the country somewhere?

988
01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:07.605
That somewhere is here.

989
01:20:09.007 --> 01:20:10.075
Don't sign anything.

990
01:20:10.207 --> 01:20:11.442
Listen to him, Kate.

991
01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:14.980
We're gonna do everything
in our power to save that farm.

992
01:20:15.412 --> 01:20:17.314
This is your last chance.

993
01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:22.586
Go home, Sheriff.
Show some respect.

994
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:33.564
Have it your way.

995
01:20:34.298 --> 01:20:35.799
Get out of here.

996
01:20:38.202 --> 01:20:39.303
I'll tell you this.

997
01:20:39.436 --> 01:20:41.338
That farm is mine.

998
01:20:47.879 --> 01:20:49.179
Oh. You.

999
01:20:57.956 --> 01:20:59.189
Alex is missing.

1000
01:21:00.859 --> 01:21:02.159
Dakota?

1001
01:21:02.894 --> 01:21:04.261
Gone, too.

1002
01:21:05.329 --> 01:21:06.530
Well, good.

1003
01:21:07.364 --> 01:21:10.167
If Dakota is with Alex,
then she is safe.

1004
01:21:10.835 --> 01:21:12.503
You got that right.

1005
01:21:12.904 --> 01:21:14.471
She's with a Marine.

1006
01:21:16.607 --> 01:21:17.741
Oorah.

1007
01:21:18.308 --> 01:21:19.543
Oorah.

1008
01:21:21.311 --> 01:21:23.547
I can't believe you're here.

1009
01:21:23.982 --> 01:21:25.783
Let, let's go look for her.

1010
01:21:26.283 --> 01:21:27.819
Dad, we'll be back, okay?

1011
01:21:29.553 --> 01:21:30.621
Come on.

1012
01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:38.429
Come on. Where is it?

1013
01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:45.269
Dad always said,
"Alex will mark the spot."

1014
01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:46.737
Come on, Dakota!

1015
01:22:30.314 --> 01:22:31.782
Dang chickens.

1016
01:22:47.598 --> 01:22:49.000
No one's seen her.

1017
01:22:53.238 --> 01:22:54.839
Any place
we haven't covered yet?

1018
01:22:55.506 --> 01:22:57.508
The only place I can think of
is the farm.

1019
01:22:59.043 --> 01:23:00.377
What now?

1020
01:23:02.513 --> 01:23:03.815
Fire Chief.

1021
01:23:07.118 --> 01:23:09.888
Wait. Are you sure?

1022
01:23:11.823 --> 01:23:12.823
Okay.

1023
01:23:14.192 --> 01:23:15.592
Get us to the fire station.

1024
01:23:16.426 --> 01:23:17.628
What's wrong?

1025
01:23:18.997 --> 01:23:20.031
It's the farm.

1026
01:23:39.117 --> 01:23:41.351
Should have
listened to me, Kate.

1027
01:23:42.253 --> 01:23:43.754
You should've listened to me.

1028
01:23:48.592 --> 01:23:50.727
What you got, girl?

1029
01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:54.765
Another one.

1030
01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:02.439
That's it. You found it!

1031
01:24:03.241 --> 01:24:04.675
Good girl.

1032
01:24:09.047 --> 01:24:10.114
Good girl.

1033
01:24:12.616 --> 01:24:14.418
Must be another treasure map.

1034
01:24:20.325 --> 01:24:22.093
"Alex, if you found this box,

1035
01:24:22.227 --> 01:24:24.896
that means you were searching
for something special."

1036
01:24:30.634 --> 01:24:34.072
"I did this to remind you that your
treasure is always here inside of you.

1037
01:24:34.205 --> 01:24:38.910
My angel, you are mine and
your mom's greatest treasure."

1038
01:25:02.934 --> 01:25:04.701
"We love you forever and ever."

1039
01:25:05.502 --> 01:25:07.338
And to the moon
and back and back.

1040
01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:11.742
"Love you always. Dad."

1041
01:25:27.158 --> 01:25:28.558
You won't listen to me.

1042
01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:55.219
You know, it doesn't
really matter where we are.

1043
01:25:59.824 --> 01:26:03.227
- Alex! Run! Your farm's on fire!
- What?

1044
01:26:10.734 --> 01:26:12.003
Hey! Kate!

1045
01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:14.005
Hey, what do you want, man?
Get out of here!

1046
01:26:14.138 --> 01:26:15.206
I want to help.

1047
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:17.474
I trust him.

1048
01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:26.918
Faster.
We're taking the shortcut.

1049
01:26:27.819 --> 01:26:29.821
Dakota, wait for me! Stop!

1050
01:26:31.755 --> 01:26:33.257
Meet you at your house!

1051
01:26:45.136 --> 01:26:46.136
Hey, little girl.

1052
01:26:48.206 --> 01:26:50.408
There's some bad guys out here.

1053
01:26:51.075 --> 01:26:53.144
I think they're trying
to burn down your farm.

1054
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.448
Why don't you go on home?

1055
01:26:57.581 --> 01:26:59.649
And, uh, they went this way.

1056
01:26:59.783 --> 01:27:02.820
So, I'm gonna go get 'em.

1057
01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:05.456
Go get him, Dakota!

1058
01:27:07.624 --> 01:27:08.692
Get him!

1059
01:27:11.062 --> 01:27:13.164
Help! Help!

1060
01:27:14.731 --> 01:27:16.800
- Who called it in?
- The neighbors.

1061
01:27:16.934 --> 01:27:18.202
Hey!

1062
01:27:20.004 --> 01:27:22.106
Dad! It's Uncle Jack!

1063
01:27:22.907 --> 01:27:26.844
Hey! Somebody get this fleabag
off of me!

1064
01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:29.679
Cursed dog!

1065
01:27:31.282 --> 01:27:32.282
Go on!

1066
01:27:36.521 --> 01:27:37.521
Arrest this animal!

1067
01:27:37.587 --> 01:27:39.057
It's a dangerous animal!

1068
01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:42.692
Oh, I'm gonna sue you.

1069
01:27:42.827 --> 01:27:44.429
And I am gonna take this farm.

1070
01:27:44.561 --> 01:27:46.596
You'll never take this farm.

1071
01:27:47.832 --> 01:27:49.000
What is that?

1072
01:27:51.302 --> 01:27:53.438
That's a good question,
soldier boy.

1073
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:55.506
There is a fire starter in town.

1074
01:27:55.639 --> 01:27:56.908
Set the can down, Jack.

1075
01:27:59.277 --> 01:28:00.277
What'd you say to me?

1076
01:28:01.879 --> 01:28:03.014
Say that again.

1077
01:28:07.452 --> 01:28:08.453
Dakota?

1078
01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:11.055
There's gas everywhere!

1079
01:28:15.293 --> 01:28:16.293
No!

1080
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.929
Dakota!

1081
01:28:48.725 --> 01:28:51.661
Alex.

1082
01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:53.763
Dakota.

1083
01:28:54.265 --> 01:28:55.266
Good girl.

1084
01:28:55.732 --> 01:28:57.235
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1085
01:28:57.368 --> 01:28:59.570
- Come on.
- Come here. Come here.

1086
01:28:59.703 --> 01:29:01.072
- All right.
- Oh.

1087
01:29:01.205 --> 01:29:02.306
Hey, old friend.

1088
01:29:05.243 --> 01:29:06.978
You got the right
to remain silent.

1089
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:09.046
You got the right
to shut up, Mike.

1090
01:29:09.713 --> 01:29:11.048
Just wait till we get home.

1091
01:29:11.648 --> 01:29:12.950
We ain't going home.

1092
01:29:13.084 --> 01:29:14.924
CJ, you made it.
You're not gonna be in trouble

1093
01:29:15.052 --> 01:29:16.487
with the Marines, are you?

1094
01:29:16.621 --> 01:29:19.824
No, the sergeant approved this
as a top-secret mission.

1095
01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:21.993
Operation LNDB.

1096
01:29:22.126 --> 01:29:23.161
LNDB?

1097
01:29:23.693 --> 01:29:24.794
Leave No Dog Behind.

1098
01:29:42.712 --> 01:29:44.215
Last chance, Mike.

1099
01:29:46.284 --> 01:29:48.286
Sure you want
to throw it all away?

1100
01:29:51.788 --> 01:29:53.024
Wow.

1101
01:30:03.935 --> 01:30:05.169
I'm so proud of you.

1102
01:30:08.705 --> 01:30:10.374
You're a hero!

1103
01:30:27.692 --> 01:30:29.493
Dakota dug a bunch of these up.

1104
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:32.430
What you and Alex got

1105
01:30:34.465 --> 01:30:36.000
is a diamond farm.

1106
01:30:37.335 --> 01:30:38.335
What?

1107
01:30:41.906 --> 01:30:43.140
Dad always said...

1108
01:30:43.641 --> 01:30:46.010
"The land will provide!"

1109
01:30:49.213 --> 01:30:52.216
Good girl. Good girl.
