(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1235
00:56:27.755 --> 00:56:28.789
You know, Nick,

1236
00:56:28.823 --> 00:56:30.157
I think a kidnapping

1237
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:32.960
could give this movie
a wider appeal.

1238
00:56:32.994 --> 00:56:34.562
I mean, it's pretty hard

1239
00:56:34.595 --> 00:56:36.496
to find an audience
these days, right?

1240
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.866
Unless you're a marvel movie,
<i>star wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

1241
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.210
Yeah, doesn't sound like
this is that.

1242
00:56:40.234 --> 00:56:41.702
No, Vivian, it isn't.

1243
00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:43.871
This is an intelligent film
for grown-ups.

VIVIAN: Now, personally,

1245
00:56:45.573 --> 00:56:49.543
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

1246
00:56:49.577 --> 00:56:52.113
about real life, real people.

1247
00:56:52.146 --> 00:56:53.748
But the reality is,

1248
00:56:53.781 --> 00:56:56.517
most people need a bit of a hook

1249
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:57.885
to get 'em into the theater.

1250
00:56:57.919 --> 00:56:59.587
Okay, now you're talking
about marketing.

1251
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.155
And if you're talking
about marketing,

1252
00:57:01.188 --> 00:57:03.925
then, yes, you do need a hook
to get them into the theater.

1253
00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:05.993
Well, get 'em
into the theater. Come on.

1254
00:57:06.027 --> 00:57:08.428
All you need
is a trailer moment.

Hold on, hold on.
Your daughter gets kidnapped?

1257
00:57:16.604 --> 00:57:18.005
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

1258
00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:19.540
Hey, am I doing this right?

1259
00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:20.951
'Cause I had that thing
in my sights.

1260
00:57:20.975 --> 00:57:22.043
But who kidnaps her?

1261
00:57:22.076 --> 00:57:23.544
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

1262
00:57:23.577 --> 00:57:24.588
The barrel
is definitely not warped.

1263
00:57:24.612 --> 00:57:25.613
Who kidnaps her?

1264
00:57:26.247 --> 00:57:27.615
Bad guys.

1265
00:57:28.616 --> 00:57:29.817
We both put our lives

1266
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:30.961
on the line to save the daughter

1267
00:57:30.985 --> 00:57:32.129
and become better men for it.

1268
00:57:32.153 --> 00:57:33.721
It's classic.

1269
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:34.798
It feels like a completely
different movie.

1270
00:57:34.822 --> 00:57:36.157
Javi, please.

1271
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:37.925
Just walk down the road
with me on this.

1272
00:57:37.959 --> 00:57:39.627
And then what?

1273
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.730
The finale is about two men
saving the girl?

1274
00:57:42.763 --> 00:57:44.098
That's terrible.

1275
00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:45.599

the key to shooting well?

1278

your breath, Nick?

1280

If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

unresolved issues with you

that it is beginning to bleed
into the work

he has so many regrets.

one to add to the list.

We were panicking

1364

because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

1365

after this bullshit.

a dead cat. That's great.

01:01:12.406 --> 01:01:14.208
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

was never able

1371

to get rid of the smell.

1375
01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.219

what he has to say.

Don't you think
that's a good idea, Nick?

1377

Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1378
01:01:33.494 --> 01:01:36.830
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

1379
01:01:38.966 --> 01:01:40.167
Great.

1380
01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:41.902

Yeah, well... that's...

1383
01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:48.809
What'd you expect?

1384
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.913
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

1385
01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:56.850
I think I should have been
more present

1386
01:01:56.884 --> 01:01:58.986
while I was at home.

1387
01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:03.357

to be focused on my work.

My face in a script.

1389
01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:11.065
But here's what
I keep coming back to.

1390
01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:14.335
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

1391
01:02:14.368 --> 01:02:16.070
from living my artistic dreams?

1392
01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:18.839
Because I sure know
I wouldn't have wanted that

1393
01:02:18.872 --> 01:02:20.307
for either of you.

we did have together?

across the desert.
