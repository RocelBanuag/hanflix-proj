1
00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:48.249
And God saw that the wickedness

2
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.779
of man was great in the earth.

3
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.279
And that every imagination

4
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.213
of the thoughts in his heart
was only evil continually.

5
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.720
And it repented the Lord that
he had made man on the earth

6
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.830
and it grieved his heart.

7
00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:13.727
And the Lord said, "I will destroy a man"

8
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.891
that I have created on
the face of the earth.

9
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.397
"For it repenteth me that I have made them."

10
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.293
Book of Genesis 6:5-7.

11
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.040
That's enough.

12
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.814
I said, that's enough.

13
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.943
I apologize, Gideon.

14
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.890
If manners maketh man, I have
surrounded myself with boys.

15
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.335
You look like you could use a drink.

16
00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:42.563
Hey.

17
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:46.936
Do you know who I am?

18
00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:47.937
Uh-huh.

19
00:04:49.092 --> 00:04:50.542
Then you know why I'm here.

20
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.153
Your tears, they do you credit.

21
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.613
They show contrition.

22
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.630
And I have no doubt that
God will forgive you

23
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.750
through the blood of his Son.

24
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.363
But I ain't God.

25
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.697
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

26
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.410
Ooh!

27
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:26.490
Pick him up!

28
00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:32.959
Hell, son. Live in it.

29
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.007
It's coming, sweet girl. It's coming.

30
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680
Sh.

31
00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:17.039
Rise and shine

32
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.980
Coffee.

33
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.330
Yep, yep, yep.

34
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:11.949
Ready?

35
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.912
What's going on. What wrong?

36
00:11:09.913 --> 00:11:11.413
Hm, want your bed?

37
00:11:12.258 --> 00:11:13.425
Be calm. Okay?

38
00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:40.195
Sh, sh.

39
00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.587
Sh, sh! It's okay.

40
00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:58.185
It's all right. It's all right.

41
00:12:10.609 --> 00:12:12.199
Give me that.

42
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.529
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

43
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.059
Amen.
Amen.

44
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.919
You go hunt down that damn coyote,

45
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.920
before we lose any more of our chickens.

46
00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:33.107
Uh, Pa?

47
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.220
Can I come hunt with you?

48
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.739
Ask your ma.

49
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.453
Well, can I?

50
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.580
Can I?

51
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.690
If you finish your chores.

52
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.435
Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess.

53
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.132
What's this?

54
00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:13.783
Ma gave it to me.

55
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.349
She said you shot a red
major clean off his horse

56
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.643
at 700 yards.

57
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.803
I think she said

58
00:13:22.804 --> 00:13:25.123
I could shoot a red major
off his horse 700 yards.

59
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.110
I can't.

60
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.850
Nobody can.

61
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.739
But you did kill kill Rebs.

62
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.773
It ain't polite conversation, son.

63
00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:39.427
You were a sharp shooter?

64
00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:41.139
I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

65
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.633
Don't you ever forget it. Goodnight.

66
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.053
Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

67
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.739
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy

68
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.140
and read books in the
back of your daddy's store

69
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.419
that someday we'd be
homesteading this wild country

70
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.520
with the best of them.

71
00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.221
Are we gonna make it out here?

72
00:14:26.222 --> 00:14:27.783
Just gotta have a little grit.

73
00:14:28.896 --> 00:14:31.033
I don't know where to find that anymore.

74
00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:34.239
Sure you do.

75
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240
I know.

76
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.337
Deep down, you're the toughest
woman in this territory.

77
00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:16.123
Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

78
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.680
Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

79
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.260
Good Lord, Hat. What the hell happened?

80
00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:32.236
Ma?

81
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.983
Boy's down. Supper's put away.

82
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.449
I'm sorry.

83
00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.283
They must have wandered

84
00:19:59.284 --> 00:20:01.419
off the reservation looking for something.

85
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.420
Got no scrap.

86
00:20:10.221 --> 00:20:14.782
I want to go home.

87
00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:16.963
All right, if you wanna see your folks,

88
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.499
reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

89
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.500
Buy you a ticket.

90
00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:23.501
I don't want a ticket.

91
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.489
I want to pack the wagon
and take our children out

92
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.603
of this God forsaken place.

93
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.719
I know it's been hard,
but this here's good land.

94
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.163
We live in a shack, Jeb.

95
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.509
We've got old tools, worn out live stock,

96
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.559
and can only feed our children

97
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.360
with food borrowed off store credit.

98
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.833
I understand it's been tough.

99
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.689
But this is our dream, Hattie.

100
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.759
This is what we set out to do,

101
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.810
build a home on land we can call our own.

102
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.430
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

103
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.289
You want us to crawl back to him?

104
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.969
We can't make it on our own.

105
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.420
Hell, yes, we can. We
just gotta keep on going.

106
00:21:11.517 --> 00:21:12.850
Well, I can't.

107
00:21:26.242 --> 00:21:27.909
That's good.

108
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.459
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

109
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.293
Be a strong boy.

110
00:21:37.294 --> 00:21:40.417
Look after your mom while
I'm in town, won't ya?

111
00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:54.905
Here, Pa.

112
00:22:16.203 --> 00:22:20.910
Jeb.
Hiyah, go!

113
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.759
I think we've earned it.

114
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.443
Pa says candy's a real treat,

115
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.563
just for Christmas and funerals.

116
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.309
When I was a girl in St. Louis,

117
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.723
we'd have candy every week.

118
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.939
Really?

119
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.799
We'd have ice cream in the summer,

120
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.059
toffee in the fall and
peppermint sticks at Christmas.

121
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.660
You would've loved living there.

122
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.359
Is it true that Granny
and Gramps didn't want you

123
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360
to marry Pa?

124
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.959
They just had their own ideas

125
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.029
about what they wanted for me.

126
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.229
But PA's a hero. He defended
Missouri from the Rebs.

127
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.557
Your pa was a Reb.

128
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.900
He used it to be join up to save the Union.

129
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.030
Things weren't simple back then.

130
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.140
Will.

131
00:24:19.523 --> 00:24:21.669
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

132
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.319
And to you.

133
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.403
I wonder if we might trouble
you for some of your water.

134
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.019
Our mounts are about dried
out and we're not much better.

135
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.370
Take as much as you like.

136
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.773
Much obliged.

137
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.990
Will.

138
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.809
What's the matter with you, son.

139
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.660
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

140
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.139
You didn't have no ma,
dropped out of a whore

141
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.672
and raised by those fur
traders, is what I heard.

142
00:25:12.923 --> 00:25:14.473
I do apologize, ma'am.

143
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.799
We have been in the saddle
for about three months now

144
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.559
and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

145
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.159
Um, I couldn't help, but
notice your coop over yonder,

146
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.249
I, I wonder if I might
offer to buy some salt pork

147
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.409
and maybe a dozen eggs.

148
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.810
Fetch as many as you need.

149
00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:34.952
Well.

150
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:37.830
I must confess,

151
00:25:37.831 --> 00:25:41.023
I, I do feel a bit forward
talking business with a lady.

152
00:25:41.956 --> 00:25:43.753
Uh, is your husband at home?

153
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.983
He ain't here. He gone to town.

154
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.909
Oh, well then I guess
that makes you the man

155
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.060
of the house, I reckon.

156
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.503
Oh, uh, one more thing.

157
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.429
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

158
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.689
St. Louis.

159
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.139
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

160
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.769
I am a Cameron man, myself,
that big fella over there,

161
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.418
he's from Arkansas, but we try
not to hold that against it.

162
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.139
We don't get many Missourians out this way.

163
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.793
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

164
00:26:40.084 --> 00:26:45.084
I'd be happy to cook you men
some breakfast before you go.

165
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.483
Well, we would be much obliged.

166
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.580
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

167
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.989
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

168
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.519
McAllister.
McAllister.

169
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.493
Hattie. This is Bess and this is Will.

170
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480
Set the table.

171
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.749
How old are you?

172
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.849
Nine and three quarters.

173
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.453
Why then, I reckon that's big
enough to wear one of these.

174
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.139
This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs.
McAllister.

175
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.643
Your husband is a lucky man.

176
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.599
She wants to talk.

177
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.463
Oh, now here, allow me.

178
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.830
I've held a baby at two in my life.

179
00:28:05.171 --> 00:28:07.569
Yeah. You okay?

180
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.570
Yeah.

181
00:28:15.837 --> 00:28:20.007
Now Dixie forever

182
00:28:20.008 --> 00:28:22.838
She's never at a loss

183
00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:25.008
Down with the eagle

184
00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:27.998
Up with the cross.

185
00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:30.306
We will rally around the flag, boys

186
00:28:30.307 --> 00:28:33.755
We'll rally 'round again

187
00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:36.916
Shout, shout the battle cry of

188
00:28:36.917 --> 00:28:38.858
Freedom

189
00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:46.026
Now Dixie forever

190
00:28:46.027 --> 00:28:48.483
She's never had a loss

191
00:28:48.484 --> 00:28:49.658
Bess.

192
00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:52.421
Down with the eagle

193
00:28:52.422 --> 00:28:53.589
And up with the cross

194
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.995
Gonna go fetch some eggs.

195
00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:57.268
We will rally round the flag, boys

196
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:59.259
We'll rally 'round again

197
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.260
Yeah. Come on.

198
00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:02.548
Shout shout

199
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:05.026
The battle cry of freedom

200
00:29:05.027 --> 00:29:06.519
Hey, Hey. Hey.

201
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.633
Is that a Reb song?

202
00:29:19.236 --> 00:29:21.879
Need to teach her that song.

203
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.249
You never heard that song before.

204
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.333
You like that song?

205
00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:18.030
Happy girl now, doo, doo

206
00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:24.147
What a gentle little soul she is.

207
00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:30.763
You ain' got a problem
with Rebs, now do you, boy.

208
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.449
Our young host was born
after hostilities ended.

209
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.243
I'm sure he's a proud
American, aren't you, boy.

210
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.789
Nothing wrong with that,

211
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.699
man should be loyal to his own country.

212
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.700
Not everybody is.

213
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.859
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

214
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.860
Was he now?

215
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.749
Will's not a bad shot himself.

216
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.129
Why don't you go show these gentlemen

217
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.080
that shotgun your daddy got you.

218
00:31:09.077 --> 00:31:10.899
Easy now.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

219
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.183
Let me see that.

220
00:31:13.107 --> 00:31:14.457
Oh my goodness.

221
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.316
Those Rebs best be careful
coming around here.

222
00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:26.317
Oh.

223
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.460
Will, warm up the coffee.

224
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.599
Hope you like strawberry jam.

225
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.399
That's all we could grow this spring.

226
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.383
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

227
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.353
Before we dig in, boys, we
like to have a little prayer.

228
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.633
Keep us humble.

229
00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.730
Lord,

230
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.609
please look down on us
and help us to be grateful

231
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.069
for these gifts that we have been given

232
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.889
and help us to be always mindful

233
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.119
of the needs of others and
not think only of ourselves.

234
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.479
We pray in the name of
your son, Jesus Christ.

235
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.609
Amen.
Amen.

236
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.551
All right.

237
00:32:19.552 --> 00:32:22.812
Ma!

238
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.563
Will, get behind the stove
with your sister. Now!

239
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.023
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

240
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.153
How have we offended?

241
00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.733
I don't feed killers in my house.

242
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840
Killers.

243
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.433
Good Lord.

244
00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:00.249
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

245
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.769
Boy, she is talking about those trophies

246
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.803
that we got off that Cheyenne
trader near Fort Laramie.

247
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.789
Ma'am, I realize that's
an unseemly business,

248
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.769
but those can be very valuable objects

249
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.259
when you're trading in the back country.

250
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.780
Now can't we just sit back down

251
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.929
and talk about something more pleasant.

252
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.613
We were having such a nice time.

253
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.423
I think it's best you go now.

254
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.129
What the hell are we waiting for?

255
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.993
She's only got two rounds.

256
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.539
As you wish.

257
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.033
And leave your guns.

258
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.260
The hell we will.

259
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.089
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand

260
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.803
how valuable these weapons are.

261
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.583
You can trade your
scalps for some new ones.

262
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.840
You heard the woman.

263
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.719
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

264
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.973
They took him off his
dead body of Pea Ridge.

265
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380
Fine.

266
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.353
Can I have my hat?

267
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.100
Will, give him his hat.

268
00:35:30.393 --> 00:35:31.893
Hiyah!

269
00:36:06.303 --> 00:36:07.303
Help me.

270
00:36:16.468 --> 00:36:17.468
Push! Push!

271
00:36:52.885 --> 00:36:56.104
Son of a bitch!

272
00:36:56.937 --> 00:36:58.020
Ah, get down!

273
00:37:06.905 --> 00:37:07.905
Wait a sec! Come and see!

274
00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:12.975
Come and see!

275
00:37:12.976 --> 00:37:17.976
Son of a bitch!

276
00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:21.247
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

277
00:38:21.248 --> 00:38:22.665
I want 'em alive!

278
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.703
Whoo! She can't shoot for jack shit.

279
00:38:34.344 --> 00:38:36.505
I need you to be brave. Okay?

280
00:38:36.506 --> 00:38:37.506
Okay.

281
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.260
Reload.

282
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.370
Take care of your sister.

283
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.513
Just take what you want and go.

284
00:41:21.027 --> 00:41:24.443
But what we want is you.

285
00:41:37.403 --> 00:41:39.009
I can do anything.

286
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.403
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

287
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.999
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

288
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.919
There simply isn't the work.

289
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.439
We have more than enough
men to meet our needs.

290
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.819
There has to be something.

291
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.009
I could even help with the chuck wagons.

292
00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.349
Oh Lord, we're not cowboys.

293
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.600
We just bring our food
up from down the line.

294
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.110
Good day. Best of luck.

295
00:42:27.856 --> 00:42:31.106
You're all right. It's okay.

296
00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:33.637
Here we go.

297
00:42:35.724 --> 00:42:36.724
Okay. Okay.

298
00:42:40.569 --> 00:42:43.011
Mrs. McAllister.

299
00:42:53.555 --> 00:42:55.138
Hide your sister.

300
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.783
Mrs. McAllister.
That's far enough.

301
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.220
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

302
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.443
I would like for us to
start over, make it right.

303
00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.969
There's nothing to talk about,

304
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.883
except you men getting on
your horses and riding off.

305
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.343
I respect how you must be
feeling and I can sympathize,

306
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.433
but this standoff not doing
anybody a lick of good.

307
00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.729
It's true that I've
done my share of killing

308
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.413
both during the war and after.

309
00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.743
But one thing I ain't never done,

310
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.373
I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

311
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.280
Why should I believe a word you say.

312
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.683
I had a daughter once.

313
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.473
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

314
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.869
Every bit of love and
affection a father can give

315
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.493
I lavished on that child.

316
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.373
She's dead now.

317
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.213
Buried out Cameron way.

318
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.753
I swear on her grave,

319
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.829
I will not harm a hair on your head

320
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.480
or on the heads of your children.

321
00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:05.090
Dammit!

322
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.190
Damn fools!

323
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.540
You okay? You okay?

324
00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.005
I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

325
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:57.532
That's all right.

326
00:45:57.533 --> 00:45:58.853
Bring her here.

327
00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:30.937
Come on, Bess.

328
00:46:38.023 --> 00:46:39.703
What are they doing with Daisy?

329
00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:48.890
No.

330
00:46:51.305 --> 00:46:52.305
No!

331
00:46:54.804 --> 00:46:56.103
No.

332
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:25.313
Sorry.

333
00:47:31.968 --> 00:47:32.801
Now, you hold him.

334
00:47:32.802 --> 00:47:36.014
Oh, hell, Captain, it'll heal itself.

335
00:47:36.015 --> 00:47:37.950
It'll heal on its own, Captain.

336
00:47:37.951 --> 00:47:40.059
It'll heal on its own.

337
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.605
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

338
00:47:42.606 --> 00:47:45.783
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

339
00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:47.008
Open his sleeve.

340
00:47:47.009 --> 00:47:51.708
Damn them all to hell!

341
00:47:51.709 --> 00:47:55.584
Well I reckon that all the
sufferings of this present age

342
00:47:55.585 --> 00:47:57.513
are not worthy compared to the glory,

343
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:01.881
which shall be revealed in us.

344
00:48:06.571 --> 00:48:09.105
It's gonna be all right.

345
00:48:09.106 --> 00:48:13.329
Pa couldn't have been Reb,
Ma, just couldn't have been.

346
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.980
That's what you're upset about?

347
00:48:17.648 --> 00:48:20.833
Your Pa's no Rebel.

348
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.379
He may have begun fighting for the South,

349
00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.233
but he ended that war a patriot.

350
00:48:29.115 --> 00:48:30.784
But you said that he was-

351
00:48:30.785 --> 00:48:32.985
Good and bad aren't always so clear, Will.

352
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.077
Sometimes you wake up

353
00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:38.079
and you realize you're on
the wrong side of things.

354
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.080
And when you pa did,

355
00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:42.159
he have the courage to make things right.

356
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.543
Just like he always does.

357
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.573
And when he comes back,

358
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.653
those killers outside are
gonna feel God's wrath.

359
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.903
What if they kill him instead?

360
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.253
Better eat up, son.

361
00:49:32.413 --> 00:49:34.693
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

362
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:43.153
Well, Captain, there's,

363
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.439
there's just something about all this

364
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.053
that I don't rightly understand.

365
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.440
Go on.

366
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.233
Well, it's all you said about
not hurting women or kids.

367
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.190
And you think we ought to stand by that.

368
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.319
You remember when your Pappy and I rode out

369
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.889
to defend our way of life
from the tyrant Lincoln.

370
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:21.890
I do.

371
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:25.730
We had a lot of fine ideas then

372
00:50:27.134 --> 00:50:29.889
about chivalry and honor

373
00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:33.373
and what war should look like.

374
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.523
How the rightness of our cause
would carry us to victory.

375
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:48.823
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

376
00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.359
They burned our farms

377
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.173
and hung our kin without cause.

378
00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:00.500
And all our fine notions were nothing

379
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.510
in the face of their
rapacious, murderous hatred.

380
00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.863
They took my only child from me,

381
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.990
ripped her from this life

382
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.423
without mercy or pity.

383
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:36.950
And there ain't no law on earth

384
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.490
or in heaven or hell

385
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:47.743
that can keep a father
from taking his revenge.

386
00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:52.310
Not the devil

387
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.803
and not God himself.

388
00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:11.610
That make things any clearer?

389
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.740
Hell, we ain't gonna have
to hurt anybody anyway.

390
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.003
How you figure that?

391
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.033
Mrs. McAllister ain't cut
out for this kinda life.

392
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.053
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

393
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:41.413
We give her enough time,

394
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.533
she's just gonna come on out here to us.

395
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.603
That's the sensible thing to do.

396
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.603
And she is a sensible woman.

397
00:52:53.604 --> 00:52:55.093
Captain!
What?

398
00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.120
The hell.

399
00:53:00.586 --> 00:53:02.419
Damnation!

400
00:53:26.705 --> 00:53:28.155
They'll see that for miles.

401
00:53:35.333 --> 00:53:36.699
Ma!

402
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.252
Keep it burning, you understand?

403
00:53:38.253 --> 00:53:39.772
Anything you can find.

404
00:54:36.201 --> 00:54:37.201
Look.

405
00:55:15.213 --> 00:55:20.213
Will, your sister.

406
00:56:01.009 --> 00:56:02.426
Come to a help.

407
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.080
The children are still inside?

408
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:10.780
You come alone, neighbor?

409
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.619
Yeah, I see the smoke,
I come riding real fast.

410
00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:15.943
Why? What's wrong.

411
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.240
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

412
00:56:23.139 --> 00:56:24.576
Get help!

413
00:56:24.577 --> 00:56:26.289
No. I want him alive.

414
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.893
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

415
00:57:16.304 --> 00:57:17.137
Let it burn!

416
00:57:17.138 --> 00:57:19.593
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

417
00:57:32.103 --> 00:57:34.201
Just trying to help.

418
00:58:52.897 --> 00:58:54.730
Let him go.

419
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.169
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

420
00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:02.653
It does not dignify a woman
to holler and carry on such.

421
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.530
He hasn't done anything to you.

422
00:59:08.169 --> 00:59:09.669
Well, that is entirely true.

423
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.729
But as you see,

424
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:16.873
your obstinance has put us
all in a difficult situation.

425
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:22.659
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here

426
00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.513
and let us resolve this
like civilized people.

427
00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:29.492
Hattie, you stay there.

428
00:59:29.493 --> 00:59:31.269
He's a no good liar.

429
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:32.270
He can't be trusted.

430
00:59:33.872 --> 00:59:36.022
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

431
00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.053
I'll have to resort to other methods.

432
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.279
You don't have to do this.

433
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.273
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

434
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.779
I was raised to believe in the Good Book.

435
00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.843
It's the only thing that
keeps us from being savages.

436
00:59:57.130 --> 01:00:00.219
But even a preacher's
boy has got his limits.

437
01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.373
Please. He has a wife and five children.

438
01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.239
The Lord is my shepherd.

439
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240
I shall not want.

440
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.359
You made me to lay down.

441
01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.249
I don't like repeating myself.

442
01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.083
He led me besides the still waters.

443
01:00:13.084 --> 01:00:17.049
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this

444
01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.223
one more time.

445
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.220
Come on out!

446
01:00:20.221 --> 01:00:22.220
In the valley of the shadow off death,

447
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.189
I will fear no evil.

448
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.217
No. No.

449
01:00:26.218 --> 01:00:28.008
For thou art with me.

450
01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:33.733
You left it across the street.

451
01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.940
See?

452
01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.359
Maybe I best come down
and escort you across.

453
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.337
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

454
01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.943
Hey. You really gonna drive
home half liquored up?

455
01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:58.059
Seems to me you ought to sober up

456
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.793
or just go on, get drunk all the way.

457
01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:04.756
I gotta get home to my farm.

458
01:03:04.757 --> 01:03:07.963
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

459
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:11.169
We got real nice beds in there.

460
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.929
Soft satin sheets.

461
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.519
Oh, you could sleep all night.

462
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.270
Wake up first thing in the morning.

463
01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.410
Of course, you can do other things too.

464
01:03:21.681 --> 01:03:23.043
My wife.

465
01:03:23.044 --> 01:03:24.483
Your wife?
She's waiting on me.

466
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.989
Something tells me your wife,

467
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:30.583
she don't appreciate you,

468
01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:37.980
hard workin' man like you,
not the way you deserve.

469
01:03:39.997 --> 01:03:43.164
Oh, geez!

470
01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:03.089
Hyah!

471
01:04:08.081 --> 01:04:10.863
I think it's time you learned
how to make some coffee.

472
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:13.440
First, put on some water.

473
01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:39.613
Now we need to grind up some beans.

474
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.973
You want 'em fine like table salt.

475
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.750
Can we boil 'em?

476
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.009
That may be how cow hands

477
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.629
make some black sludge they call coffee,

478
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:54.189
but it's not the proper way.

479
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.839
Well, what do we do different?

480
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.190
How's that grind looking?

481
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:05.979
Just like salt.

482
01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.149
Good.

483
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:09.250
Now find something we can use as a filter.

484
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.210
Now we wait for it to boil.

485
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:44.160
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

486
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.980
I was walking home from school
one day back in St. Louis.

487
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.019
It was during the war and the
streets were full of soldiers.

488
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.059
One bunch decided they
wanted to have some fun.

489
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.869
So they stole my books.

490
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.999
I begged and pleaded for
them to give 'em back.

491
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But they wouldn't.

492
01:06:06.848 --> 01:06:09.039
And just when I started to cry,

493
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.113
I heard someone order those boys to stop.

494
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.339
I turned around expecting
a lieutenant or a captain,

495
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.723
but it was just your pa.

496
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.443
He was all alone,

497
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.323
in a private's uniform no less.

498
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.309
There was one man against six,

499
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:31.299
but there was something in his voice,

500
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.769
something that said he could still lick

501
01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:36.193
every single one of them, one
at a time or all together.

502
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.269
When they heard it, one by one,

503
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.409
they started to drift away

504
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.713
till the last one, gave me
back my books and apologized.

505
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.939
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

506
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.333
I said, yes, but in my
heart, I already knew.

507
01:06:57.936 --> 01:06:58.936
Knew what?

508
01:07:03.308 --> 01:07:06.641
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

509
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.019
That nothing in this world
could ever cause him to give up

510
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.443
and whatever would come, he
would stand up and protect me.

511
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.553
All right, now pour it over
the beans, nice and slow.

512
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:47.469
How about some more rock candy?

513
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.420
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

514
01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:11.379
Will. Will!

515
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.150
I need you to keep watch.

516
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.439
I'll be right back.

517
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.783
Psst, psst!

518
01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:39.109
Ma!

519
01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520
Don't shoot.

520
01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:46.212
I just come the talk.

521
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.249
You so much as flinch

522
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.473
and I swear, I'll put a
bullet through your heart.

523
01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:54.410
I ain't armed.

524
01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.269
Right through your heart.

525
01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.270
Please.

526
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.042
The others don't know I come.

527
01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:05.093
Will you just listen?

528
01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.960
All right. Talk then.

529
01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:13.599
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

530
01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.419
We was supposed to rob banks and trains,

531
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.252
not hurt women and children.

532
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.770
It just don't sit right with me no more.

533
01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.319
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

534
01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.509
If I'd done said anything,

535
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:30.310
I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

536
01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:35.078
I remember my mama once warned me

537
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.063
about falling in with bad company.

538
01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:40.929
Once I did, I didn't realize

539
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.643
how hard it would be to part ways.

540
01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:45.943
Who are they?

541
01:09:47.411 --> 01:09:48.961
They're a gang from Missouri.

542
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.839
They rode with Quantrill's
Raiders during the war.

543
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.673
Captain was his right hand man.

544
01:09:56.350 --> 01:10:00.399
Most of the fellers gave up
when old Quantrill was killed

545
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.539
or after the surrender.

546
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.683
But not Captain.

547
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.293
The war ain't never ended for him.

548
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:12.643
Look, if if'n I help you,

549
01:10:14.094 --> 01:10:16.833
will you put in a good world
with the US Marshall for me?

550
01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:21.793
Right then, here's my plan.

551
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:26.229
The others are sleeping and
I'm supposed to be on watch.

552
01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:29.019
If you and the young ones
can get out of the window,

553
01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.539
I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

554
01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.540
I'll bring horses.

555
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:35.739
You can get 'em without waking them.

556
01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.740
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

557
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.600
I'll get the children ready.

558
01:10:47.796 --> 01:10:49.233
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

559
01:10:50.092 --> 01:10:53.568
All right.

560
01:10:53.569 --> 01:10:54.457
Thank you.

561
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.920
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser

562
01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.133
and then go find Jeb.

563
01:11:07.479 --> 01:11:09.312
Jed! Son of a bitch!

564
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:12.733
She got him, Captain.

565
01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:16.543
Now I gotta tell his mama!

566
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.649
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

567
01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:22.029
You mind your tongue.

568
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:24.343
Ma, he was just trying to help!

569
01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.143
I never told him your
pa's name, not one time.

570
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:34.830
Then how did they know it?

571
01:11:36.272 --> 01:11:37.539
They're not after us.

572
01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.040
They came looking for your pa.

573
01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.189
That's why they're out
there taking their time.

574
01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:47.439
That's why they're out there now waiting.

575
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440
We're just the bait.

576
01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.483
Your father's walking into a trap.

577
01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:56.932
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

578
01:11:56.933 --> 01:11:58.773
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

579
01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.250
I need you to get the filly.

580
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:07.862
What? No, I can't.

581
01:12:07.863 --> 01:12:09.416
Yes, you can.

582
01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:11.113
You're your father's son.

583
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.083
It's our turn to protect him.

584
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:25.910
That little Yankee bastard!

585
01:13:48.267 --> 01:13:50.205
They took that Yankee bastard

586
01:13:50.206 --> 01:13:52.632
They shot him in the head

587
01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:54.300
They put him on the fire

588
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:57.884
So if mama saw he's dead

589
01:14:03.826 --> 01:14:04.826
Sh!

590
01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.980
It's okay. It's okay.

591
01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:18.854
The Yankee's went to Baltimore

592
01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:22.522
And they came upon a mare

593
01:15:01.268 --> 01:15:03.033
Hell, Captain,

594
01:15:03.034 --> 01:15:06.564
the horses are running to kingdom come!

595
01:15:06.565 --> 01:15:09.189
You get her!

596
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.780
Oh, come on.

597
01:15:18.069 --> 01:15:22.736
Son of a bitch! Get back here.

598
01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:27.763
Will! Will!

599
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.130
Think you're going.

600
01:15:32.717 --> 01:15:36.013
You know, Captain, he didn't
mean you no harm before,

601
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.323
but he does now.

602
01:15:46.962 --> 01:15:47.962
Easy.

603
01:15:54.847 --> 01:15:56.468
No! No!

604
01:15:56.469 --> 01:16:00.475
No! No!

605
01:16:00.476 --> 01:16:03.770
You don't move. You understand me?

606
01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:05.021
Don't you move!

607
01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.357
Oh my god, my god, she got my face!

608
01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:11.816
Will, run!

609
01:16:12.725 --> 01:16:13.558
She got my face!

610
01:16:13.559 --> 01:16:16.152
God, she got my damn face!

611
01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:18.320
Will, run! Run!

612
01:18:07.776 --> 01:18:08.859
Go, run!
Ma!

613
01:18:10.802 --> 01:18:12.052
Go! Take her!

614
01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:14.727
You run, just take her.

615
01:18:14.728 --> 01:18:17.253
Go to the Danielsons. Go!

616
01:18:17.254 --> 01:18:18.752
Go! Go!

617
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.566
Come here, you!

618
01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:30.468
Come here, I got you!

619
01:18:30.469 --> 01:18:35.469
Get out of there! Let go!

620
01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.263
Where'd you go?

621
01:18:40.394 --> 01:18:42.599
Come on out, I won't hurt ya.

622
01:18:49.163 --> 01:18:50.163
Bitch!

623
01:19:10.753 --> 01:19:13.273
That was a damn fool
thing you done back there.

624
01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:16.063
Almost got yourself killed.

625
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:21.039
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

626
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.079
Captain, when we gonna go get
that little Yankee bastard?

627
01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.939
Shut your mouth.

628
01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.790
We got everything we need right here.

629
01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.969
All we gotta do is get Mrs.
McAllister back home

630
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:32.924
before she catches her death out here.

631
01:19:32.925 --> 01:19:34.119
Yeah, but you told me I could get him

632
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.349
and bring him back here and cut his-

633
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:38.000
Shut your belly achin' rotten mouth!

634
01:19:56.477 --> 01:20:00.141
You move, you die.

635
01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.069
You want to see how it feels
to get your flesh burned off?

636
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:19.393
Gentle does it, boys.

637
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:29.319
As it says in Ecclesiastes:

638
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.209
Cast thy bread upon the waters

639
01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:33.883
for thou shalt find it after many days.

640
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:55.520
Jeb!

641
01:20:57.883 --> 01:20:58.883
Care to die?

642
01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.940
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

643
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:10.753
Let her go, Miller.

644
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:13.843
It's Captain Miller to you.

645
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.300
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

646
01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:24.490
Where are my children?

647
01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.309
They're safe.

648
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:28.810
They made it across the river.

649
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.720
You still call yourself
a Confederate officer.

650
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:37.930
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

651
01:21:40.007 --> 01:21:42.579
"For a man shall leave
his father and mother"

652
01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.049
and cleave unto his wife.

653
01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:46.149
"And they shall be as one flesh."

654
01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:49.059
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

655
01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:52.149
Your sins have found you
out, Jebediah McAllister,

656
01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:54.613
and now they are visited
upon your whole family.

657
01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.640
What do you want?

658
01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:11.409
Vengeance.

659
01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:13.659
Vengeance belongs to the Lord, Miller.

660
01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.853
Well, the Lord takes too damn long.

661
01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:21.249
Now I can see that I am
being less than clear.

662
01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:22.513
So let me be blunt.

663
01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:26.979
You either put that gun down

664
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.179
or your pretty little wife

665
01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.583
is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

666
01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.823
You said you never hurt a woman.

667
01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.443
I haven't, but he has.

668
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:46.029
My daughter has laid

669
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:48.729
in her grave for 12 years,

670
01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:51.639
while her murderers have walked free.

671
01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.769
We didn't murder anyone.

672
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:54.700
It was an accident.

673
01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:55.843
She trusted you.

674
01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:00.399
She trusted you because
you were her countryman.

675
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.123
Not one man there knew she was inside.
Ask him!

676
01:23:05.217 --> 01:23:09.403
Not one man there draws breath, except you.

677
01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.993
We thought it was you in there.

678
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.943
No, only my heart.

679
01:23:28.630 --> 01:23:30.339
Make it slow.

680
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.763
Jeb!

681
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.679
You swear, you won't hurt her.
You'll let her go.

682
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.719
No, no, Jeb!

683
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.223
On my child's grave.

684
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:45.390
You can't trust him.

685
01:23:52.391 --> 01:23:53.391
No.

686
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:56.598
No, no, no, no!

687
01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.524
No, no!

688
01:24:08.107 --> 01:24:11.824
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

689
01:24:16.623 --> 01:24:19.025
Hope you don't mind, Jebediah.

690
01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:20.752
The pleasure's all mine.

691
01:24:20.753 --> 01:24:22.200
You son of a bitch!

692
01:24:26.246 --> 01:24:27.913
Come on, princess!

693
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.663
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

694
01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:53.233
Bad enough if I had to kill
men for the Confederacy,

695
01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.439
I murdered a child for the union.

696
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.240
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

697
01:25:01.278 --> 01:25:02.463
It doesn't matter to him.

698
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.029
When he finishes what he is gonna do,

699
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:10.025
you ride outta here and don't look back.

700
01:25:10.026 --> 01:25:12.609
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

701
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.520
Well. Mrs. McAllister,

702
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.673
pride goeth before a fall.

703
01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:30.150
Now, I think that you deserve
to have a front row seat

704
01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:34.599
for this trial because of
your close relationship

705
01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.923
with the accused.

706
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.013
Jebediah McAllister,

707
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:47.619
you are here by charged
with crimes against God

708
01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.783
and the Confederate States of America,

709
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.783
including a murder of a child.

710
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:57.973
How do you plead?

711
01:27:00.130 --> 01:27:01.680
I have done what I have done.

712
01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.880
You have heard the confession.

713
01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.940
Don't hit my wife!

714
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.696
Gentlemen of the jury-

715
01:27:11.697 --> 01:27:12.530
Wahoo!

716
01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:14.440
How do you find the defendant?

717
01:27:16.747 --> 01:27:21.009
Guilty as hell, Captain.

718
01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:22.033
Guilty as hell.

719
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.158
You got no right.

720
01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:34.963
Look what you have wrought, McAllister.

721
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:39.440
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

722
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:44.319
You don't give a damn what I have to say.

723
01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.032
Go on, do what you gotta do.

724
01:27:46.033 --> 01:27:47.200
No!

725
01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.387
Are you familiar with the book of Romans?

726
01:27:55.097 --> 01:27:59.647
"For all, have sinned and fallen
short of the glory of God."

727
01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.699
And I have no doubt that
God will forgive you-

728
01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:04.533
No!

729
01:28:04.534 --> 01:28:06.020
Through the blood of his Son.

730
01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.128
But I ain't God.

731
01:28:15.804 --> 01:28:17.387
I'll do anything!

732
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.580
I said, I'd do anything!

733
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:23.750
Anything?

734
01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.023
Each man here.

735
01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.733
Entirely of your own free will.

736
01:28:37.657 --> 01:28:38.657
Hattie, no.

737
01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.103
Well.
Not for me.

738
01:28:43.465 --> 01:28:45.252
Hattie, no!
What do you say?

739
01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:48.393
Hattie, no.

740
01:28:49.463 --> 01:28:51.213
Don't do it!
Woo-ie!

741
01:28:54.073 --> 01:28:55.656
Hattie, no.

742
01:28:56.814 --> 01:28:58.314
Don't do it, no!

743
01:28:59.674 --> 01:29:00.674
Hattie!

744
01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:12.579
Now I expect you to conduct yourself

745
01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.713
like a Southern gentleman in there.

746
01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.919
I am going to allow you to watch your wife,

747
01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.460
make herself into a whore

748
01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:29.990
and then I'm gonna kill ya just the same.

749
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.687
Take off your gun belt
and leave it by the door.

750
01:29:56.410 --> 01:29:58.310
I can put some perfume on if you like.

751
01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.613
I got a bottle in just
last year from New York.

752
01:30:39.377 --> 01:30:44.377
"And behold, the pale
rider which sat on him,

753
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:46.017
his name was Death."

754
01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:59.784
"And Hell followed with him."

755
01:32:47.265 --> 01:32:52.265
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

756
01:33:04.268 --> 01:33:06.601
Hey, hurry it up in there.

757
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:11.764
My pecker's getting antsy.

758
01:33:18.808 --> 01:33:23.808
Son of a bitch shot me again!

759
01:33:27.305 --> 01:33:29.949
Kill 'em all!

760
01:34:02.872 --> 01:34:05.122
I'm all right. All right.

761
01:34:21.361 --> 01:34:23.306
Where are you going?

762
01:34:35.096 --> 01:34:36.499
What are you doing?

763
01:34:48.101 --> 01:34:49.601
Go on.

764
01:35:28.944 --> 01:35:30.361
Thank you, Frank.

765
01:35:33.209 --> 01:35:34.459
You avenged her

766
01:35:36.407 --> 01:35:38.203
as if she was yours.

767
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.113
May all his glory be
revealed you, my brother.

768
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:14.353
And upon the wicked, he shall rain snares.

769
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.020
Fire!

770
01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:21.825
And brimstone!

771
01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.200
And a horrible tempest

772
01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.460
shall be the portion of their cup.

773
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.383
This is not the end, McAllister.

774
01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:48.290
You hear me?

775
01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:50.623
This is just the beginning.

776
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:56.263
The inequities of the father
will visited upon the children!

777
01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:05.410
I am gonna hunt down your girl and boy!

778
01:37:06.922 --> 01:37:11.255
I don't care how years,
I don't care how many miles!

779
01:37:12.842 --> 01:37:14.259
I will find them!

780
01:37:16.033 --> 01:37:17.033
Jeb.

781
01:37:29.715 --> 01:37:31.894
You son of a bitch!

782
01:38:13.943 --> 01:38:14.943
Hey!

783
01:38:19.077 --> 01:38:20.077
Jebediah.

784
01:38:33.325 --> 01:38:34.325
It is finished!

785
01:40:53.913 --> 01:40:57.925
Until the end

786
01:40:57.926 --> 01:41:02.748
I'll walk with you

787
01:41:02.749 --> 01:41:07.749
I'll walk with you, my love

788
01:41:10.135 --> 01:41:14.411
And with my heart

789
01:41:14.412 --> 01:41:18.234
I'll speak the truth

790
01:41:18.235 --> 01:41:21.568
And only then, to you

791
01:41:58.448 --> 01:42:03.448
Glory be to all our love

792
01:42:03.887 --> 01:42:08.887
That flows a mighty river

793
01:42:11.008 --> 01:42:16.008
And glory to the open plains

794
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:22.280
That hold it like no other
