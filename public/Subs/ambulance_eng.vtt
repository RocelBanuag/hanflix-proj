He just wanted me
to come in and...

559

say something to you,
'cause I told myself

that if I ever got
the chance to,

Danny?

2196
01:29:38.756 --> 01:29:41.484
No, we just got a change
in the pitching rotation.

2197

ANSON: Hi, Will.

2198
01:29:43.154 --> 01:29:45.687
You boys having a little
squabble in there, huh?

2199
01:29:45.822 --> 01:29:47.319
What's your plan here, man?

2200

we disappeared.

We're pulling off.</i>

2205
01:29:56.169 --> 01:29:58.243
You know, it seems to me like
we're the only ones trying

2206
01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.816
to keep these people alive,
Special Agent.

Oh, yeah? How you figure?

2208
01:30:01.936 --> 01:30:03.370
Just give us some space.

2209
01:30:03.505 --> 01:30:04.981
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one, no?

2210
01:30:05.005 --> 01:30:06.715
Yeah, apparently not.

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:08.993
ANSON: I've seen your file.
I mean, you joined the Marines

2212
01:30:09.017 --> 01:30:11.088
so you wouldn't have to end up
like dipshit brother Danny

2213
01:30:11.112 --> 01:30:12.320
or your psycho dad LT, right?

2214
01:30:12.456 --> 01:30:13.495
I mean, you're
a fucking war hero, man.

2215
01:30:13.519 --> 01:30:14.985
What are you doing?

2216
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.434
That was yesterday.
We're talking about today.

ANSON:
Just shut the fuck up, Danny.

2219
01:30:19.627 --> 01:30:20.989
What are you,
his fucking lawyer?

2220

DANNY: I'm giving him
great legal advice.

2221
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:23.475
ANSON: Will, listen to me.
You got a family.

01:30:23.499 --> 01:30:24.542
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

2223
01:30:24.566 --> 01:30:25.575
You gonna tell him
it's 30 years?

2224
01:30:25.599 --> 01:30:26.931
You take a hostage,
it's 30 years?

2225
01:30:27.067 --> 01:30:27.660
- You gonna tell him, Anson?
- It's time to call it quits.

2226
01:30:27.796 --> 01:30:28.865
Just pull over, man.

2227
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.442
Fucking reading you
out of the playbook.

2228
01:30:30.466 --> 01:30:31.782
- ANSON: Don't listen to him.
- DANNY: You take a hostage,

2229
01:30:31.806 --> 01:30:33.375
- it's 30 years.
- Danny, this is between Will and I.

- Will, focus.

to call your wife right now?

Do not call my wife.

He's got your best interests,
my friend. That's it.

2234
01:30:39.879 --> 01:30:41.450
There's only so much
I can do for you, Will.

2235
01:30:41.474 --> 01:30:42.827
- 30 years.
- ANSON: You've got a family.

2236
01:30:42.851 --> 01:30:44.289
- Ask him what happens when you shoot a cop.
- Shut up!

2237
01:30:44.313 --> 01:30:46.153
Tate will only see his daddy
behind plexiglass.

ANSON:
What the fuck are you doing?

2239
01:30:47.714 --> 01:30:49.194
The truth is he probably won't
even want to see you at all.

2240
01:30:49.218 --> 01:30:50.882
Okay, everybody...
everybody just shut up!

2241

Everybody just shut up, okay?

ANSON: You're gonna dig your
own grave on this one, my man.

01:30:54.822 --> 01:30:55.822
I can give you an out,

2244
01:30:55.893 --> 01:30:57.860
but I can only do that
right now.

live east of Downtown?

2256
01:31:31.028 --> 01:31:33.064
Sorry. My husband is
an environmental attorney.

to start today, so...
