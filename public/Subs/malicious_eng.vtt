1
00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:36.285
I hate these things.

2
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.256
Hello?

3
00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:51.717
We're closed.

4
00:00:58.434 --> 00:00:59.349
Is someone there?

5
00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:01.435
Rosaline?

6
00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:04.813
Where are you, I can't?

7
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.402
Rosaline!

8
00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:12.404
-Rosaline!

9
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.198
Ma'am,
are you all right?

10
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:15.023
Are you okay?

11
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.241
You were screaming.

12
00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:19.027
Yeah, I guess I had a nightmare.

13
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.704
Sometimes, I fall
asleep standing.

14
00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.291
I didn't know that Cameron
hired a new security guard.

15
00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:28.754
I live across the street,
haven't seen you before.

16
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:31.706
Yeah, Monday was my first day.

17
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.383
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't tell Cameron

18
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.302
I fell asleep at work.

19
00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:36.845
Your secret's safe with me.

20
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:40.516
So, I guess the
theater's doing better?

21
00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:44.886
Cameron's had a rough
couple years.

22
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.605
She was in a bad car accident

23
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.889
and one trouble led to another.

24
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.274
Trouble?

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.110
Well, like money trouble
among other things,

26
00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:53.487
but I'm sure it's all
in the past.

27
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.239
I'm not really one of gossip.

28
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.657
Oh, of course.

29
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.784
Anyway, oh crap.

30
00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.827
I gotta go.

31
00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:01.403
My hospital shift
starts in an hour.

32
00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:03.080
Long night?

33
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:04.289
Sometimes.

34
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.917
It's one of the perks
of being single.

35
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.076
You sure you're okay?

36
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.411
I'm fine.

37
00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:10.169
All right.

38
00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.631
One more thing.

39
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.342
You should grab a chair from
Cameron's office to sit on.

40
00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:16.135
As long as you put it
back before you leave,

41
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.177
she won't care.

42
00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:19.588
Be a lot more comfortable
to fall asleep on.

43
00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:20.389
That's a good idea.

44
00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.108
All right,

45
00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:33.777
new cameras are up and rolling.

46
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:35.270
Call if you have any problems.

47
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.780
Of course.

48
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:37.614
Thank you.

49
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:42.110
Okay, so all of my backups
are right here.

50
00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.945
Much more secure.

51
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.666
And this is our portable
monitor, all right?

52
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.950
I have to go.

53
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.669
I'll see you later.

54
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.296
Cameron, wait.

55
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:54.965
Can you show how to work the
new system before you leave?

56
00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:57.634
Sure, right quick.

57
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.303
So right here,

58
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.796
all the cameras are on the
outside of the building.

59
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.308
We have cameras on the alley,

60
00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.353
the backstage, front of
the house, and theater.

61
00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.439
So you just have to click
here to see each view.

62
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.149
Go ahead.

63
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:14.985
Who's that?

64
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.811
I'm so sorry.

65
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:17.613
Let me just.

66
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.622
Excuse me?

67
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.001
Rosaline, what are you doing?

68
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:31.826
Can I borrow it?

69
00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:32.586
Rosaline.

70
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.670
It's real leather.

71
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:36.089
Can you imagine how cool
and mysterious I'd look

72
00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:37.132
if I came into school
with this tomorrow?

73
00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:38.342
I'm sure you would, honey,

74
00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.093
but this is a place of business,

75
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.595
not your personal closet.

76
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.512
Sorry, Cameron.

77
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.555
You know what?

78
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.349
Just take it.

79
00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:46.767
It'll look great on you.

80
00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.519
And I'm sure it'll make
quite an impression,

81
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.063
that is, if your mom says yes.

82
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:57.027
Just don't touch the costume
jewelry in this case.

83
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:58.737
Some of them are pretty fragile,
okay?

84
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.530
Thanks for the jacket.

85
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.741
Thank you, seriously.

86
00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.576
And thanks for the job.

87
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:10.040
I think a new job and a new
school would be a fresh start.

88
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:15.462
When did leather jackets
come back in style?

89
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.839
Who knows with kids.

90
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.461
Stay awake, Izzy.

91
00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.089
Stay awake.

92
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:21.445
Morning.

93
00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.444
Hey, hey.

94
00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.412
From the corner store.

95
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.781
Best espresso in the
whole neighborhood.

96
00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:33.999
Oh, let me just--

97
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.375
No, no, no, please.
It's a gift.

98
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:37.285
I know how brutal the
night shift can be

99
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.295
before you get adjusted.

100
00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:40.964
And after you get adjusted.

101
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.791
Well, in that case.

102
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:43.592
Cheers.

103
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.971
Mm, that is good.

104
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.723
It's amazing, right?

105
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.966
My daughter and I just moved
to the suburbs near here

106
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:53.518
and don't really know anyone

107
00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.637
or anything in the neighborhood.

108
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.523
Well, now you know where
to get good coffee.

109
00:05:58.609 --> 00:05:59.900
And now, you know me.

110
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.821
Are you studying to get
your masters?

111
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:11.078
Yeah, I am, an MBA in
theater management.

112
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:12.487
It's one of the reasons I
took this job,

113
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.248
to get some peace and
quiet to study.

114
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:16.750
Be careful what you wish for.

115
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.126
You know, you should try
listening to classical music

116
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:19.336
when you study.

117
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.004
I used do that back in
medical school.

118
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:21.838
That's a good idea.

119
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.631
Any recs?

120
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.632
Yeah, actually,

121
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.302
Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture
will definitely keep you, yeah--

122
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:28.345
Sorry.

123
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.505
It's got the cannons at the end.

124
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.182
You know, I actually won a baton

125
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.394
that belonged to Tchaikovsky
at a charity auction last year.

126
00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:36.603
And now that I'm saying
that out loud,

127
00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.563
that is the nerdiest thing
I've ever said.

128
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.014
I'm so sorry.

129
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:41.358
Well, everybody has a hobby.

130
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.237
Anyway, how's the job going?

131
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.489
No complaints.

132
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.698
Why?

133
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:49.783
No reason.

134
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.862
It's just, well, the
local high school theater

135
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.163
puts on their fall play here

136
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.873
and Cameron barely
charges them anything,

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.533
which is totally nice.

138
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:01.878
But she gave a key to the
building to the old director,

139
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.131
but she barely knew him.

140
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.133
I got kind of a creepy vibe.

141
00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:08.468
Well, she gave me a key
and barely knows me,

142
00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:11.221
but she did a background
check on me first.

143
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.932
Well, I'm just kind of
worried about her.

144
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:14.891
There's been a lot of
people coming

145
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.435
and going at odd hours recently.

146
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.895
I mean, the whole
neighborhood's talking.

147
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.564
Mr. Adams, he owns the
diner down the street.

148
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.732
He thinks that it's loan sharks.

149
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.234
Loan sharks, like people who--

150
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:27.237
Bust your knee cap or slice
your face if you don't pay.

151
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.071
I know, scary.

152
00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:32.284
Anyway, on that note,
I gotta go,

153
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.452
but enjoy your coffee.

154
00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:34.244
We'll talk soon?

155
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.704
I'll be here.

156
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:36.746
Awesome.

157
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:37.456
Oh, and thanks again for this.

158
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:38.540
Of course.

159
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.082
Enjoy.

160
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.424
You have
everything you need?

161
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:49.259
Phone, keys, EpiPen?

162
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.260
Mom, yes.

163
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.420
We've been through all
this already.

164
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.513
Show me.

165
00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.435
Happy?

166
00:07:58.562 --> 00:07:59.811
Very.

167
00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:01.104
Stop worrying.

168
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:06.401
How are you?

169
00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:07.444
Fine.

170
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:08.778
Work's okay?

171
00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:09.529
Of course, honey.

172
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.282
Working nights isn't
the greatest,

173
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.035
but I get to spend time
with you during the day.

174
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.037
Lemons into lemonade, right?

175
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.250
No coffee.

176
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:23.451
-I passed you a soda.
-Sheesh, mom.

177
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.669
That's more than
enough caffeine.

178
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:25.795
God, it's just coffee.

179
00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.547
It's not like I'm
asking to do drugs.

180
00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:29.341
Caffeine is a drug, thank
you very much,

181
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.135
and it's just as
dangerous as any other.

182
00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.131
Plus, I packed like three
energy shots in here.

183
00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:37.849
You don't want it.

184
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:38.975
Seriously?

185
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:40.559
Oh yeah, that's not
dangerous at all.

186
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.136
No wonder you've
been so jittery.

187
00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:44.472
It's fine.

188
00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:45.357
I'm fine.

189
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.481
As for you, you should get
a good night's sleep tonight

190
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.824
instead of chit
chatting on the phone.

191
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:56.284
I miss my friends.

192
00:08:57.621 --> 00:08:59.663
I know, honey.

193
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.124
You'll make new ones.

194
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.660
All right.

195
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.546
Knock 'em dead, honey.

196
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.340
I always do.

197
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:42.581
Help, help me!

198
00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:47.711
Help me!

199
00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:52.841
Stay away from her!

200
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.720
Cameron?

201
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.643
Come on, Izzy, get a grip.

202
00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.994
Mr. Cho, I'm Rosaline's mom.

203
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.037
We have a meeting?

204
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.413
We had a meeting at 4:00.

205
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.572
Now, it's nearly 5:00.

206
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.124
I really need to speak with you.

207
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.077
Ms. Richardson, Rosaline
skipped my class,

208
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:30.745
was caught making
out with a boy,

209
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.340
and didn't submit an
essay she was assigned.

210
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.759
She has detention and
that's final.

211
00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:36.760
I understand

212
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.845
and I'm very sorry I was late,

213
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.097
but I wanna speak with you
about Rosaline's behavior,

214
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.766
not excuse it.

215
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:43.642
Rosaline,

216
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.429
we both have been having
a difficult time

217
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.431
with the death of her father.

218
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.432
My husband.

219
00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.442
He died last year.

220
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:55.445
Sorry for your loss.

221
00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.238
After he died,

222
00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:59.449
Rosaline's been acting
out, skipping school,

223
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:02.619
running off, but she's
not a bad kid.

224
00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.956
We moved here for a fresh start,
you know?

225
00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:10.335
Have you considered a therapist?

226
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.338
Rosaline had brief counseling
for a few months last year,

227
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.799
but I haven't found
anywhere here yet.

228
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:18.968
I can get a referral
from the school counselor

229
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:22.555
and you should encourage
her to join some clubs.

230
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.100
Maybe she can audition
for the Fall play.

231
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.434
Thanks for the suggestion,

232
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:28.687
but I'm not sure Rosaline
is much of a theater kid.

233
00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.021
Are you sure?

234
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.065
This year's play is the
"Twelfth Night."

235
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.857
It's very funny.

236
00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:34.642
The kids always love it.

237
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:38.071
Well, I'll see if
she's interested.

238
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.698
If she decides to audition,

239
00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.826
maybe I can pull some
strings and get her a part.

240
00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:44.327
I know the director.

241
00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.163
Kidding, everyone gets a part.

242
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.374
It's not a very big
theater club.

243
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:58.591
He's the one your daughter
was getting friendly with.

244
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.635
Definitely have to talk to
her about that.

245
00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.097
Anyway, I'll let you know.

246
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.006
Ms. Richardson.

247
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.640
Call me Isabel.

248
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.351
In that case, call me Henry.

249
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.936
I'll see you around, Isabel.

250
00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:17.819
Hi, mom.

251
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.696
Hi.

252
00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:22.073
Maybe you could introduce
me to your friend.

253
00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.324
Mom, this is Jonathan.

254
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.409
Jonathan, this is my mom.

255
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.194
It's nice to meet you, Ms.
Richardson.

256
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:28.246
Nice to meet you too,

257
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.956
although it would be even nicer

258
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.500
if you and my daughter hadn't
gotten detention together.

259
00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:35.203
Yeah.

260
00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:36.204
I should probably get going.

261
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:37.705
My mom's waiting.

262
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.424
Oh, maybe you could
introduce me.

263
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.092
Sure.

264
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:44.721
What?

265
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.306
Mom, hey.

266
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.974
You're practically
grounded for--

267
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.479
Ms. Richardson, this is my mom.

268
00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.272
Mom, this is Rosaline
and her mom.

269
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.315
They just moved to town.

270
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.151
Yeah, it's good to
see you again.

271
00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:01.729
It's good to see you again too.

272
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.782
Oh, you guys know each other?

273
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.785
Well, we never officially
exchanged names.

274
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:07.786
I'm Isabel.

275
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:08.620
Megan.

276
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.407
Well, I guess we'd
better get going.

277
00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:14.918
Nice to meet you, Jonathan.

278
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:15.960
I'll see you soon.

279
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.420
-Bye.
-Bye.

280
00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:20.924
Super cute.

281
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.417
No, I'm just
trying to help.

282
00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:24.594
You really wanna help?

283
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.012
I need another loan.

284
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.516
I'm sorry, I have given
you all I can give.

285
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:32.101
Do you have any idea
what they'll do if I can't pay?

286
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:33.594
You owe me!

287
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.313
I'm the one that used
my connections

288
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.315
for your posh apartment.

289
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.275
I'm the one that introduced you!

290
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.154
This is a private conversation!

291
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.439
-Cameron?
-Go.

292
00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:47.575
I'm sorry, the door was open.

293
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.672
Sit outside and stop
drunk people

294
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.290
from peeing on the front
steps or something.

295
00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.300
I don't pay you to eavesdrop.

296
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.094
I didn't hear anything.

297
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.933
Okay, I need to scale
back on these.

298
00:14:55.604 --> 00:14:58.104
Help, help!

299
00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:13.027
Somebody's being murdered
at 1739 Harwood Street,

300
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:16.039
third floor, downtown, across
from the Regent Theater.

301
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:19.542
No!

302
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.680
Hurry, third floor.

303
00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.891
Can you give us a
description of the victim?

304
00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:47.403
Yes, she's maybe about
five seven, white, long hair.

305
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.562
No, no.

306
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:49.897
Chin length hair,

307
00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.659
wearing a white shirt
and red pants.

308
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.705
This is the police,
open the door.

309
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.293
Officers, can I help you?

310
00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:03.628
It can't be.

311
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:04.745
Ma'am, someone reported screams

312
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.247
coming from this apartment.

313
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.340
Do you live here?

314
00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.967
I do.

315
00:16:09.052 --> 00:16:11.302
I was actually watching
a scary movie earlier.

316
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.587
Could that be what they heard?

317
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:15.098
What are those scratches from?

318
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.935
Oh, my cat.

319
00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:20.436
I was trying to give him
the bath earlier

320
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.647
and he hates water.

321
00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.236
You're welcome to come in
and take a look around.

322
00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:49.590
Oh, well, keep the TV down.

323
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:51.926
I will.

324
00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.720
I'm so sorry about that,
officers.

325
00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:54.846
Have a good night.

326
00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.018
Ms. Richardson, are you
sure you're all right?

327
00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:01.144
What?

328
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.803
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

329
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:06.773
I saw a woman get murdered.

330
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.569
I did.

331
00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.820
She was pounding on the
window, screaming for help.

332
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.781
Someone put a rope around
her neck, dragged her away.

333
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.579
But when we opened the door,
there she was.

334
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.492
Look, I know how
crazy it sounds,

335
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:25.710
but I couldn't make this up.

336
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.299
Are these yours?

337
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.052
All of them?

338
00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.261
It's a new job.

339
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.221
It's been hard to stay awake.

340
00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.807
You know caffeine is a
powerful mind altering drug.

341
00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.518
That's what I always
tell my daughter.

342
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.021
Add in all the chemicals
in these energy shots

343
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.182
plus the sleep deprivation
that has you taking them,

344
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.734
your mind can play
tricks on you.

345
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.402
What are you saying, detective?

346
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:52.686
I'm sure this was scary for you,

347
00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.188
but no one was killed.

348
00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:57.191
You made it up, imagined it.

349
00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.869
I know what I saw.

350
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.289
24/7 energy boost can
have strong side effects.

351
00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:04.415
And like I said--

352
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.533
Lack of sleep, I know,

353
00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.044
but that's not what's
happening here.

354
00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.545
It felt real.

355
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.964
Not just felt, it was real.

356
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.299
I know it was.

357
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:15.551
If that's the case, then
where's the evidence?

358
00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.596
When your shift is over,

359
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:20.473
you should go home and
get a good night's sleep,

360
00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:20.973
Ms. Richardson.

361
00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.392
I'm a single mother of
a 16 year old daughter.

362
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.269
I'd be lucky to get five hours.

363
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.605
At the very least, ease
off the caffeine

364
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.233
and get some blackout curtains.

365
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.725
They really do help.

366
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.861
Thank you, detective, really.

367
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.290
Morning, mom.

368
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:47.166
How was work?

369
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.255
Mom?

370
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.132
What's wrong, honey?

371
00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:55.800
Nothing, I was just
saying good morning.

372
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.753
Not like you ever listen
to anything I say.

373
00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.765
Rosaline, I am absolutely
not in a mood for this today.

374
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:04.934
Sorry.

375
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.148
Oh, Mr. Cho said that I can
take a test for extra credit

376
00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.941
if I come in this morning.

377
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.443
Our conversation isn't over,
you know?

378
00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.155
Yeah, I think it is.

379
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.867
Rosaline, I don't wanna
fight with you.

380
00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.451
Then why won't you let me
date boys, mom?

381
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:23.786
Is that a rhetorical question?

382
00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.748
It's us against the world,
remember,

383
00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.500
not us against each other.

384
00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.878
Yeah, but mom, you don't
even know Jonathan.

385
00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:32.786
Well, when you get your
English grade up,

386
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:33.963
we will discuss it.

387
00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.800
Why are you sitting in
the dark anyway?

388
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.135
You don't want to open
up the curtains,

389
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.595
get some light in here?

390
00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.476
Have you been
sleepwalking again?

391
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:48.978
What?
No, I'm fine.

392
00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:50.396
And thank you.

393
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.982
For what?

394
00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.151
Taking my advice about
joining the theater club.

395
00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:57.403
I think it'll be good for you.

396
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:58.988
Yeah, we'll see.

397
00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.981
Oh, the parent-teacher
conference is this afternoon.

398
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:01.815
Can you be there?

399
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.201
Of course, honey.

400
00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.162
I'll pick you up from school
and we'll drive over together.

401
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.996
Cool.

402
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:19.425
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.170
You work here?

404
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.388
Well, she's--

405
00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.673
That's cool.

406
00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.016
Are you a manager?

407
00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:31.854
I'm a security guard, but
maybe one day.

408
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.482
My mom is studying to
be a theater manager.

409
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.483
Cool.

410
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:37.360
All right, let's all
head inside.

411
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:38.277
After you.

412
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.909
I'll be right back.

413
00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.804
So cute, he used to wear
his shirt just like that.

414
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.046
For you.

415
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.716
Oh, I don't drink coffee,
thanks.

416
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.050
You don't, since when?

417
00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:10.851
I'll take that coffee, mom.

418
00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:11.602
Nice try, kid.

419
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:12.770
Stop calling me kid.

420
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:13.771
You're embarrassing me.

421
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:15.773
I'll stop calling you kid
when you stop being one.

422
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:16.557
You know what?

423
00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:17.391
It's early enough.

424
00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.401
I'll take it.

425
00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:19.402
Thank you.

426
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.562
Good, 'cause I wanted
to pay you back

427
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.031
and to apologize for
the other night.

428
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.827
-Henry.
-Henry?

429
00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:29.996
Hey, nice to see you again.

430
00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:30.997
You too.

431
00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:33.749
Good afternoon, Rosaline,
Jonathan, Ms. Everett.

432
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:34.667
Hi, Mr. Cho.

433
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.963
Told you, "Twelfth Night,"
it's hard to resist.

434
00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:40.923
Yeah, thanks for
that suggestion.

435
00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:47.805
Okay, everyone.

436
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.433
Can we make our way
into the theater please?

437
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.267
Thank you very much.

438
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.264
Half these kids look like
they're sleep walking.

439
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.358
They could use a good
dose of that 1812.

440
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:02.695
What?

441
00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:06.699
1812, the Tchaikovsky
Overture you recommended.

442
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.076
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

443
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:13.289
Are you okay?

444
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:16.083
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

445
00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:19.170
I was gardening the other day

446
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.789
and I tripped and fell
into my rose bush

447
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:23.716
and got all scratched up.

448
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.134
It's kind of embarrassing.

449
00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:27.261
Okay.

450
00:22:27.347 --> 00:22:29.513
You know, I'm gonna use
the ladies room.

451
00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.376
Is everything okay?

452
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:06.008
Oh, yeah, I was just
admiring the architecture.

453
00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:10.262
The theater has such a
beautiful design, right?

454
00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:11.680
It isn't my place,

455
00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:15.684
but that seemed like a
pretty intense argument

456
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:17.311
with you and Cameron last night.

457
00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:20.898
Cameron can be a bit
intense sometimes,

458
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:24.402
but she's harmless.

459
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:25.528
At least, I think she is.

460
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.522
You sure you're okay?

461
00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:31.024
You seem different.

462
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:36.196
You know, I'm just dealing
with some old wounds

463
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.165
that have been
reopening recently.

464
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.168
My ex-husband, he's,

465
00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:42.536
well, we got
divorced a year ago.

466
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.048
He was sleeping with
the secretary.

467
00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:48.634
That's horrible.

468
00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:51.220
I know, and so cliche too.

469
00:23:52.682 --> 00:23:55.766
Anyway, he's been wanting
to spend a lot of time

470
00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:57.059
with Jonathan recently,

471
00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.104
and just afraid he is
gonna be a bad influence,

472
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:00.980
you know?

473
00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:03.274
Burden of being a parent.

474
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:06.986
So what about you?

475
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.397
Are you married, divorced?

476
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.242
My husband died last year,
actually.

477
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:15.161
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

478
00:24:15.246 --> 00:24:15.995
Thanks.

479
00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:19.573
Tell me about him.

480
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:20.458
Really?

481
00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:21.500
If you want to.

482
00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:24.411
I mean, you don't have
to if it's too painful.

483
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:26.380
It's been 13 months
since the car accident.

484
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:30.759
I wanna talk about him.

485
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:31.802
His name was Finn.

486
00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:35.097
He was the funniest person
I've ever known

487
00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:36.807
or ever will know probably.

488
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.395
We were best friends
from the moment we met.

489
00:24:43.107 --> 00:24:44.648
You must really miss him.

490
00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:49.820
I do, but I have to keep
moving forward for Rosaline.

491
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:51.864
He would've wanted that.

492
00:24:56.746 --> 00:24:58.287
Sorry if I've been a bit nosy.

493
00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:01.448
I just really
appreciate your kindness

494
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.209
and wanna make sure you're okay.

495
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:06.453
These nights can be really long

496
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:09.840
and seeing your cheery
face each morning

497
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.884
with a coffee in hand,

498
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.971
it's a lifesaver, so thank you.

499
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:20.559
Well, I'm really glad I met you.

500
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:30.236
I'll see you downstairs?

501
00:25:48.422 --> 00:25:49.213
Hello?

502
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.590
Hello?

503
00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:58.764
Wait a minute.

504
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:02.393
The security footage.

505
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:12.736
Cameron?

506
00:26:32.216 --> 00:26:33.841
Is somebody there?

507
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:25.476
Whoever you are,
you're trespassing.

508
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.895
Leave before I call the police!

509
00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:20.647
Isabel, what are you doing here?

510
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:21.490
I work here.

511
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:22.983
What are you doing here?

512
00:28:23.077 --> 00:28:25.828
I left my wallet earlier,
came back to grab it,

513
00:28:25.955 --> 00:28:27.246
heard a noise.

514
00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:29.873
Are you all right?

515
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:31.500
What happened?

516
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:36.338
A few nights ago, I
witnessed something.

517
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:43.887
A crime, a murder, or I
thought it was,

518
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:47.307
but the police don't believe
me and I don't have any proof.

519
00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:53.021
But look, that's
where it happened.

520
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:54.606
It might have been
caught on camera,

521
00:28:54.692 --> 00:28:57.526
but someone attacked me,
destroyed the hard drive.

522
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:00.446
If nothing happened,

523
00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:03.949
then why did someone bother
to destroy the footage?

524
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.910
Isabel.

525
00:29:09.165 --> 00:29:10.372
I sound crazy.

526
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.041
You've had a shock.

527
00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:14.293
We gotta call the cops.

528
00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:15.335
So you believe me?

529
00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:19.131
When you've eliminated
the impossible,

530
00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:23.177
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

531
00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.346
Sherlock Holmes.

532
00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:30.684
You really are an
English teacher.

533
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.935
It's incurable.

534
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:41.361
Just go to the ER,

535
00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:43.814
get your head checked
out just in case.

536
00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:45.649
I'm fine, really.

537
00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:47.826
That's why I said just in case.

538
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.661
I agree with Cameron.

539
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:50.788
It can't hurt, right?

540
00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.501
Detective, can I talk
to you outside?

541
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:02.382
This is connected to what
happened the other night.

542
00:30:02.468 --> 00:30:05.168
Ms. Richardson, nothing
happened the other night.

543
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:08.055
Someone hit at me over the
head and wrecked the office.

544
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.223
It can't be a coincidence.

545
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:12.008
Look, the safe is open.

546
00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:13.510
Whoever broke in was
looking for cash,

547
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:14.845
got mad when they
couldn't find any,

548
00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:16.313
and trashed the place.

549
00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:19.858
You still believe there
was a murder,

550
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.402
and what, a coverup?

551
00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:25.739
You saw the so-called murder
victim with your own two eyes.

552
00:30:25.825 --> 00:30:26.782
Ms. Richardson--

553
00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:28.242
I know something
happened that night.

554
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:30.026
I know.

555
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.203
Good day, Ms. Richardson.

556
00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:47.344
I'll meet you up there.

557
00:31:17.835 --> 00:31:21.295
Rosaline, what are you doing?

558
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.923
Nothing, just cleaning
up, hanging up clothes.

559
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.249
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

560
00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:27.342
It looks like you're trying

561
00:31:27.428 --> 00:31:29.094
to pick out an
outfit for a date.

562
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:31.722
Who's the lucky boy?

563
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:32.973
Okay, mom, I--

564
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.099
Rosaline May Richardson,

565
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.092
you did not ask out
that delinquent.

566
00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:37.260
Mom, it's one date.

567
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:38.770
What's so wrong with him, mom?

568
00:31:38.898 --> 00:31:42.599
It's not him exactly.

569
00:31:42.693 --> 00:31:45.235
How well do you even
know him or his family?

570
00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:48.572
And is it the best idea
to start dating someone

571
00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:49.823
so soon after the move?

572
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:52.576
Okay, look, I know I
freaked you out before,

573
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:53.911
and you want me to stay
out of trouble,

574
00:31:53.996 --> 00:31:56.997
and I have been, but
now I can't meet people?

575
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.290
I mean, come on, mom.

576
00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:00.334
Didn't you go on dates when
you were in high school?

577
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.168
Well, of course I did.

578
00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:01.793
Then what's the problem?

579
00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:03.128
Is it dad

580
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:05.797
or you're lonely so everyone
else has to be lonely too?

581
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:06.381
Hey.

582
00:32:08.302 --> 00:32:09.176
I'm sorry, but seriously.

583
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:10.177
You know if dad were here,

584
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:11.845
he wouldn't be so
weird about it.

585
00:32:19.313 --> 00:32:20.103
Fine.

586
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.473
You're bound and determined
to go out with him,

587
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:25.475
so go ahead, but I'm driving.

588
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:26.860
No, mom, come on.

589
00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:28.070
Oh, mom, come on, no.

590
00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:29.196
That's the deal.

591
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.156
-Take it or leave it.
-Fine.

592
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:33.367
Do you have any shoes
that'll go with my dress?

593
00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.703
You're sure they live here?

594
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:37.746
Yeah, why?

595
00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:39.656
I thought they had an
apartment in town.

596
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.490
I don't know, mom.

597
00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.500
Maybe they have two.

598
00:32:42.628 --> 00:32:43.043
Your skirt's a little short,
isn't it?

599
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:47.506
Hi, Ms. Richardson.

600
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.166
Ready to go?

601
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.468
-Mm-hmm.
-Sure.

602
00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:53.387
Actually, can I talk to
your mother for a minute?

603
00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:54.304
Oh, she's not here.

604
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.347
I think she had a meeting

605
00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:56.890
with the lady who
owns the theater.

606
00:32:56.976 --> 00:32:57.391
Oh, Cameron?

607
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:00.352
Well then, let's go.

608
00:33:02.982 --> 00:33:05.232
Love this jacket on you.

609
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.275
Looks like she's quite
the gardener.

610
00:33:07.361 --> 00:33:09.111
I don't see any rose bushes.

611
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.530
We don't have any rose bushes.

612
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.867
And you don't have a cat,
do you?

613
00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:17.911
-Mom?
-No.

614
00:33:17.997 --> 00:33:18.996
What are you doing?

615
00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:21.248
Come on, we're gonna be late,
come on.

616
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.542
Right, let's get you guys
to the movies.

617
00:34:23.062 --> 00:34:24.978
I actually won a baton
that belonged to Tchaikovsky

618
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:27.063
at a charity auction last year.

619
00:34:49.922 --> 00:34:51.955
-Yes?

620
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:54.674
My shift just ended,
came in to say goodbye.

621
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.675
Great.
Thanks, Isabel.

622
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.054
Is there anything else?

623
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:00.931
I wanted to ask you
about the case

624
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:02.390
with the costume jewelry.

625
00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:05.393
I thought maybe we
could move it.

626
00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.188
No, don't touch that.

627
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:09.106
It's very valuable.

628
00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:10.857
I'm sorry.

629
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.069
It's just that it doesn't
quite fit in the case.

630
00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:16.071
I didn't notice it before.

631
00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:17.280
Have you had it for a while?

632
00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:21.660
No, and it's not gonna be
here for long.

633
00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:24.320
Where'd you get it?

634
00:35:24.414 --> 00:35:26.998
You ask a lot of questions.

635
00:35:27.126 --> 00:35:27.991
It was a gift.

636
00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:29.292
Someone gave that to you?

637
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:31.711
My gosh.

638
00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:34.339
Listen, I'd appreciate
it if you kept this quiet

639
00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:35.465
kind of like how I've been quiet

640
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.008
about your so-called
study habits

641
00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:39.136
when you were supposed
to be working.

642
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.852
Are you sure you're okay, mom?

643
00:35:46.979 --> 00:35:48.228
Huh?

644
00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:50.346
Oh, of course, honey,

645
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.982
nothing you need to worry about.

646
00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:56.111
You can tell me things if
it's money or something.

647
00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:59.189
I'm old enough to get an
after school job.

648
00:35:59.283 --> 00:36:01.191
No, no, no, no, we're fine.

649
00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:02.701
I appreciate you offering.

650
00:36:02.828 --> 00:36:03.493
Okay.

651
00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:05.620
Love you, mom.

652
00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:08.456
Mom?

653
00:36:08.542 --> 00:36:12.252
Right, have a good
day at school.

654
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:34.566
Pull yourself together, Izzy.

655
00:37:57.651 --> 00:38:00.568
Stake outs seem a lot
more fun in the movies.

656
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:31.016
Make no compare
between that love a woman

657
00:38:31.143 --> 00:38:33.393
can bear me and
that I owe Olivia.

658
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:34.352
Aye, but I know.

659
00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:36.187
What dost thou know?

660
00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:38.982
Too well what
love women to men may owe.

661
00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.901
In faith, they are as true
of heart as we.

662
00:38:41.987 --> 00:38:44.362
My father had a
daughter loved a man.

663
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.023
As it might be, perhaps,
were I a woman.

664
00:38:47.117 --> 00:38:48.533
I should, your lordship.

665
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.536
That's great, guys.

666
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:54.197
Let's skip to the end for a bit.

667
00:38:54.291 --> 00:38:57.709
Jonathan, wanna start
on line 2415?

668
00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:04.707
One face, one voice, one
habit, and two persons.

669
00:39:05.344 --> 00:39:07.093
Let's actually take 10, guys.

670
00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:07.927
Awesome work.

671
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:11.264
Good job.

672
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.882
-Hey.
-Hey.

673
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:15.226
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt your rehearsal.

674
00:39:15.354 --> 00:39:16.061
No, it's fine.

675
00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:17.854
They needed a break anyway.

676
00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:22.058
Are you here for the parent
fundraising meeting later?

677
00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:23.559
Henry, I basically live here.

678
00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:24.903
I'm here for a lot of things,

679
00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:27.730
but I did wanna talk to you.

680
00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:30.408
Oh, about Rosalie?

681
00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:32.160
Not about her, per se.

682
00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.622
You'll think I'm a
horrible gossip.

683
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:39.542
Come on, I teach at a high
school in the suburbs.

684
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.295
I promise you I've
heard worse gossip.

685
00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:46.299
How well do you know Megan?

686
00:39:46.385 --> 00:39:49.803
She's really helped with
the theater club this year

687
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.421
after Mr. Branson left.

688
00:39:51.515 --> 00:39:52.764
Mr. Branson?

689
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:55.683
The old 12th grade
English teacher.

690
00:39:55.769 --> 00:39:58.428
He ran the theater club
until he retired last year.

691
00:39:58.522 --> 00:40:01.564
To be honest, I would've been
really lost without Megan.

692
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.599
She made all the
arrangements with Cameron

693
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:05.652
to rent the theater out again.

694
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:08.363
She's the one who made the
arrangements with Cameron?

695
00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:10.273
Well, Mr. Branson
started it all,

696
00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:13.576
but she took over as
school liaison.

697
00:40:15.038 --> 00:40:16.287
Why do you wanna know?

698
00:40:16.415 --> 00:40:17.622
Rosaline and Jonathan

699
00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.998
have been spending a lot
of time together

700
00:40:19.084 --> 00:40:22.252
and I just wanna know who
she's hanging out with.

701
00:40:23.463 --> 00:40:26.005
Especially after what
happened with the two of them?

702
00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.635
Maybe I'm being a
helicopter mom,

703
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:32.887
but after the year she's had,

704
00:40:32.973 --> 00:40:34.514
I just wanna make
sure she's okay.

705
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:35.598
I get that.

706
00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:40.520
Megan is tenacious.

707
00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.305
Her ex had great lawyers,

708
00:40:42.399 --> 00:40:46.025
but she still ended up with
custody, alimony, and the house.

709
00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:48.987
She's someone who gets
what she wants.

710
00:40:52.284 --> 00:40:53.825
Did you hear that?

711
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:55.985
Look out!

712
00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:00.165
Are you okay?

713
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.961
Tell me
what happened--

714
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:05.753
It's so
irresponsible.

715
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:06.546
I have no idea.

716
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:07.663
I have no idea.

717
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:09.841
I cannot believe that that's--

718
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:12.001
-Still on the stage?
-Yeah.

719
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.428
Do you know what
happened at the stage?

720
00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:14.679
You know, I don't know.

721
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:16.139
One of the lights fell down

722
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:18.174
and I'm not sure how
it happened.

723
00:41:18.268 --> 00:41:20.351
It's so terrible, isn't it?

724
00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:21.177
It's unsafe.

725
00:41:21.271 --> 00:41:22.020
It's scary.

726
00:41:22.147 --> 00:41:23.346
I'm Elena.

727
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.514
Isabel.

728
00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:27.734
This is Sharon, Kelly, Megan.

729
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:29.194
Oh, Megan and I already
know each other.

730
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:30.695
Oh.

731
00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:32.447
So I hear you're the
ones to talk to

732
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:35.033
if I wanna get Rosaline more
involved in the theater club?

733
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.075
That's right,

734
00:41:36.161 --> 00:41:37.368
even though I don't know

735
00:41:37.496 --> 00:41:38.828
how much more involved
she could be.

736
00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:41.414
I mean, she's already
the star of the show.

737
00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:44.867
Well, it's not really
about the theater group.

738
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:47.629
It's more that I'm worried
she's not making any friends.

739
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:50.873
We just moved, you know,
fresh start.

740
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.718
Well, you picked a great
place to live, right, ladies?

741
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:55.678
My daughter Therese,
she plays Olivia,

742
00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.014
she's having a slumber
party this Saturday.

743
00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:00.383
I know she already
adores Rosaline.

744
00:42:00.477 --> 00:42:01.384
She'd be welcome to come.

745
00:42:01.478 --> 00:42:03.052
That sounds great.

746
00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:04.554
I appreciate that.

747
00:42:04.648 --> 00:42:07.440
You know, you're welcome
to hang out with us too.

748
00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:09.859
We all go out to a bar
when the kids are together.

749
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:11.945
Sounds like a plan.

750
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:18.067
I can't believe Kim wore
that to a fundraiser meeting.

751
00:42:18.161 --> 00:42:19.077
That's what happens

752
00:42:20.497 --> 00:42:21.663
when your husband finds
out you're having an affair

753
00:42:21.748 --> 00:42:22.956
and then leaves you
with the electric bill.

754
00:42:24.543 --> 00:42:25.500
Hi, ladies.

755
00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.127
-Hi.
-Hi.

756
00:42:28.213 --> 00:42:30.913
-I love the bow.
-Oh, thank you.

757
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:32.590
Ladies, let's go to
the bar area.

758
00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:33.424
I like that idea.

759
00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:34.551
Let's go.

760
00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:38.254
That's why I'm saying we
should just have a bake sale.

761
00:42:38.348 --> 00:42:40.473
Oh, come on, Kim, not
another bake sale.

762
00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:42.684
Last year's bake sale
raised a thousand dollars

763
00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.269
for the fall play.

764
00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:47.096
And it was barely enough
to build the sets.

765
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.273
And besides, come on, everyone,

766
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.099
raise your hand if
someone in your family

767
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:52.235
has some sort of
dietary restriction.

768
00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:57.773
Sorry, bake sales are a
waste of time.

769
00:42:57.867 --> 00:43:00.034
Okay, then what's
your great idea?

770
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.621
Black tie fundraiser.

771
00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.115
We invite the whole
community, even the kids.

772
00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:08.293
That's not a bad idea.

773
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.003
Okay. And where
would we have this?

774
00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:11.296
Maybe one of our houses.

775
00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:12.505
I'll volunteer my house.

776
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:14.966
Oh, we could charge for tickets,

777
00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:17.802
but still have a silent
auction, a dance portion.

778
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:18.636
Maybe even a dinner.

779
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.638
Just do a whole event.

780
00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:24.267
Well then, shall we put
it to a vote?

781
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:25.852
Sure.

782
00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:29.272
All those in favor of my
brilliant idea, raise your hand.

783
00:43:33.612 --> 00:43:35.486
Mm-hmm, that's great.

784
00:43:35.614 --> 00:43:37.614
Oh, come on,
Kim, don't leave like that.

785
00:43:38.742 --> 00:43:40.783
You can bring your
snickerdoodles to the party.

786
00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:45.121
Queen Megan reigns supreme.

787
00:43:48.627 --> 00:43:50.668
So, you excited for
your sleepover?

788
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:51.494
It's not a sleepover.

789
00:43:51.588 --> 00:43:52.629
It's not?

790
00:43:54.049 --> 00:43:55.048
So I should come pick you
up after the movie then?

791
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:56.382
No, I mean, I'm
sleeping at Therese's,

792
00:43:56.468 --> 00:43:58.217
but it's not like a sleepover,
sleepover.

793
00:43:58.303 --> 00:43:59.168
Those are for kids.

794
00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:01.054
Right, 'cause you're so grown.

795
00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:02.263
Mom, come on.

796
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:03.097
And even if it were
a sleep over,

797
00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:05.058
I can't act like I'm excited.

798
00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.517
That's right,

799
00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:08.895
'cause you're pretending to
be all cool and mysterious.

800
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.979
I'm not pretending, mom.

801
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:11.347
I am cool and mysterious.

802
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:12.440
I'm sure you are, honey.

803
00:44:21.451 --> 00:44:22.158
-Hey.
-Hey.

804
00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:26.195
Oh, Therese hasn't talked
about anything

805
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.538
except Rosaline for the
past two days.

806
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.624
Aww, she really likes her too.

807
00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:30.708
Therese tells me

808
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:33.044
that Rosaline is the
coolest girl in school,

809
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:34.295
and clearly all the rest
of them agree.

810
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:36.038
I guess it's all
about confidence.

811
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.965
Fake it til you make it, right?

812
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.008
Yeah.

813
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:42.303
Girls, you can put your
bags up in Therese's room

814
00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:43.888
and then we're gonna leave.

815
00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:48.551
Jonathan, is your dad meeting
us at the theater or here?

816
00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:50.144
The theater, I guess.

817
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.978
All right, cool.

818
00:44:51.064 --> 00:44:52.888
All right, let's get going.

819
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.607
-So I'll see you later?
-Definitely.

820
00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:55.441
Okay.

821
00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:00.730
Have fun, honey.

822
00:45:00.824 --> 00:45:03.241
Oh, Jonathan, I could use
your help in the kitchen.

823
00:45:08.373 --> 00:45:11.040
Hey, you're not gonna
go to the bar with us?

824
00:45:12.502 --> 00:45:13.209
No, thanks.

825
00:45:13.294 --> 00:45:14.252
Tonight's my night off,

826
00:45:15.672 --> 00:45:16.912
so I just kinda wanna go
home and get some sleep.

827
00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:18.798
Come on, I know the long
nights at the theater

828
00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:20.341
must be pretty lonely.

829
00:45:21.553 --> 00:45:23.261
Come on, I'd really like
to just know you.

830
00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:27.256
Yeah?

831
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.099
You know what, sure.

832
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.101
-I'll see you there.
-Great

833
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:46.442
Hey.

834
00:45:46.536 --> 00:45:47.243
So sorry I'm late.

835
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:51.447
I had to, it doesn't matter.

836
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:53.875
I just, I'm here.

837
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.117
Did you order?

838
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.753
Is everyone else still
on their way?

839
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.298
Right, no, actually.

840
00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:04.677
They decided to stay and
watch the movie.

841
00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:08.014
Pretty sure they're just trying
to be like slick chaperones,

842
00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:10.224
so it's just us.

843
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.644
Oh, well, okay.

844
00:46:13.772 --> 00:46:14.970
That's great though.

845
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:16.981
We can have some good
one on one time.

846
00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.650
Sure.

847
00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:24.864
Mm, thank you.

848
00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:25.698
Enjoy.

849
00:46:27.786 --> 00:46:28.493
Here, have some.

850
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:29.985
Oh no, I'm fine.

851
00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:31.654
I'm allergic to shellfish.

852
00:46:31.748 --> 00:46:34.040
Rosaline and I both
are actually.

853
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.541
I'm sorry, should I not
have ordered this?

854
00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:36.992
Oh no, no, no, it's fine.

855
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:37.877
I just can't have any.

856
00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:40.379
Okay, sorry.

857
00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:46.511
So, how is the theater?

858
00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:48.471
It's fine.

859
00:46:49.724 --> 00:46:51.173
Yeah?

860
00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:51.933
You sure?

861
00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:54.143
What do you mean?

862
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.979
No, I just know

863
00:46:58.316 --> 00:46:59.515
that the theater's had
some financial problems,

864
00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:02.401
and Cameron's messed up
with some bad people,

865
00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:05.738
and I'm just worried about her.

866
00:47:06.825 --> 00:47:07.865
It's fine.

867
00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:09.325
She's fine.

868
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:12.829
Good, 'cause the theater's
been a lifesaver for Jonathan

869
00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:15.706
with the whole divorce.

870
00:47:15.834 --> 00:47:17.032
Yeah.

871
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:18.501
It's been really
helpful with Rosaline

872
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:20.127
and the death of her
father also.

873
00:47:20.797 --> 00:47:22.755
Yeah, you know,

874
00:47:22.841 --> 00:47:26.384
you and I are
actually a lot alike.

875
00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:28.636
You think so?

876
00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:32.306
I don't think we are
very much alike.

877
00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:35.434
Well, we have more in common
than other parents at school.

878
00:47:36.688 --> 00:47:37.228
How so?

879
00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:41.232
Well, you're a widow
and I'm divorced.

880
00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:44.610
We both know what it's like

881
00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:47.280
to lose the life we were
supposed to live.

882
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:50.399
What do you mean by that?

883
00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:53.068
Nevermind, you probably
wouldn't understand.

884
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:54.245
No, no, try me.

885
00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:56.289
I want to understand.

886
00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:58.574
I want to understand you.

887
00:47:58.668 --> 00:48:01.586
Okay, well, I was adopted.

888
00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:05.414
I never really knew my
birth parents,

889
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:09.084
so I don't remember
them or anything,

890
00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:11.012
but my adoptive parents,

891
00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:14.265
they never really cared
about me much.

892
00:48:16.019 --> 00:48:18.427
I wasn't even a kid to them.

893
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:22.565
It was more of a tool
or a pawn really

894
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.693
just to help elevate their
status in life.

895
00:48:26.863 --> 00:48:27.820
That's awful.

896
00:48:27.906 --> 00:48:30.781
Yeah, it was.

897
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.037
I played the role I was
expected to play.

898
00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:37.830
I married my high
school sweetheart,

899
00:48:37.916 --> 00:48:41.125
I had a baby, I stayed home,
all of that.

900
00:48:42.462 --> 00:48:44.795
You know, it was never
like I thought it would be.

901
00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:52.553
But now that's gone, and
now I'm the divorced mom,

902
00:48:53.765 --> 00:48:56.098
and I don't even know what
I'm supposed to do next.

903
00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.136
I know life plans can
change in an instant,

904
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.639
in a fraction of a second,

905
00:49:03.733 --> 00:49:08.069
but you still have time,
don't you?

906
00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:09.478
Oh yeah, time for what?

907
00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:12.648
Time for whatever, anything,

908
00:49:12.742 --> 00:49:14.149
whatever you want to do.

909
00:49:14.243 --> 00:49:15.534
It doesn't matter.

910
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:19.538
It's not like you've
made any huge mistakes.

911
00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:24.377
You still have a chance, right?

912
00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:33.678
I'm gonna use the ladies room.

913
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.860
Cameron, I'm starting my shift.

914
00:49:57.537 --> 00:49:58.327
Cameron?

915
00:50:01.791 --> 00:50:03.374
Oh my god, Cameron!

916
00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:05.292
Oh my god, hold on.

917
00:50:05.378 --> 00:50:07.202
Hold on, I'm gonna
call somebody.

918
00:50:07.296 --> 00:50:08.462
You're gonna be okay, okay?

919
00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:12.717
Anything else
you can tell me?

920
00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:13.759
No.

921
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:16.095
All right, I'll check
with the daytime guard

922
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.388
and see what else I can
get from them.

923
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.598
We don't have a daytime
security guard, just me.

924
00:50:21.144 --> 00:50:22.059
Financial--

925
00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:23.728
Troubles, I got that.

926
00:50:23.855 --> 00:50:27.106
I have to see if Cameron
has any family to call.

927
00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:30.192
I can't believe the cameras
were disconnected again.

928
00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:31.902
Don't beat yourself up.

929
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.563
Cameron may have done
that on purpose.

930
00:50:34.657 --> 00:50:36.115
We received an anonymous tip

931
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.567
that a valuable baton
had been stolen

932
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:40.911
from a resident
across the street.

933
00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:42.404
Stolen?

934
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:44.915
That may have been what
you saw that night,

935
00:50:45.043 --> 00:50:45.708
Cameron breaking in.

936
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:48.711
We think she took it to
cover her debts.

937
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.748
You really think she stole it?

938
00:50:52.842 --> 00:50:54.592
We'll do some further
investigation.

939
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.178
I'll see myself out.

940
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.795
Celine Russell?

941
00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:16.215
I'm a private investigator.

942
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.833
Your family hired me.

943
00:52:17.927 --> 00:52:20.052
They just wanna make
sure you're okay.

944
00:52:20.138 --> 00:52:20.678
My family?

945
00:52:22.974 --> 00:52:26.684
Yeah, I guess they would be a
little worried, but I'm fine.

946
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:27.726
You can tell them that.

947
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:30.271
They didn't need to hire
a private investigator.

948
00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:32.064
Well, they're more than a
little worried.

949
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.483
I think if you told them
yourself that you're okay,

950
00:52:34.569 --> 00:52:35.609
it would go a long way.

951
00:52:36.946 --> 00:52:38.904
They just wanna know
what's going on with you.

952
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:41.866
Nothing's going on with me.

953
00:52:41.993 --> 00:52:45.411
I just don't wanna
talk with them.

954
00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:46.745
They should respect that.

955
00:52:47.832 --> 00:52:50.624
Well, they're concerned.

956
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.919
Your father gave me a message
to pass on if I saw you.

957
00:52:55.214 --> 00:52:57.047
He doesn't understand why you
quit your job at the hospital,

958
00:52:57.175 --> 00:52:59.633
but said, if you need money,
you can always come to him.

959
00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:02.928
How nice of him.

960
00:53:03.014 --> 00:53:05.714
Well, no one's heard from
you in a month.

961
00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:08.809
Surely, you can see why they
may wonder what's going on.

962
00:53:08.895 --> 00:53:11.645
If you're unhappy or hurt,

963
00:53:11.731 --> 00:53:13.314
there are people who
want to help.

964
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:16.192
Well, I'm fine.

965
00:53:18.404 --> 00:53:19.945
You're an investigator.

966
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:20.654
You found me.

967
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:22.781
Your job's done.

968
00:53:24.744 --> 00:53:27.036
I do have one last
message from your family.

969
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:31.290
Your mother told me to
ask you if I found you

970
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.742
if all of this has anything
to do with your sister?

971
00:53:33.836 --> 00:53:35.461
I said, I'm fine, all right?

972
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.338
I just don't wanna talk to them.

973
00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:39.924
They should respect
that and so should you.

974
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:42.084
Look, I don't know why
you're angry with them.

975
00:53:42.178 --> 00:53:43.928
Maybe you have a good reason,

976
00:53:44.055 --> 00:53:46.639
but if you cut yourself
off from your family,

977
00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:48.390
be certain that's really
what you want.

978
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:53.354
That wound takes a long
time to heal.

979
00:53:57.443 --> 00:53:59.401
That's none of your business.

980
00:54:01.197 --> 00:54:03.781
The next time I see you,
I'm gonna call the cops.

981
00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:08.202
-I understand.
-Yeah, great.

982
00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:42.736
What did you wanna
talk to me about?

983
00:54:42.822 --> 00:54:44.238
Said you needed my help
with something.

984
00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:52.821
Did it have something to
do with the light

985
00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:54.707
that came crashing down?

986
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:55.991
Not exactly.

987
00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:56.834
Maybe.

988
00:54:58.421 --> 00:55:02.339
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

989
00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:04.383
Isabel, no, of course
you should have.

990
00:55:04.468 --> 00:55:05.843
What's wrong?

991
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.846
I'm sorry, this was a mistake.

992
00:55:08.973 --> 00:55:11.181
I'll see you at the fundraiser,
okay?

993
00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:37.249
Oh, there's Jonathan, and
Therese, and everyone.

994
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.793
He looks so cute.

995
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.045
Go have fun, honey.

996
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.463
I'll talk to you later.

997
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:43.964
All right, I'll see you
when the auction starts.

998
00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:45.090
As long as you don't expect me

999
00:55:46.594 --> 00:55:47.676
to buy you one of those
expensive aromatherapy baskets.

1000
00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:48.594
-Just one.
-I love you, but not that much.

1001
00:55:57.772 --> 00:55:58.604
Hey, Isabel.

1002
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.689
Hey, Sharon.

1003
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:03.609
You know where the bathroom is?

1004
00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:05.310
I've never been here before,
but I just saw Megan.

1005
00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:06.111
Let me go look.

1006
00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:07.363
Oh no, no, no.

1007
00:56:07.448 --> 00:56:08.155
She's probably hosting.

1008
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:09.782
I'll find it myself.

1009
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:10.616
Okay.

1010
00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:03.869
What are you doing?

1011
00:57:03.963 --> 00:57:06.547
Henry, hi.

1012
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.541
Am I interrupting?

1013
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:16.140
Oh, Megan asked me to come
here and look for something.

1014
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:21.437
Celebrity headshots
for the auction.

1015
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:23.856
Oh, I wasn't aware that
Megan collected headshots.

1016
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:24.982
Yeah.

1017
00:57:26.235 --> 00:57:29.778
Yeah, her ex-husband's
cousin was a collector

1018
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:33.240
and they got all of her
things before she died.

1019
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:37.077
Huh, that's very generous of
her to donate to the auction.

1020
00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:38.078
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:40.414
What are you doing here?

1022
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.791
Oh, came to drop off my coat.

1023
00:57:42.877 --> 00:57:44.293
Can I help you look?

1024
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:46.128
Oh no, you don't have to.

1025
00:57:46.213 --> 00:57:47.379
No, I insist.

1026
00:57:47.465 --> 00:57:48.547
You don't need to do it
all by yourself.

1027
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:50.299
Oh, it's fine.

1028
00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:50.966
I got it really.

1029
00:57:53.596 --> 00:57:54.753
Megan, are you in here?

1030
00:57:54.847 --> 00:57:56.180
Oh no.

1031
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:01.560
Oh, hi.

1032
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:04.897
Hi, Kim, Mrs. Bradford.

1033
00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:07.816
You can call me Kim.

1034
00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:09.485
It's okay, Mr. Cho.

1035
00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:10.986
Sorry to interrupt.

1036
00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:12.529
I was looking for Megan.

1037
00:58:12.615 --> 00:58:14.272
She's not here.

1038
00:58:14.366 --> 00:58:15.407
I can see that.

1039
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:19.912
Well, I'll leave you
two to it then.

1040
00:58:24.168 --> 00:58:24.958
What was that?

1041
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.963
I misled you about why I'm here.

1042
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.215
Misled?

1043
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.049
You mean lied.

1044
00:58:33.302 --> 00:58:34.801
Isabel, what's really
going on here?

1045
00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:39.264
Remember when I told you
I thought I saw a murder?

1046
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:43.727
Well, Cameron's involved
and I think Megan is too,

1047
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:47.814
but I'm not sure if it was
a murder or something else.

1048
00:58:50.444 --> 00:58:52.477
You think I'm crazy?

1049
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:56.740
No, Megan's been acting
really strange lately.

1050
00:58:56.825 --> 00:58:58.825
Something's up with her,
I know it.

1051
00:58:59.662 --> 00:59:00.953
But why would she do this?

1052
00:59:02.122 --> 00:59:06.625
Oh, she's involved in
Cameron's money troubles,

1053
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:10.003
but I'm not sure how yet.

1054
00:59:12.258 --> 00:59:14.174
I tried to get into her
apartment the other day,

1055
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:17.886
but she was there so I'm
looking for evidence here.

1056
00:59:20.474 --> 00:59:21.265
You know what?

1057
00:59:24.144 --> 00:59:25.602
How can I help?

1058
00:59:26.438 --> 00:59:27.479
Check that box.

1059
00:59:50.296 --> 00:59:50.794
Megan?

1060
00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:54.923
You know, I think we
need more grapes.

1061
00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:56.049
Do you have some more?

1062
00:59:57.136 --> 00:59:58.302
Of course.

1063
00:59:58.387 --> 01:00:00.846
-Let me get that for you.
-Okay.

1064
01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:03.223
What are we even looking for?

1065
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.060
I don't know.
Maybe it's just a fools errand.

1066
01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:14.901
Megan and Celine reunited
after all this time?

1067
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.238
Who's Celine?

1068
01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.240
And why is her half missing?

1069
01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:27.831
-Call 9-1-1!
-Oh my gosh, Rosaline!

1070
01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:38.917
She just collapsed
all of a sudden.

1071
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.969
I don't know what happened.

1072
01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:49.478
It's all right, it's okay,
it's okay.

1073
01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.438
It's okay, you're okay.

1074
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.106
Come on, okay, okay.

1075
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.276
Will Rosaline be okay?

1076
01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.112
For now, but epinephrine
is only temporary

1077
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:00.939
so I have to get her to the
hospital before it wears off.

1078
01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.282
Are you okay to walk?

1079
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.950
Okay, come on.
Come on.

1080
01:01:18.217 --> 01:01:19.132
Is your daughter all right?

1081
01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:20.467
She's fine.

1082
01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.928
We're waiting on some
labs to be processed.

1083
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:23.970
Ms. Richardson, if--

1084
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.514
Megan Everett
poisoned my daughter.

1085
01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:29.351
Rosaline has a deadly
allergy and she knew it.

1086
01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:30.936
That's a serious accusation.

1087
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.480
You how easily
cross-contamination can spread.

1088
01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.608
What's your daughter
allergic to, milk, nuts?

1089
01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.276
Shellfish.

1090
01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.405
I picked the food and made sure
there were none on the menu.

1091
01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:44.899
Look, I don't expect
you to take it on faith,

1092
01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:47.953
but I made everything
except these.

1093
01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.329
Those were Megan.

1094
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.667
If you test one, I'm sure
you'll find shellfish residue.

1095
01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.210
Even if I find traces
of shellfish,

1096
01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:57.078
it could be a coincidence.

1097
01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.581
Just run the test please.

1098
01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:02.801
Ms. Richardson, we just can't
run lab tests on a whim.

1099
01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.928
Do you have kids, Detective?

1100
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.265
I have a daughter, Claire.

1101
01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.642
How would you feel if
someone tried to hurt Claire?

1102
01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.145
What would you do?

1103
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.856
I wouldn't rest until I
was sure she was safe.

1104
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.899
I know it's a big ask.

1105
01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:20.101
If the tests turn up nothing,

1106
01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:23.029
I'll stop bothering you
about all of it,

1107
01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:24.948
but I have to keep
Rosaline safe.

1108
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.493
I'll see what I can do.

1109
01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:35.625
Look, I'm not supposed to talk
about ongoing investigations,

1110
01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.754
but we found the loan shark.

1111
01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.007
It turns out Cameron
paid in full,

1112
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.008
so whoever harmed her,

1113
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:44.885
it must have been for
another reason.

1114
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.628
How much did she owe them?

1115
01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:47.721
Around 30,000.

1116
01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.182
But like I said, she paid it.

1117
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.811
I'll let you know about
those test results.

1118
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.368
Henry, over here.

1119
01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.746
What are we doing?

1120
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.748
I don't want anyone to see us.

1121
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.249
I got that.

1122
01:03:16.877 --> 01:03:19.127
Thanks for playing
hooky from work.

1123
01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.796
You said you needed my help.

1124
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.299
Is Rosaline okay?

1125
01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:26.843
She's fine.

1126
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.930
She's just afraid she
lost her cool girl cred.

1127
01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.348
She went to school,

1128
01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.016
but I can't promise
she's actually in class

1129
01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.768
and not hiding under
the bleachers.

1130
01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.686
No, the kids love her.

1131
01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.188
I'm sure it'll take more
than last night

1132
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.981
to knock her off her pedestal.

1133
01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.608
You okay?

1134
01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:45.153
I'm fine, I'm just tired.

1135
01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:47.489
I was up all night at
the hospital.

1136
01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:48.740
Any idea what happened?

1137
01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:52.452
I think Megan poisoned Rosaline.

1138
01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:53.286
You what?

1139
01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:54.621
So I have to figure out

1140
01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:55.956
how to get into that
apartment building

1141
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.249
and find the evidence.

1142
01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.918
Hold on there, "Rear Window."

1143
01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.586
Are we breaking in?

1144
01:04:01.672 --> 01:04:02.587
If you don't wanna help me--

1145
01:04:02.673 --> 01:04:04.548
I didn't say that.

1146
01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:09.469
Look, I saw what happened
last night just like you did.

1147
01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.055
I'm convinced there's
something strange

1148
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.181
going on around here.

1149
01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.978
I can't pick the lock to
the front door,

1150
01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.188
so we have to wait till
someone comes outside.

1151
01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.399
Like him?

1152
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.790
I thought you said you
couldn't pick locks.

1153
01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:41.576
Just the front ones of
the building.

1154
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.503
I may have watched a
lot of online tutorials

1155
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:44.379
on how to pick locks.

1156
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.049
Got it.

1157
01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.303
Impressive.
Internet's finest.

1158
01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.521
I'll check in here.
You can check down there.

1159
01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:46.775
Celine?

1160
01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:51.488
Isabel, I think I
found something.

1161
01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.497
This must be Celine.

1162
01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.501
So there were two people in
the apartment that night?

1163
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.217
Is something wrong?

1164
01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.843
It's Detective Novac.

1165
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:16.680
He had the brownies that
Rosaline ate last night tested

1166
01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.264
and he just told me that
the results came back

1167
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:20.684
positive for glucosamine powder,

1168
01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:22.310
which is made with shellfish.

1169
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.607
It's a joint supplement,
not a baking ingredient.

1170
01:06:27.693 --> 01:06:29.734
That has to have been
added on purpose.

1171
01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.194
If she did that to Rosaline.

1172
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.910
This curtain, it's new.

1173
01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:41.746
Why would she redecorate

1174
01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.916
if she wasn't planning
on coming back?

1175
01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.377
Because the original
curtain was the perfect size

1176
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.922
to wrap up a body.

1177
01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:56.636
We should go.

1178
01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.055
Good call.

1179
01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.363
Where's my phone?

1180
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.282
I must have left it.

1181
01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.242
Stay here, I'll be right back.

1182
01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:20.735
Henry, wait--

1183
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:22.412
Wait, wait, ah!

1184
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.582
Henry, oh my god!

1185
01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.096
9-1-1, I need an ambulance.

1186
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.270
Where were you?

1187
01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.938
I called you like 10 times!

1188
01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:50.482
I had to get a ride with
Therese and her mom.

1189
01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.150
Rosaline, you might
wanna sit for this.

1190
01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:52.984
Okay.

1191
01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:58.106
You'll probably hear about
this at school,

1192
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.241
but I want you to hear it
from me first.

1193
01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:04.245
Mr. Cho is in a coma.

1194
01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.417
Is he gonna be okay?

1195
01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:12.504
The doctors aren't sure when
he'll regain consciousness

1196
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.672
or if he ever will.

1197
01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:15.632
That's horrible.

1198
01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.676
First, your boss and now Mr.
Cho.

1199
01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:22.971
Wait, how do you know about
Mr. Cho being in a coma?

1200
01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:25.683
Well, Henry and I.

1201
01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:27.185
Henry and I?

1202
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.978
What's going on between you two?

1203
01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:30.313
We'll talk about that later.

1204
01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.234
For now, there have been some
strange things going on lately

1205
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.861
and I don't wanna have to
tell you this,

1206
01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:38.363
but I think it's Jonathan's mom.

1207
01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:44.243
I believe she's behind this,

1208
01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.745
your anaphylactic shock,

1209
01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.413
and even the light falling from
the ceiling in the theater.

1210
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.582
That's crazy.

1211
01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.334
Yeah, I know it's a lot

1212
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.252
and I don't wanna have
to suggest this,

1213
01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.380
but I think you should
avoid Jonathan for a bit,

1214
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.048
just until things
straighten out.

1215
01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:58.716
Are you kidding me?

1216
01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.760
Is this still about me
seeing Jonathan?

1217
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.011
Rosaline, of course not.

1218
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.348
No, no, no, you're crazy.

1219
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.975
That's crazy.

1220
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.518
I told you, I told you
that all those energy shots

1221
01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.560
were bad for you.

1222
01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:11.354
They scrambled your brain
up or something.

1223
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:12.147
Well, hold on now.

1224
01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.566
No, you're telling me
that my boyfriend's mom

1225
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.067
tried to kill me and the
theater director?

1226
01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.194
Mom, that's nuts!

1227
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:19.362
What's her motive?

1228
01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.988
Why would she have
done any of this?

1229
01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:23.408
Well, she's after me
specifically.

1230
01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.576
Why, what did you do?

1231
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:25.910
I didn't do anything,

1232
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:31.875
but I believe she
killed somebody

1233
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:34.877
and I saw it happen.

1234
01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:38.089
No, I don't believe you.

1235
01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.968
You're hallucinating,

1236
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.304
sleepwalking like you
did right after dad died.

1237
01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.846
And you're doing it again, mom,

1238
01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.057
ruining my life with your
overactive imagination.

1239
01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:49.267
And if dad were still here--

1240
01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:50.475
Rosaline, that's enough.

1241
01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.888
I know your father isn't here

1242
01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:55.231
and I wish every day
that he was,

1243
01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.150
but I can't bring him back.

1244
01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:01.654
All I can do is try to
keep you safe,

1245
01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:08.077
so I'm asking, stay away
from Megan and Jonathan.

1246
01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.495
Okay?

1247
01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.723
Rosaline, I made you
dinner if you're hungry.

1248
01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.185
Rosaline?

1249
01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:39.100
I'm really sorry about all this,
honey.

1250
01:10:39.194 --> 01:10:40.652
I think we just need
to stay away

1251
01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:41.986
from the Everetts for a bit.

1252
01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.283
Rosaline, if you don't
wanna talk to me,

1253
01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.368
you don't have to,

1254
01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:50.161
but at least come out
and get something to eat.

1255
01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.498
All right, I'm coming in

1256
01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.976
Rosaline, honey, I know
you're mad at me,

1257
01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:14.894
but you can't just sneak out.

1258
01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.304
Hello, Isabel.

1259
01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:17.146
Megan?

1260
01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:19.524
What did you do to my daughter?

1261
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.193
Oh, oh, do
you wanna know?

1262
01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.653
Don't you hurt her.

1263
01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.906
We're at the theater.

1264
01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:27.824
Come alone.

1265
01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.268
Rosaline, Rosaline, oh my god.

1266
01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.813
I'm gonna get you out of here,
honey.

1267
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.023
I'm gonna get you out.

1268
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.067
Where's Megan?

1269
01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:46.235
What? What?

1270
01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:47.695
Mom, she's behind you!

1271
01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:52.575
Mom, mom, no, mom!

1272
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.619
No, what are you doing, mom?

1273
01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:55.453
No!

1274
01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.045
Please wake up, please wake up.

1275
01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:09.425
Baby, did she hurt you?

1276
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.802
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1277
01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.887
Mom, I'm so sorry.

1278
01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.264
Mom, she texted me from
Jonathan's phone.

1279
01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.974
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1280
01:13:24.818 --> 01:13:27.276
Just had to make sure you
didn't bring anyone with you.

1281
01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.237
Well, I didn't want you
to hurt my daughter.

1282
01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:32.490
Well, I didn't wanna hurt
your daughter either,

1283
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:36.160
but unfortunately, here we are.

1284
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:44.210
What are you gonna do?

1285
01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:47.130
Oh, are you scared?

1286
01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:49.966
Does this scare you?

1287
01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.468
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna kill you with these.

1288
01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:53.386
That's ridiculous.

1289
01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:55.555
I have a better idea.

1290
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.474
Imagine the headlines,

1291
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:02.520
security guard and her daughter
parish in a tragic fire

1292
01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.605
at the historic Regent Theater.

1293
01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:08.860
Consider how old the wiring
is, I think it's pretty smart.

1294
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.153
Don't you?

1295
01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:14.490
Ms. Everett, please don't
do this, please don't.

1296
01:14:14.576 --> 01:14:17.994
Oh, Rosaline, Rosaline.

1297
01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:22.748
Please believe me when I tell
you I don't want to do this,

1298
01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:27.879
but your mom just wouldn't
stop even after I warned her,

1299
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.922
even after I got rid
of the security tapes,

1300
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.174
even after I got rid of Cameron.

1301
01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:32.967
She just wouldn't let it go.

1302
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.053
So you did hurt Cameron?

1303
01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.099
You're the one who hit
me in the head

1304
01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.225
and trashed the office.

1305
01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:45.146
But how did you break in?

1306
01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:49.025
No, you didn't.

1307
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.945
You have a key to the theater.

1308
01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.364
Henry told me how helpful you
were with the theater club

1309
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.116
when Mr. Branson was head.

1310
01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.618
That's pretty much the one thing

1311
01:14:58.745 --> 01:15:00.277
that being a suburban
housewife taught me

1312
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.580
is to use your connections.

1313
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.125
You know what?
Let's just get this over with.

1314
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.126
I'm tired

1315
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:11.172
and I'm gonna have a long day
tomorrow consoling Jonathan.

1316
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:16.460
Please don't do this,
please don't do this.

1317
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.514
I don't have a choice.

1318
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.433
It's too late.

1319
01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:23.559
It's too late for what?

1320
01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:29.649
I know you killed someone.

1321
01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:31.317
Celine.

1322
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:33.819
That was her name, right?

1323
01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.115
But why, what happened?

1324
01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:42.620
Why did you kill her, Megan?

1325
01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:45.540
Oh my god, you just
have to know, don't you?

1326
01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:46.916
You just have to know.

1327
01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:56.342
She was my sister, my twin
sister, Celine Russell.

1328
01:15:57.679 --> 01:16:00.638
God, what a stupid rich
person name, right?

1329
01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.519
We were adopted out separately.

1330
01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:09.272
You know, I didn't even know
I had a sister most of my life

1331
01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:12.108
Until I met Cameron.

1332
01:16:12.986 --> 01:16:15.686
And then she told me
about a woman

1333
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.699
who lived across the street
that looked exactly like me.

1334
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.870
We were so excited to
meet each other.

1335
01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:29.750
We'd been living in
the same city for years

1336
01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:30.835
and we didn't even know.

1337
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:38.551
That night, she invited
me over for dinner.

1338
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:41.846
She wanted to brag

1339
01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.725
about how she just passed
her medical license exam.

1340
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:49.895
Now, she was Dr. Celine Russell.

1341
01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:50.771
Woo.

1342
01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:55.234
Gosh, she was always
doing things like that,

1343
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.903
always rubbing it in my face,

1344
01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.905
always bragging about
how perfect her life was,

1345
01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:04.201
but she said she wanted to
celebrate her accomplishments

1346
01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:05.578
with her sister.

1347
01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.416
A bunch of garbage.

1348
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:14.587
She had all these fancy
things, fancy friends,

1349
01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:18.424
people who actually
cared about her.

1350
01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:22.428
And now, she had a
fancy new career.

1351
01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:29.760
She had such an
interesting life,

1352
01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:32.271
stories to tell about how
she traveled the world

1353
01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.523
and rubbed elbows with
the social elite.

1354
01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:37.193
And I had none of that.

1355
01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:42.615
All I had was a jerk
ex-husband, an annoying son,

1356
01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:44.441
and a circle of fake friends

1357
01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:47.787
that will laugh about me behind
my back any chance they get.

1358
01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:50.114
Was that all I had to
show for my life

1359
01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.707
because I did what was
expected of me

1360
01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.626
and Celine didn't?

1361
01:17:53.753 --> 01:17:59.123
And then, oh, and then
she had the nerve to say,

1362
01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:02.885
"I can't believe how
perfect my life is.

1363
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.595
I'm so lucky."

1364
01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:12.061
I didn't mean to kill her.

1365
01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:14.605
I snapped.

1366
01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:26.325
It was a split second decision

1367
01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.703
that I will carry around
for the rest of my life,

1368
01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:34.825
but I couldn't stand to see
the smug look on Celine's face,

1369
01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.002
not for one more second!

1370
01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:41.298
Jonathan?

1371
01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:45.669
I was just looking for my phone.

1372
01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.388
I thought I left it
here earlier.

1373
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.309
You killed someone.

1374
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.179
Jonathan, let me explain.

1375
01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:56.147
Just listen.

1376
01:18:57.275 --> 01:18:57.648
And now, you're trying
to kill them.

1377
01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:01.018
Baby, I have to.

1378
01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:01.694
They know what I did.

1379
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.869
I won't let you.

1380
01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.705
I'm sorry, I have to.

1381
01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.365
-No, mom, stop.

1382
01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.042
I'm so sorry.

1383
01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:51.902
I didn't mean to kill Celine.

1384
01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.120
I'm sorry.

1385
01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.247
It doesn't matter if you
meant to do it,

1386
01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.499
you killed someone.

1387
01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.169
You heard her, boys.

1388
01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:02.338
Megan Everett, you're
under arrest for murder.

1389
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.261
Glad you could make it.

1390
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:17.937
Jonathan.

1391
01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:21.482
Jonathan.

1392
01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:22.566
Jonathan, look at me.

1393
01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.694
You were right
about one thing.

1394
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.406
You will carry this for
the rest of your life.

1395
01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:43.963
So, how was school?

1396
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:45.297
Fine.

1397
01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:48.300
Mr. Henry announced the
spring musical.

1398
01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:49.802
I can't believe you talked
him into "The Music Man."

1399
01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:50.719
So corny.

1400
01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:52.847
Hey, I'm managing the Regent

1401
01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:55.349
now that Cameron's in
physical therapy.

1402
01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.301
Well, I'm so grateful she
gave me this opportunity.

1403
01:20:57.395 --> 01:21:01.138
No more overnights and
no more energy drinks.

1404
01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:02.806
But why do you even like
"The Music Man?"

1405
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:06.977
Excuse me, it's a classic
and it's Cameron's favorite.

1406
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.646
I told Henry that the school
was gonna be renting the space,

1407
01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.815
it has to be "The Music Man."

1408
01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.158
And I wanted to do
something nice for Cameron

1409
01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:14.243
for when she's back.

1410
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.247
Wait a minute, wait, wait,
wait, what's up with all this?

1411
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:20.157
What?

1412
01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:21.491
You're just smiling
and cheesing.

1413
01:21:21.586 --> 01:21:21.959
No, I'm not.

1414
01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:27.965
Jonathan's moving back.

1415
01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:31.886
I mean, and we can be together

1416
01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.346
if that's okay with you though.

1417
01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:37.850
Hey, Jonathan's worst
influence is behind bars,

1418
01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:39.810
so I'd say I'm fine with that.

1419
01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:44.848
And hey, maybe we can
all go on a double date.

1420
01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.850
Mom, I'm not gonna go on
a double date with you,

1421
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.694
my English teacher, and
my boyfriend.

1422
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.738
No, no way, that's annoying.

1423
01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.689
Wow, thanks.

1424
01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:58.370
But I'm glad you're my
mom, even through it all.

1425
01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:02.082
Even when you told me
I'm ruining your life?

1426
01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.000
Even then.

1427
01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.503
You know, other people
aren't so lucky, so.

1428
01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:07.546
No, they're not.

1429
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.173
And I won't let you forget it.

1430
01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:12.468
Yuck.

1431
01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:13.093
Love you too, mom.

1432
01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:15.971
All right, let's go.
