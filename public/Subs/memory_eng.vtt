1
00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:30.370
Oh, sh.. Shit!

2
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.907
You are, uh, nervous.

3
00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:09.510
It's okay.

4
00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:12.379
When I first saw you,
I said to myself,

5
00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.582
"This is a man that knows
what he wants."

6
00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.087
He's just, uh, afraid.

7
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:21.689
Well, I'm not afraid,
it's just that I..

8
00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:24.725
I know, I know,
It.. It is just the way...

9
00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.094
things are.

10
00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:30.097
But a man must pay
to get what he wants.

11
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.464
Hmm?

12
00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:38.539
That is why...
we're all here, yes?

13
00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.547
Yeah.

14
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.855
Go talk to her.

15
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.457
Come on.

16
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.062
She's very sweet.

17
00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:02.697
You'll see.

18
00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:24.918
Beatriz!

19
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:36.030
<i>Hola.</i>

20
00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:37.531
Hi.

21
00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.469
You wanna show me
what you're drawing?

22
00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:45.506
I'd rather not.

23
00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:54.882
It's Beatriz, right?

24
00:06:58.052 --> 00:06:59.052
Bedroom.

25
00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:15.069
Ah, li.. Listen, why, wh..
Why don't we just talk first?

26
00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.504
Okay?

27
00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:18.115
You don't want to waste
time with talking.

28
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.074
It's okay.

29
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.809
H.. How old are you?

30
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.077
How old do you like?

31
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.612
No, that's not what I meant.

32
00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.580
I just want to get to know you,

33
00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:27.891
G.. G.. Get to know who you are.

34
00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:29.617
- You like thirteen?
- Come on, no, please!

35
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.519
- Twelve?
- No.

36
00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:37.558
Shit!

37
00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.061
Papa! Papa!

38
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.974
FBI! Drop the gun
right now, asshole! Drop it!

39
00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:56.043
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you too, pal!

40
00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:58.212
- I die, she dies.
- Hey, Leon!

41
00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:09.857
Put the gun down. Put it down!

42
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.268
Nobody said anything
about going back.

43
00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:12.994
We can talk about all that,

44
00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:14.595
when everybody's safe, okay?

45
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.731
You've lied! You all lied!

46
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:19.567
You don't want to hurt her, man.
She's your daughter.

47
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.003
- Okay? She needs you.
- You don't know shit.

48
00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.604
I know you don't want this.

49
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:26.007
None of us wants this, okay?

50
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.274
Come on, you're a father.

51
00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:29.276
Put the gun down.

52
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:37.018
Papa! Papa!

53
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.955
Papa!

54
00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:42.155
Papa!

55
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.624
- Let go of me!
- Beatriz, no.

56
00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.726
- Come on, get back!
- Papa! Papa!

57
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.828
- Get her back!
- Let go!

58
00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:49.130
Papa!

59
00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:50.163
Let go!

60
00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:04.078
Papa Leon?

61
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.648
Yeah, I, uh..

62
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.984
Hold on, Serra, I wanna
make sure I'm clear on this.

63
00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.086
The lynchpin, the key
to your whole investigation

64
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.197
is laying in a meat wagon
with his brains smashed in?

65
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.058
Vincent saved lives, sir.
The fucker was going out messy.

66
00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:18.659
I don't care, Amistead.

67
00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:20.861
What I care about,
is an eleven month investigation

68
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:22.663
that has taken
considerable resources

69
00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:23.998
on both sides of the border.

70
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.834
- Is now well and truly fucked.
- Not necessarily.

71
00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.769
Don't add insult to injury.

72
00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:30.671
An undocumented child
is not something

73
00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.306
we build a trafficking case on.

74
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.075
Well, what the fuck is?

75
00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:35.242
Sir.

76
00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:36.677
We'll talk in the morning.

77
00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:38.072
Mauricio.

78
00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:42.376
Alex!

79
00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:46.380
What's this? What's this?

80
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:53.154
Oh, my God, has she grown!

81
00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:54.855
- Hmm.
- What a sweet kid!

82
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:59.160
Ah, Pinches horses... expensive.

83
00:10:59.193 --> 00:11:01.395
- Less than a divorce, I guess.
- Yeah!

84
00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.301
Nice work in Guadalajara.

85
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.037
That city is a fucking shithole.

86
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.338
Same as here.

87
00:11:11.372 --> 00:11:13.007
I hate cities, the crowds,

88
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.176
the smells, the fucking <i>gueros.</i>

89
00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:19.046
- No offense.
- None taken.

90
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.282
Country's better now,
don't you think?

91
00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:23.317
Remember Tamalpais?

92
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.320
Those were Zeta scumbags.

93
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.756
Crazy days.
Fun though, huh?

94
00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:31.458
Uh, not exactly my idea
of fun, Mauricio.

95
00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:33.727
Right...

96
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:36.130
You're sensitive. An <i>artista.</i>

97
00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:38.432
Jesus. Cheer up!

98
00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.334
Life is good now. It's calmer.

99
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.969
More money, less blood.

100
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.773
Our friends got you
something nice.

101
00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:50.377
Mauri, you want someone else.

102
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:52.446
I'm not up for it right now.

103
00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.014
Get up for it.

104
00:11:54.048 --> 00:11:56.083
Job's in El Paso.
You're from there, right?

105
00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.485
Another reason to say no.

106
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.121
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm getting out.

107
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.201
Uh, an iced tea, <i>por favor.</i>

108
00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:23.844
The fuck?

109
00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:25.946
You drunk?

110
00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:31.085
U.. Uh, no, no, just tired.

111
00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:35.523
Alex. I need you on this.

112
00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:37.157
You know the town.

113
00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:42.263
It's too much.

114
00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:44.031
The job is for two.

115
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.334
Don't you have
a brother in El Paso?

116
00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:54.174
Mauri...

117
00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.545
Are you spying on me?

118
00:12:57.579 --> 00:12:59.913
It's our job
to know things, Alex.

119
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:02.883
So stop talking this
retirement shit.

120
00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:05.754
Men like us don't retire.

121
00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.518
Here you go
Mr. Marshall, you're all set.

122
00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:13.153
Anything else I can do for you?

123
00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:14.188
Mr. Marshall?

124
00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:20.861
No, no, thank you. I'm fine.

125
00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:23.230
The room number again?

126
00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:25.466
11-0-6. It's on the key holder.

127
00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:28.268
Ah, yes. Thank you.

128
00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.039
Vodka Martini, please.

129
00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:11.412
So, too early in the day
for a glass of wine?

130
00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.681
Or too late for a Bloody Mary?

131
00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:15.583
Guess that depends
on what kind of day

132
00:15:15.617 --> 00:15:17.017
you wanna have.

133
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.653
That's up to you, isn't it?

134
00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:25.560
Are you alone?

135
00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:27.294
Not right now.

136
00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:28.630
Excuse me.

137
00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.304
- Pleasant trip?
- Let's get on with it.

138
00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:44.311
Uh, yes, he's here.

139
00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:48.382
He looks like what you'd expect.

140
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:50.083
I'm sure he'll be fine.

141
00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:52.953
Alright. Bye now.

142
00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.330
Your people said
this will be done quickly.

143
00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.032
And it will.

144
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:09.002
I'm gonna need a little more
specificity than that.

145
00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.705
No, you won't.

146
00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:12.507
The less you know, the better.

147
00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:22.676
I was trying to save him.

148
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.411
You are a liar.

149
00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.580
Look, Beatriz,
what happened to you.

150
00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:29.216
What Papa did, it ain't right.

151
00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:30.518
Now, it's not your fault.

152
00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:32.095
- No child should be treated..
- Papa said...

153
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.656
"It is how you pay to be free."

154
00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:36.624
It was better than here.

155
00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.599
- I brought you these.
- I don't want them!

156
00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:51.371
Listen, there is, uh,

157
00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:54.174
a special visa for...
people like you

158
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:55.886
to stay in the US,
while we're working on your...

159
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.277
You want me to tell.

160
00:17:57.311 --> 00:17:59.313
It's wrong that you're
locked up here

161
00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:01.315
while the men who did
things to you are out there.

162
00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:02.817
Papa said to never tell.

163
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.290
I'm gonna have you transferred

164
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:13.160
to Child Protective Services,
okay?

165
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.597
They'll put you in a group home.
Not lock you up.

166
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.865
Now, I don't expect anything
in return.

167
00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:19.433
Okay, if you wanna talk,
you can talk.

168
00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:21.234
If you don't wanna,
you don't have to.

169
00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:39.621
Looks like I'm going solo
tonight.

170
00:18:39.654 --> 00:18:41.421
I gotta get this done.

171
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.157
I've got a permit filing
downtown.

172
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:46.426
- Downtown?
- Yeah, I work, Wendy.

173
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.896
Contracts don't just
jump in the boat.

174
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.899
- Don't wait up for me.
- Ellis?

175
00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:55.637
- Yeah?
- Her perfume fucking stinks.

176
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.606
Wash it off before you
come home, will you?

177
00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:17.357
Oh, shit!

178
00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:24.431
Please!

179
00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:27.334
- Please!
- You know why I'm here!

180
00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.836
It's.. It's all
a misunderstanding.

181
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.605
It's always a misunderstanding.

182
00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:31.839
- M.. Please!
- Where?

183
00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:36.276
It's.. It's in the safe.
Upstairs. Please!

184
00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.645
Don't do this!

185
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:41.248
I didn't, I didn't
say anything, alright?

186
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.960
It wasn't, it wasn't
supposed to go this far.

187
00:19:42.984 --> 00:19:45.385
If I'm here, it's gone too far.

188
00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:48.221
It's here, alright! Okay!

189
00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:49.824
- Okay.
- Open it!

190
00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.893
Alright, I just... Okay.

191
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:01.736
Look, if I give it to you..

192
00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:03.403
- Come on!
- Alright.

193
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.842
Oh, Dad? You home?

194
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.978
I'm going over to Annabelle's.

195
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.583
I'll probably stay over, okay?

196
00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:19.286
Just letting you know.

197
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.943
Maybe you want to do that later.

198
00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.477
Uh-huh, I'm multi-tasking.

199
00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.048
Yeah, well I just
don't wanna die today.

200
00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.265
How can you live in Texas
and not speak Spanish?

201
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.626
Fucking owl!

202
00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:17.138
Hey, Danny. Where is he?

203
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:19.439
Besides stomping
all over my crime scene?

204
00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:20.541
He's out there.

205
00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:34.622
Agent Serra, Agent Amistead,
this is Mrs. Van Camp.

206
00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:42.096
Wendy, I guarantee
these are two of my best.

207
00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:44.431
Just tell them what you told me.

208
00:22:46.667 --> 00:22:47.768
Ellis was...

209
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.872
It was a robbery.

210
00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:52.607
The safe was opened.

211
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.576
And you've told this
to Detective Mora?

212
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.879
I haven't talked to the police.

213
00:22:57.912 --> 00:22:59.780
I called Gerald first.

214
00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:05.920
Well, I'm.. I'm sure
Special Agent Nussbaum

215
00:23:05.953 --> 00:23:07.889
has made it clear to you,
the more people we have

216
00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:09.590
working on this early on...

217
00:23:09.624 --> 00:23:11.158
the better our chances
of solving it.

218
00:23:11.192 --> 00:23:13.460
Uh, so, I'm gonna go get
Detective Mora,

219
00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:15.863
just so you don't have
to repeat yourself.

220
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:16.898
Excuse me.

221
00:23:22.536 --> 00:23:24.538
You wanna come outside
and take her statement?

222
00:23:25.773 --> 00:23:27.975
So...

223
00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:30.511
your boss trying to get some
or is he already getting it?

224
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:31.779
That's real nice, Mora.

225
00:23:31.812 --> 00:23:34.015
Sexualizing the wife
of a murder victim.

226
00:23:34.048 --> 00:23:35.149
No one asked for you guys.

227
00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:36.617
He just parachuted in on this.

228
00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:37.928
Yeah, couldn't agree
with you more.

229
00:23:37.952 --> 00:23:39.452
This is your investigation.

230
00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:40.731
But let's just do this, together

231
00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:42.657
and then I'll get Nussbaum
off your back.

232
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:44.959
I don't need to cut a deal.

233
00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:48.029
Can you just not be an asshole
all the time?

234
00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:50.064
Just say "yes", Danny.

235
00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:51.966
- Yes, Danny.
- Okay, let's go.

236
00:23:57.705 --> 00:24:00.641
Mrs. Van Camp,
this is Detective Danny Mora.

237
00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:04.477
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

238
00:24:04.512 --> 00:24:06.514
When's the last time
you saw your husband alive?

239
00:24:06.547 --> 00:24:09.482
Last night... around 9:00.

240
00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:11.652
I.. I was going
to an art opening.

241
00:24:12.586 --> 00:24:14.956
And Ellis was...

242
00:24:14.989 --> 00:24:17.792
He was going to file permits.

243
00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:21.494
Sounds like your husband
had something on the side.

244
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:26.233
I assumed that he was,
um, meeting a friend.

245
00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:28.869
- You have her number, or his..
- Linda.

246
00:24:28.903 --> 00:24:32.073
Let's have Agent Serra
continue the interview.

247
00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:34.041
I can get you her number.

248
00:24:34.075 --> 00:24:35.843
Thank you, ma'am.

249
00:24:35.876 --> 00:24:37.678
You have any business dealings

250
00:24:37.712 --> 00:24:40.715
that went bad, anyone you know
might wanna hurt him?

251
00:24:40.748 --> 00:24:42.750
Uh, I.. I.. I don't know.

252
00:24:45.286 --> 00:24:47.487
Please help me!

253
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.491
What am I gonna say to Em?

254
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.672
Don't expect too much.

255
00:25:04.705 --> 00:25:06.640
When the onset of Alzheimer's
is this sudden..

256
00:25:06.674 --> 00:25:08.709
I know how it starts.

257
00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:18.619
Hey, pal.

258
00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:22.023
It's me, Alex, your brother.

259
00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:23.724
You're looking good.

260
00:25:25.926 --> 00:25:27.628
Guess what?

261
00:25:27.661 --> 00:25:29.830
I found this the other day.

262
00:25:29.864 --> 00:25:33.601
1969.
Made me think of you.

263
00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:37.071
You remember that year?
Huh? The draft?

264
00:25:37.104 --> 00:25:38.773
The Suns and the Bucks.

265
00:25:38.806 --> 00:25:41.942
Both tied
for the First Round Pick.

266
00:25:41.976 --> 00:25:45.646
Down to a coin flip...
Phoenix calls heads.

267
00:25:48.682 --> 00:25:50.885
Yeah, it was tails.

268
00:25:50.918 --> 00:25:53.754
And the goddamn Bucks
get Lew Alcindor.

269
00:25:57.324 --> 00:26:00.961
Yeah, I don't watch
basketball much anymore.

270
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:06.767
Can't say I remember
the last time I did.

271
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:56.984
My Captain called this morning.

272
00:26:57.017 --> 00:26:58.819
Apparently,
I'm no longer needed.

273
00:26:58.853 --> 00:27:00.754
Good, I'm glad everybody's here.

274
00:27:00.788 --> 00:27:03.657
So... in light of what happened
with the Papa Leon raid

275
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:05.960
the Task Force
is being reorganized.

276
00:27:05.993 --> 00:27:08.229
Detective Marquez will be
heading back to Mexico.

277
00:27:08.262 --> 00:27:09.396
We're not done, sir.

278
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.007
Cooperation with
the Mexican Police has..

279
00:27:11.031 --> 00:27:13.267
We're done, Serra,
I've spent the last three days

280
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.170
getting an earful from
Washington, facts are facts.

281
00:27:16.203 --> 00:27:18.672
This has been a wide reaching
international investigation

282
00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:20.374
and we got nothing
to show for it.

283
00:27:22.476 --> 00:27:24.054
You have something
you wanna say, Marquez?

284
00:27:24.078 --> 00:27:25.880
It's not nothing, sir.

285
00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:27.281
We've gotten plenty in Mexico.

286
00:27:29.216 --> 00:27:33.020
But as soon as we come
into the US, things get, uh...

287
00:27:33.053 --> 00:27:35.156
I don't know, maybe your ears
in Washington

288
00:27:35.189 --> 00:27:37.158
just don't wanna hear.

289
00:27:38.993 --> 00:27:41.262
It's pretty obvious
the appetite for big fish,

290
00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:42.763
ends at the border.

291
00:27:42.796 --> 00:27:44.074
I don't like what
you're insinuating, Marquez.

292
00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:46.901
I don't think I was
insinuating anything.

293
00:27:46.934 --> 00:27:48.302
Was saying it pretty flat out.

294
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:50.037
Hugo has a point, sir.

295
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.182
We've never gotten anywhere
with the US-based <i>Padrote.</i>

296
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:53.774
If there even is such a thing.

297
00:27:53.807 --> 00:27:57.077
The word was Papa Leon served
rich men. White men.

298
00:27:57.111 --> 00:27:58.746
"The Word," is that
what you people

299
00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.181
build cases on in Juarez?

300
00:28:00.214 --> 00:28:01.415
We have Papa Leon on tape

301
00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:02.850
bragging about his clientele.

302
00:28:02.883 --> 00:28:05.186
Look, I know you take
this personally.

303
00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:07.021
But the well's gone dry.

304
00:28:10.357 --> 00:28:12.469
I know you don't want to believe
there's a white <i>Padrote,</i>

305
00:28:12.493 --> 00:28:14.104
but shutting down a case
don't make it so.

306
00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:16.063
- Watch yourself, Serra.
- We have a witness.

307
00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.765
What we have...

308
00:28:17.798 --> 00:28:19.109
is an undocumented minor
in detention.

309
00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:21.068
What we have
is a severely traumatized,

310
00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:23.170
undocumented minor in detention.

311
00:28:23.204 --> 00:28:25.072
And she's the only
valuable witness we have.

312
00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:26.449
When were you gonna
tell me you offered.

313
00:28:26.473 --> 00:28:28.709
Beatriz Leon a T-1 visa?

314
00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:30.411
I was coming to that.

315
00:28:30.444 --> 00:28:31.445
To notify me of the deal

316
00:28:31.478 --> 00:28:33.080
you're not authorized to make?

317
00:28:33.113 --> 00:28:34.882
With a witness in
a case you haven't made?

318
00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:36.518
I thought helping kids
like Beatriz Leon

319
00:28:36.551 --> 00:28:38.085
was part of our job.

320
00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:40.854
- She's eligible.
- The Task Force is done.

321
00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:43.057
And that is straight
from Washington.

322
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.826
As for Beatriz, we can T-1 her
and move her to a group home,

323
00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.229
but you need to focus
on the Van Camp murder.

324
00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:50.030
That's El Paso PD, every day.

325
00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:52.766
You want to help a kid
like Beatriz?

326
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.268
You play ball on the homicide.

327
00:28:58.372 --> 00:29:00.241
Yeah, okay.

328
00:29:03.277 --> 00:29:04.378
Thank you, sir.

329
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:06.247
Good.

330
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.881
Coleman, Howe.

331
00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:09.950
You'll have new
duty assignments this week.

332
00:29:09.984 --> 00:29:11.852
Detective Marquez,
on behalf of the Bureau

333
00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:14.321
and the United States,
I thank you for your service.

334
00:30:37.338 --> 00:30:40.074
I saw the paperwork,
is she a witness or victim?

335
00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:41.175
Both.

336
00:30:41.208 --> 00:30:42.943
I'll reach out
to Social Services,

337
00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:45.346
see what we can do
about counseling and school.

338
00:30:45.379 --> 00:30:46.880
That would be great.

339
00:30:46.914 --> 00:30:48.091
Is there any family
on either side

340
00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:49.983
of the border
I should know about?

341
00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:52.486
No, the father was a trafficker.

342
00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.088
- Hm.
- I'm gonna say goodbye.

343
00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:55.856
I'll keep you posted.

344
00:31:02.296 --> 00:31:04.198
I think you're
gonna be okay here.

345
00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:08.235
You asked me before, at Papa's,

346
00:31:08.268 --> 00:31:09.937
what I was drawing.

347
00:31:11.539 --> 00:31:13.941
It is a desert.

348
00:31:13.974 --> 00:31:15.976
I draw deserts.

349
00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:18.646
So you do, look at that.

350
00:31:20.414 --> 00:31:21.415
Keep it.

351
00:31:28.155 --> 00:31:30.924
I'll come back
to see you soon, okay?

352
00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:32.493
I promise you.

353
00:33:37.652 --> 00:33:40.420
For fuck's sake.

354
00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:50.798
She's a child.

355
00:33:50.832 --> 00:33:53.100
- And that's a problem?
- I won't do it.

356
00:33:53.133 --> 00:33:55.102
Your people knew
who the contract was for.

357
00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:57.572
I fucking won't do it.
Are you deaf?

358
00:33:57.605 --> 00:33:59.373
Well, maybe
I'll call Mexico City,

359
00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:00.684
see what they
have to say about that.

360
00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.276
No, no.

361
00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:06.280
No, you're gonna call
the contract off.

362
00:34:06.313 --> 00:34:08.282
The fuck I am.

363
00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:10.552
You're an employee!
I don't take fucking..

364
00:34:18.257 --> 00:34:20.828
You want this? Huh?

365
00:34:20.862 --> 00:34:22.630
You call the contract off.

366
00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:25.299
You really don't know
what you're playing with.

367
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:31.773
Oh, yes, I do.

368
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.844
Mr. Borden.

369
00:34:37.879 --> 00:34:42.416
Of 22 Bienveneda Avenue,
Silver Springs.

370
00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.219
The girl stays alive.

371
00:34:46.888 --> 00:34:49.322
Or you're answerable to me.

372
00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:50.489
Asshole.

373
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:07.609
No, no speeches or awards,
please.

374
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:09.544
My donation isn't about me.

375
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.182
Yes, you are correct.

376
00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:17.351
That is the amount
I'm prepared to give,

377
00:35:17.384 --> 00:35:19.621
however any construction funding

378
00:35:19.654 --> 00:35:22.389
by this donation cannot be named.

379
00:35:22.422 --> 00:35:24.224
"The Davana Sealman Wing."

380
00:35:24.257 --> 00:35:26.894
It must be simply,
"The Sealman Wing."

381
00:35:26.928 --> 00:35:28.896
I'm sure you understand.

382
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.465
Giving like this
is generational.

383
00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:39.206
Is he still on the line?

384
00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:41.241
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Myers?

385
00:35:41.274 --> 00:35:43.243
He cleared security
three minutes ago.

386
00:35:43.276 --> 00:35:45.647
Have him wait,
until I'm done with this.

387
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.247
Thank you.

388
00:35:54.689 --> 00:35:56.256
I thought I was clear.

389
00:35:56.289 --> 00:35:58.258
Never on the office number.

390
00:36:05.332 --> 00:36:06.768
He knows.

391
00:36:06.801 --> 00:36:08.335
That's a bit vague.

392
00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:09.937
He knows my name, where I live,

393
00:36:09.971 --> 00:36:12.339
and he won't do the job,
and he's got...

394
00:36:12.372 --> 00:36:14.542
He's got Van Camp's
flash drives.

395
00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:16.944
You said he wasn't
going to be a problem.

396
00:36:16.978 --> 00:36:19.212
I'm going to call Mexico City.

397
00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:21.214
That's one solution.

398
00:36:21.248 --> 00:36:23.518
An obvious and unsubtle one.

399
00:36:24.652 --> 00:36:26.253
What does he want?

400
00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:27.831
To have the contract on the girl
called off.

401
00:36:27.855 --> 00:36:29.489
We do that, he turns
over the info.

402
00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:31.358
There's something
to be said for that.

403
00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:32.994
You can't trust him.

404
00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:35.228
I didn't say I trusted him.

405
00:36:35.262 --> 00:36:36.931
I said, I see his point of view.

406
00:36:36.964 --> 00:36:39.701
Look, I know
what's on that drive.

407
00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:42.302
Randy's pretty obvious
about his quirks.

408
00:36:42.335 --> 00:36:43.638
This is not a conversation

409
00:36:43.671 --> 00:36:45.573
I'm comfortable
having with you, William.

410
00:36:45.606 --> 00:36:47.842
Oh, Jesus Christ, he knows!

411
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:49.443
About the girl, about me.

412
00:36:49.476 --> 00:36:50.812
I'll handle it.

413
00:36:50.845 --> 00:36:52.479
And don't call me again.

414
00:36:57.284 --> 00:36:58.485
Honestly, how it works,

415
00:36:58.519 --> 00:37:00.855
if you want my opinion,
is this the truth?

416
00:37:00.888 --> 00:37:02.724
Mm-hmm.

417
00:37:02.757 --> 00:37:04.859
Thank you kind, sir.

418
00:37:04.892 --> 00:37:07.394
Okay, as I was saying,
the truth...

419
00:37:07.427 --> 00:37:09.731
Well, well, wait. My bad.

420
00:37:09.764 --> 00:37:11.999
Cheers, again.

421
00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:14.434
So, maybe we
should just go upstairs,

422
00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:16.671
make some sort of a deal,
'cause at the end of the day,

423
00:37:16.704 --> 00:37:17.772
all I want is a blowie.

424
00:37:17.805 --> 00:37:19.741
Keep your voice down.

425
00:37:19.774 --> 00:37:21.642
Shh, we got a deal.

426
00:37:21.676 --> 00:37:22.744
I'll keep my voice down,

427
00:37:22.777 --> 00:37:24.478
but we still got to negotiate.

428
00:37:24.512 --> 00:37:27.280
Hey, leave the lady alone, pal.

429
00:37:27.314 --> 00:37:28.616
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, pops.

430
00:37:28.649 --> 00:37:30.484
First of all,
this ain't no lady.

431
00:37:30.518 --> 00:37:32.553
Which you're about to find out

432
00:37:32.587 --> 00:37:34.287
right about now,
am I right. Babe?

433
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:36.958
No, you're drunk.
Go to bed.

434
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:39.292
Okay, can you do us a favor,
please

435
00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:40.762
and get the fuck out of here..

436
00:37:43.598 --> 00:37:44.599
Fuck!

437
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.467
Are you fucking kidding me?

438
00:37:47.935 --> 00:37:49.504
Fuck you!

439
00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:04.417
Thank you.

440
00:38:05.385 --> 00:38:08.388
I'm sorry.
It's embarrassing.

441
00:38:08.421 --> 00:38:09.857
He's just a drunk at a bar,

442
00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:12.894
being an asshole in front
of a beautiful lady.

443
00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:14.695
Happens all the time.

444
00:38:47.595 --> 00:38:48.729
<i>Gracias.</i>

445
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.669
Tequila!

446
00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:09.984
Oh, come on, at least
I'm trying, Hugo.

447
00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:11.586
U-go.

448
00:39:12.687 --> 00:39:14.589
U-go.

449
00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:16.423
Ugo.

450
00:39:16.456 --> 00:39:18.993
They just don't wanna know,
do they?

451
00:39:19.026 --> 00:39:20.862
Take the little victories.

452
00:39:20.895 --> 00:39:22.763
Beatriz is out of detention.

453
00:39:33.908 --> 00:39:34.908
Why six?

454
00:39:36.644 --> 00:39:37.879
You don't want to know.

455
00:39:37.912 --> 00:39:39.881
Actually, I do.

456
00:39:41.649 --> 00:39:44.886
I was working on a case
in Juarez.

457
00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.520
The Dead Girls.

458
00:39:47.655 --> 00:39:50.558
Imagine, so many women disappear

459
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:52.994
and you can't do nothing.

460
00:39:53.027 --> 00:39:55.462
They say everyone
has their number.

461
00:39:55.495 --> 00:39:58.633
For the police they're all
just numbers.

462
00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:00.601
Six?

463
00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:02.937
Emiliana Manteras
was 13 years old.

464
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.640
Left her job at a
Maquilladora and disappeared.

465
00:40:05.673 --> 00:40:07.141
Just gone.

466
00:40:07.174 --> 00:40:08.576
Four months later,
a couple of kids

467
00:40:08.609 --> 00:40:10.044
found her body in a dump.

468
00:40:11.946 --> 00:40:13.748
Her mother, her sisters.

469
00:40:15.049 --> 00:40:16.817
They were strong.

470
00:40:16.851 --> 00:40:18.719
They plastered Emiliana's
photo on the walls

471
00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:20.821
of headquarters in all the city.

472
00:40:21.822 --> 00:40:23.224
The problem wasn't
that no one knew

473
00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:24.725
what happened to the girl.

474
00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:27.194
Everyone knew.

475
00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:28.996
Emiliana got into a car
with a soldier.

476
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.698
Arturo Pontilla.

477
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:33.200
Pontilla liked to party
with the Narcos.

478
00:40:33.234 --> 00:40:34.535
I followed him.

479
00:40:34.568 --> 00:40:36.671
I built the case quietly.

480
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:38.205
But since Pontilla was military,

481
00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:40.508
the indictment had to go
to his commander first

482
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:42.643
and they just fucking
transfer him to Sinaloa.

483
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.749
Three weeks later,
Emiliana's mother,

484
00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:50.818
aunt and three sisters
disappeared.

485
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.689
They hung those women
from a bridge

486
00:40:54.722 --> 00:40:57.758
right in front
of my office window.

487
00:40:57.792 --> 00:40:58.960
Jesus.

488
00:41:01.028 --> 00:41:02.863
You should learn the prayer.

489
00:41:28.222 --> 00:41:29.623
Hey!

490
00:41:31.892 --> 00:41:33.961
Shh! Hey!

491
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:36.897
You're okay.

492
00:41:37.898 --> 00:41:39.033
Who are you?

493
00:41:39.066 --> 00:41:41.102
I'm Maya.

494
00:41:41.135 --> 00:41:42.570
You're at the hotel.

495
00:41:42.603 --> 00:41:45.006
- Hotel?
- Yes.

496
00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:46.774
Just had a bad dream.

497
00:41:48.275 --> 00:41:49.610
You're okay.

498
00:42:35.756 --> 00:42:37.925
That was nice,
maybe next time you're in town..

499
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:40.194
I won't be back.

500
00:42:40.227 --> 00:42:41.862
Alright.

501
00:42:41.896 --> 00:42:44.865
- Good luck then!
- And to you.

502
00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:46.267
A 13-year-old girl

503
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.369
has been murdered
in Sunset Heights.

504
00:42:48.402 --> 00:42:49.870
The minor, Beatriz Leon,

505
00:42:49.904 --> 00:42:52.339
had recently been
relocated to a group home

506
00:42:52.373 --> 00:42:54.642
from an El Paso
detention center.

507
00:42:54.675 --> 00:42:56.744
According to an El Paso
police spokesman,

508
00:42:56.777 --> 00:42:58.079
the young girl's murder is...

509
00:42:58.112 --> 00:43:00.247
Was I here last night?

510
00:43:00.281 --> 00:43:02.883
Yes. What's wrong?

511
00:43:02.917 --> 00:43:04.752
We're getting very
few details...

512
00:43:04.785 --> 00:43:06.754
- You sure?
- Yes!

513
00:43:06.787 --> 00:43:08.089
- I was here?
- Yes!

514
00:43:08.122 --> 00:43:10.224
- All night?
- Yes! Stop it, you're hurting..

515
00:43:10.257 --> 00:43:12.326
- I was here all night?
- Yes.

516
00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:14.829
Listen to me.
Very carefully.

517
00:43:14.862 --> 00:43:16.230
You have to leave now.

518
00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:17.965
You were never here,
we never met.

519
00:43:17.998 --> 00:43:20.634
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

520
00:43:20.668 --> 00:43:22.369
I have to go. Right?

521
00:43:22.403 --> 00:43:24.371
You stay away
from this hotel for a while.

522
00:43:24.405 --> 00:43:25.706
- A long while!
- Okay.

523
00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:28.175
- Do you hear me?
- Yes!

524
00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:31.112
Do not answer that door
for anyone. Anyone!

525
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:40.988
Well executed,
it is worth noting

526
00:43:41.021 --> 00:43:42.823
that violence against children,

527
00:43:42.857 --> 00:43:44.358
is a calling card of the cartels

528
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:45.826
across the border.

529
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.696
Called on for comment,
the Mayor had none.

530
00:44:28.903 --> 00:44:30.380
Hey! You forgot them,
you forgot your pills..

531
00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:32.173
Get back! Get back!

532
00:46:10.505 --> 00:46:12.840
When did you go soft, Alex?

533
00:46:14.609 --> 00:46:16.810
They'll end you for this.

534
00:46:16.844 --> 00:46:19.046
Happy retirement, Maury!

535
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:24.218
Alex!

536
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:28.155
Alex!

537
00:46:38.932 --> 00:46:42.903
Goodness, you got the
heart of a 35-year-old.

538
00:46:42.936 --> 00:46:45.573
At this rate,
you'll live to be 130.

539
00:46:45.607 --> 00:46:49.343
I'll give you
five million to make it 135.

540
00:46:54.014 --> 00:46:56.016
If you said, "Yes,"
I'd fire you.

541
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.919
You know if I said yes,
I'd want you to.

542
00:46:58.952 --> 00:47:02.624
My grandfather is a Abruzzese.
He lived to be 104.

543
00:47:02.657 --> 00:47:05.859
Yeah? Lucky guy.

544
00:47:05.893 --> 00:47:08.162
You know, that all region,
along the Adriatic,

545
00:47:08.195 --> 00:47:12.433
and Okinawa, Japan,
they call those blue zones.

546
00:47:12.466 --> 00:47:13.601
Places that generally have

547
00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:15.603
a higher percentage
of centenarians.

548
00:47:15.637 --> 00:47:18.138
I'm aware, Joseph.
But why?

549
00:47:18.172 --> 00:47:21.241
Nutrition? Lack of
pollutants in the air?

550
00:47:21.275 --> 00:47:24.178
There is no reason
we have to age, to decay.

551
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.047
Some medical professionals
might actually argue that.

552
00:47:27.081 --> 00:47:30.150
Everything can be
reprogrammed, modded.

553
00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:32.252
Why shouldn't human health
be the same?

554
00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:34.054
DNA's an algorithm.

555
00:47:34.088 --> 00:47:36.168
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
how to spend your money.

556
00:47:37.057 --> 00:47:38.959
Especially when so much of it

557
00:47:38.992 --> 00:47:41.061
ends up in your pocket.

558
00:47:57.177 --> 00:47:58.979
I appreciate you
giving me a call.

559
00:47:59.012 --> 00:48:00.558
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this town.

560
00:48:00.582 --> 00:48:03.450
Swear to God, it's getting
more like Afghanistan every day.

561
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.488
- Who are they?
- Matched set.

562
00:48:07.522 --> 00:48:08.989
Jane and Joe Doe.

563
00:48:09.022 --> 00:48:10.668
He was in the driver's seat,
blown the fuck up.

564
00:48:10.692 --> 00:48:12.126
She was in the trunk.

565
00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:13.927
.32 caliber bullet
to the neck,

566
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:15.396
jacketed with
suppressor markings.

567
00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:18.600
Just like we pulled out
of Beatriz Leon.

568
00:48:18.633 --> 00:48:21.135
Car's registered to a
David Marshall.

569
00:48:21.168 --> 00:48:22.670
Rented at the airport.

570
00:48:22.704 --> 00:48:25.272
Some expat businessman
out of San Diego.

571
00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:27.107
Probably the corpse in the car.

572
00:48:27.141 --> 00:48:29.076
We're running teeth
on them both.

573
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:30.453
Okay, this guy is drunk
as a skunk.

574
00:48:30.477 --> 00:48:33.147
He, uh, pulled a .24
three times over the limit.

575
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.024
So I need you to sign off
on the report before you go.

576
00:48:35.048 --> 00:48:36.518
You got it.

577
00:48:38.152 --> 00:48:40.688
- What's that?
- Found them on the floor.

578
00:48:40.722 --> 00:48:42.956
It didn't match anything
on our database,

579
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.693
so the lab is running chem-test.

580
00:48:45.727 --> 00:48:47.203
If that's a prescription,
it might help..

581
00:48:47.227 --> 00:48:49.096
The lab's on it,
we might not be fancy,

582
00:48:49.129 --> 00:48:50.632
Vincent, but we ain't dumb.

583
00:48:52.199 --> 00:48:53.711
I'll run the Marshall name
through VICAP,

584
00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:55.102
see if anything comes up.

585
00:48:55.135 --> 00:48:56.413
I'll hit you up
with the ballistics

586
00:48:56.437 --> 00:48:58.939
as soon as they come back.
Same with the pill.

587
00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:03.143
Hey!

588
00:49:03.177 --> 00:49:06.947
Sorry about the girl, man.
It was fucked up.

589
00:49:19.694 --> 00:49:21.729
I couldn't go back.

590
00:49:21.763 --> 00:49:24.398
They don't love you
in Mexico anymore?

591
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.603
You're not asking for
my permission to stay, are you?

592
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:32.105
- Linda said I had to.
- Oh, well, in that case..

593
00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:35.209
Come on, you know
what she's like.

594
00:49:35.242 --> 00:49:36.443
Yeah.

595
00:49:36.477 --> 00:49:39.581
Nobody gives a fuck about
that girl, Vincent.

596
00:49:39.614 --> 00:49:42.216
Except you, me and Linda.

597
00:49:44.251 --> 00:49:47.522
I can do things
you and her can't. You know?

598
00:49:47.555 --> 00:49:49.691
As a concerned citizen.

599
00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:51.759
From Mexico?

600
00:49:51.793 --> 00:49:54.194
Okay, concerned Mexican citizen.

601
00:49:54.228 --> 00:49:55.730
With questionable investigative

602
00:49:55.763 --> 00:49:57.264
authority in the United States.

603
00:49:58.733 --> 00:50:00.768
Yeah, Nussbaum is
really gonna go for that.

604
00:50:00.802 --> 00:50:04.071
Fuck Nussbaum.
I don't work for him.

605
00:52:18.506 --> 00:52:20.340
Look, I promise
you I had no reason

606
00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:22.710
to say anything unless
you give me one.

607
00:52:22.744 --> 00:52:26.380
What you're doing right
now is incredibly stupid, Ellis.

608
00:52:26.413 --> 00:52:27.782
I hope you understand that.

609
00:52:27.815 --> 00:52:31.886
You've left me no choice.
I won't be cut out.

610
00:52:31.919 --> 00:52:33.487
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

611
00:52:33.521 --> 00:52:35.322
Blackmail is already ugly.

612
00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:37.792
- Look, all..
- Mr. Van Camp!

613
00:52:37.825 --> 00:52:39.459
We are not negotiating.

614
00:52:39.493 --> 00:52:42.697
You've crossed a line
from which there is no return.

615
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.019
Looks like another .32 caliber.

616
00:54:12.053 --> 00:54:14.055
And I'm guessing
it's also gonna be jacketed

617
00:54:14.088 --> 00:54:15.890
with suppressor markings.

618
00:54:15.923 --> 00:54:17.658
I'm gonna go talk to the wife.

619
00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:20.360
See you there.

620
00:54:20.393 --> 00:54:21.963
Do you think he's right?

621
00:54:21.996 --> 00:54:23.631
I'd put money on it.

622
00:54:23.664 --> 00:54:25.533
This is a problem, no question.

623
00:54:25.566 --> 00:54:28.503
Maybe a hitter
cleaning up some shit.

624
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.510
I'll catch you guys later.

625
00:54:35.543 --> 00:54:36.878
Good idea.

626
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.027
Last time I checked, Serra,

627
00:54:44.051 --> 00:54:45.720
you were working the
Van Camp murder.

628
00:54:45.753 --> 00:54:47.722
Last time I checked, sir,
I work for the FBI.

629
00:54:47.755 --> 00:54:49.456
Was that Hugo Marquez
I just saw?

630
00:54:49.489 --> 00:54:52.359
Listen... I think
there's a connection

631
00:54:52.392 --> 00:54:54.461
between Beatriz Leon,
the Jane Doe found

632
00:54:54.494 --> 00:54:56.840
in the trunk of the car downtown
and this guy, William Borden.

633
00:54:56.864 --> 00:54:59.399
If this does turn out
to be a jacket of .32,

634
00:54:59.432 --> 00:55:01.410
that's three people likely
killed with the same weapon.

635
00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:03.805
Look, I get it, the girl.
She's under your skin.

636
00:55:03.838 --> 00:55:04.948
Maybe you're a little obsessed..

637
00:55:04.972 --> 00:55:06.073
I'm just doing my job.

638
00:55:06.107 --> 00:55:08.709
Hugo thinks it's a pro,
settling scores.

639
00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:11.946
We think it could be a
hitter from across the fence.

640
00:55:11.979 --> 00:55:13.548
But you can't be sure.

641
00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:15.716
We can't, but if the
ballistics match, and there

642
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.694
really is a Mexican killer
tearing ass through town,

643
00:55:17.718 --> 00:55:19.386
we might want to get
ahead of that.

644
00:55:19.419 --> 00:55:21.522
And we're gonna need Marquez.

645
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.093
Alright, do what you have to do.

646
00:55:26.127 --> 00:55:27.962
But I want updates twice a day.

647
00:55:27.995 --> 00:55:29.530
Yeah.

648
00:55:32.465 --> 00:55:34.669
Lab just came back
on those pills.

649
00:55:34.702 --> 00:55:35.770
Diffadyl.

650
00:55:35.803 --> 00:55:39.574
Alzheimer's drug. Your
shooter is loosing his shit.

651
00:55:39.607 --> 00:55:42.543
- Okay. Is the wife inside?
- Yeah.

652
00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:43.987
Keep your hands away
from the cage on that one.

653
00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:47.081
I don't know if it's medicine
or just plain crazy.

654
00:55:47.114 --> 00:55:49.550
- Wanna sit in on this?
- Sure.

655
00:55:57.024 --> 00:56:01.896
Mrs. Borden, I'm Agent Serra.
This is Detective Marquez.

656
00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:03.865
I'm sorry for what's happened.

657
00:56:03.898 --> 00:56:06.067
Part of life, right?

658
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.902
It's what they say...

659
00:56:09.036 --> 00:56:11.839
Hasn't really sunk in.

660
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:15.643
Hmm, FBI. Fancy.

661
00:56:15.676 --> 00:56:18.478
- You an agent, too?
- Liaison from Mexico.

662
00:56:18.512 --> 00:56:20.480
What's Mexico have to do
with William?

663
00:56:20.514 --> 00:56:21.849
He hated the place.

664
00:56:21.883 --> 00:56:25.152
Well, that's what
we're... hoping to find out.

665
00:56:25.186 --> 00:56:27.121
Have you noticed
anything unusual

666
00:56:27.154 --> 00:56:28.856
happen in the past few weeks,

667
00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.459
where your husband's behavior
has changed at all?

668
00:56:32.492 --> 00:56:36.097
Will's behavior
hasn't changed in 20 years.

669
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.766
No. Nothing.

670
00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:41.168
- What kind of law did he do?
- Real Estate.

671
00:56:41.202 --> 00:56:43.571
Sorry to ask
this, Mrs. Borden.

672
00:56:43.604 --> 00:56:45.039
But do you know
if your husband had

673
00:56:45.072 --> 00:56:46.641
any ties to prostitution?

674
00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:49.810
I have no idea. Sit down.

675
00:56:51.879 --> 00:56:54.048
Bill paying for it?

676
00:56:54.081 --> 00:56:56.517
Doesn't seem like him.

677
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:58.786
Did your husband know
Ellis Van Camp?

678
00:56:58.819 --> 00:57:02.823
I know Wendy.
I see her at the same events.

679
00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:06.928
It's all one big
cocktail party up here.

680
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:09.864
You like cocktails, Detective?

681
00:57:09.897 --> 00:57:13.701
Margaritas? Pina Coladas?

682
00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:17.505
Thanks for your help,
Mrs. Borden.

683
00:57:17.538 --> 00:57:19.907
If you need anything,
just give us a call.

684
00:57:27.715 --> 00:57:28.992
I'm afraid
she can't be disturbed..

685
00:57:29.016 --> 00:57:30.785
Don't even fucking start.

686
00:57:31.852 --> 00:57:33.521
I've been calling you
all morning.

687
00:57:33.554 --> 00:57:36.223
Borden's dead.
Someone executed him.

688
00:57:36.257 --> 00:57:39.492
And if he got to Borden,
then he's close.

689
00:57:39.527 --> 00:57:40.962
Jesus, mum..

690
00:57:48.302 --> 00:57:50.571
Just take a breath.

691
00:57:52.273 --> 00:57:53.674
<i>Bravo.</i>

692
00:57:55.009 --> 00:57:58.579
You need to leave El Paso.
Immediately.

693
00:57:58.612 --> 00:57:59.981
Take the company plane.

694
00:58:00.014 --> 00:58:01.792
What about tomorrow night,
it's all been arranged..

695
00:58:01.816 --> 00:58:03.818
Listen to me.

696
00:58:03.851 --> 00:58:07.688
Tomorrow, after the party,
you'll fly to Geneva.

697
00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:10.224
Stay at the house
and make arrangements

698
00:58:10.257 --> 00:58:11.926
for you to check
into rehab there.

699
00:58:11.959 --> 00:58:13.127
Rehab?

700
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.795
If things connect to you,

701
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:17.264
and we have a problem,
you will be working

702
00:58:17.298 --> 00:58:19.867
on your issues,
which will buy us time

703
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.604
to quietly hire
very good lawyers.

704
00:58:23.637 --> 00:58:27.108
Besides... you need help, Randy.

705
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:31.112
I'm sorry.

706
00:58:32.146 --> 00:58:34.015
I'm so sorry.

707
00:58:34.048 --> 00:58:36.584
I know you are, baby.

708
00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:38.753
I know you are.

709
00:58:41.822 --> 00:58:43.924
Full ballistics came back.

710
00:58:43.958 --> 00:58:46.794
Same gun killed Beatriz
and the Jane Doe in the car,

711
00:58:46.827 --> 00:58:50.765
but not Borden.
Two .32s, two shooters.

712
00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:52.233
Trafficking, Vincent Serra.

713
00:58:52.266 --> 00:58:55.169
You're the one who took
the girl to the group home.

714
00:58:55.202 --> 00:58:57.638
- Weren't you?
- Who is this?

715
00:58:57.671 --> 00:59:00.107
Marshall.
David Marshall.

716
00:59:00.141 --> 00:59:01.976
Tap and trace.

717
00:59:02.009 --> 00:59:05.046
Ah, David Marshall
burned up a car downtown.

718
00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:06.247
Is that your doing?

719
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.016
I can't keep doing
your job for you.

720
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:10.117
What job is that?

721
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:13.320
Borden, Van Camp.
What they did to children.

722
00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:15.056
You're not doing
anything about it.

723
00:59:15.089 --> 00:59:17.191
Are you saying
you killed William Borden?

724
00:59:17.224 --> 00:59:20.861
- And Ellis Van Camp?
- Yes.

725
00:59:20.895 --> 00:59:24.198
And what about the girl?
Beatriz Leon.

726
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:26.600
Not the girl.
That was Mauricio.

727
00:59:26.634 --> 00:59:28.803
The man in the car.

728
00:59:28.836 --> 00:59:32.673
You're too slow to make
them pay. They're too rich.

729
00:59:32.706 --> 00:59:37.011
- Who's too rich?
- The lawyer, the client.

730
00:59:37.044 --> 00:59:38.612
Who's the client?

731
00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:43.617
- Did you know her?
- Who?

732
00:59:43.651 --> 00:59:47.955
The.. The.. The girl.
B.. Beatriz.

733
00:59:47.988 --> 00:59:51.092
- A little.
- Did you care?

734
00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:52.960
Fifteen seconds.

735
00:59:52.993 --> 00:59:54.628
I certainly did.

736
00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:57.665
I want to believe that you
are a good man, Vincent.

737
00:59:57.698 --> 01:00:00.768
I'm the bad man.
Have been for a long time.

738
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.369
But they have to be punished.

739
01:00:02.403 --> 01:00:04.638
If I can't finish this...

740
01:00:04.672 --> 01:00:06.640
you have to.

741
01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:12.046
He's downstairs in the park.

742
01:00:22.156 --> 01:00:23.991
Hey, move!

743
01:00:24.024 --> 01:00:25.392
What is this?

744
01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:32.700
He's fucking with us.

745
01:00:32.733 --> 01:00:34.768
He's just telling us
we're way too slow.

746
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:37.280
We've got an asshole
exploiting a kid

747
01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:39.907
and how long is it taking us
to bring him to trial?

748
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.909
Two to three years, right?

749
01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:52.853
He said they're too rich.

750
01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:54.731
Now, we've been getting
push back on the trafficking

751
01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:56.423
every step of the way.

752
01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:58.692
No, I think
he's, he's taking out

753
01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:01.729
the traffickers
that we couldn't.

754
01:01:01.762 --> 01:01:03.330
Leaving us breadcrumbs.

755
01:01:03.364 --> 01:01:05.766
Proving a point.

756
01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:25.186
Well... Detective Marquez.

757
01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:26.921
How long were you watching me?

758
01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:28.889
I just got here,
Mrs. Borden.

759
01:01:28.923 --> 01:01:30.925
You shouldn't leave
the gate open.

760
01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:33.427
Whatever will be will be.

761
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.863
And if you're
watching over me...

762
01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:38.199
nothing to worry about, right?

763
01:01:38.232 --> 01:01:40.201
You're a strong swimmer.

764
01:01:40.234 --> 01:01:42.169
I'm out of shape.

765
01:01:54.048 --> 01:01:57.351
I was an alternate
for the '92 Olympic team.

766
01:01:57.384 --> 01:02:00.921
I was 17.
Best time of my life.

767
01:02:00.955 --> 01:02:03.424
By '96, I'd lost a second.

768
01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:05.926
That was it.

769
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.428
Done.

770
01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:08.929
So instead of a Wheaties Box

771
01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:11.198
and a dashing husband in LA,

772
01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:13.200
I ended up here.

773
01:02:13.234 --> 01:02:15.503
In Texas.

774
01:02:15.537 --> 01:02:17.104
Could you pass me that glass?

775
01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.974
Sure.

776
01:02:25.513 --> 01:02:27.214
So, what do you want, Detective?

777
01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.519
Well...

778
01:02:31.553 --> 01:02:34.021
I'm not here to clean your pool.

779
01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:36.890
You are not a real
cop here, are you?

780
01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:39.527
That's why I'm here.

781
01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:42.196
What? To not arrest me?

782
01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:43.998
Have you ever heard your
husband talk about

783
01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.533
a man named David Marshall?

784
01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:49.870
You didn't come here
to ask me questions.

785
01:02:49.903 --> 01:02:52.172
I didn't come here
for that either.

786
01:02:53.974 --> 01:02:56.410
I stayed out of
William's business.

787
01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:58.145
Wives know.

788
01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:01.282
I never knew the name,

789
01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:02.850
but I heard him on the phone.

790
01:03:02.883 --> 01:03:06.020
He was nervous.
He didn't want me to hear.

791
01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.557
He was talking about a man
from Mexico City.

792
01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:11.191
Why didn't you say
something before?

793
01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:14.161
Because of who
he was talking to.

794
01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:15.896
Davana Sealman.

795
01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.432
That's why I didn't
say anything.

796
01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:20.067
He was being used.

797
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.368
How?

798
01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:23.203
You should go.

799
01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:27.207
Thank you, <i>Senora</i> Borden.

800
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:30.044
Don't ever come back,
Detective Marquez.

801
01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:35.883
Davana Sealman? You sure?

802
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.585
That's the name she said.

803
01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:39.920
Borden was probably one
of her attorneys.

804
01:03:39.953 --> 01:03:41.889
Nope, Borden's name isn't listed

805
01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:43.324
on any of the filings
for Sea Corp

806
01:03:43.357 --> 01:03:45.159
or Davana Sealman personally.

807
01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:47.595
You realize we're talking
about one of the most powerful

808
01:03:47.629 --> 01:03:49.330
real estate moguls
in the country, right?

809
01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.598
Yeah. Yeah.

810
01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:52.475
I know, but Borden spoke
to Sealman on the phone

811
01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.068
about the
"Man from Mexico City."

812
01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:57.871
Oh, you got proof?
Well, did you bang her at least?

813
01:03:57.905 --> 01:03:59.449
I mean, if you're gonna take
the word of a half-drunk

814
01:03:59.473 --> 01:04:02.610
trophy wife, you may as well get
something out of it, right?

815
01:04:02.644 --> 01:04:05.079
- Did she elaborate?
- What?

816
01:04:05.112 --> 01:04:06.480
On the "Man from Mexico City."

817
01:04:06.514 --> 01:04:08.082
Shut up, hold on!

818
01:04:08.115 --> 01:04:10.851
Borden wasn't one of
Davana Sealman's lawyers.

819
01:04:11.985 --> 01:04:13.954
He was one of Randy
Sealman's lawyers.

820
01:04:13.987 --> 01:04:16.090
Davana's son.

821
01:04:16.123 --> 01:04:19.393
Apparently, Randy's also
a real estate mogul.

822
01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:21.295
Oh, fuck.

823
01:04:21.328 --> 01:04:25.600
Randy Sealman's company owns the
Central Processing facility.

824
01:04:25.633 --> 01:04:27.067
Where they sent Beatriz.

825
01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:29.069
Hey, in case
you haven't noticed,

826
01:04:29.103 --> 01:04:30.505
they send a lot of people there.

827
01:04:30.538 --> 01:04:32.640
Oh, yeah, I know.

828
01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:34.942
But she's 13.

829
01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:37.244
Imagine how vulnerable
you feel at that age

830
01:04:37.277 --> 01:04:38.946
in an ICE center.

831
01:04:40.147 --> 01:04:42.149
Okay, let's take a look.

832
01:04:44.118 --> 01:04:45.953
Okay. Well, it's not her
first time there.

833
01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:47.297
She was there last year
for three weeks

834
01:04:47.321 --> 01:04:49.089
with her father,
and then they were deported.

835
01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:53.427
It gets stickier. Ellis
Van Camp was CPF's builder.

836
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.130
So everyone associated
with this Processing Centre,

837
01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:57.665
the lawyer, the builder,

838
01:04:57.699 --> 01:05:00.367
Beatriz, all dead.

839
01:05:01.703 --> 01:05:04.004
He's going to kill
Randy Sealman.

This is so far away

850

So this guy,

851
01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:22.049
he owns the detention center.

852
01:06:22.082 --> 01:06:24.051
And you're wondering why
we're protecting him?

853
01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:26.220

Randy is on the lower deck,
moving inside.

858
01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:44.506
- On my way.
- Hugo, keep eyes on deck.

859
01:06:44.539 --> 01:06:47.407
Got it.

860
01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:51.579
Target's on the boat!

861
01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:08.362
Take that shit off.

Okay?
Good girl.

864
01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:32.119
You scum.

865
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.508
Put it down.

866
01:08:32.714 --> 01:08:34.348
Attaboy.

867
01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:39.754
You're Vincent, aren't you?

868
01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:41.220
I am.

869
01:08:41.254 --> 01:08:43.457
I'm Alex. Alex Lewis.

870
01:08:44.826 --> 01:08:47.694
You know what those people did
to that child, right?

871
01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:49.631
Only too well.

872
01:08:49.663 --> 01:08:51.933
I've done crazy things.

873
01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:54.201
But you don't hurt
children, ever.

874
01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:56.203
Listen, why don't you
and I just...

875
01:08:56.236 --> 01:08:58.337
- Just have a talk?
- No time for that.

876
01:08:58.372 --> 01:08:59.783
I understand
why you're saying that.

877
01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.643
I know you're not well.

878
01:09:01.676 --> 01:09:03.243
We all have to die, Vincent.

879
01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:04.854
What's important is what you
do before you go..

880
01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:07.256
- Vincent! Put your gun down!
- Get outta here get outta here!

881
01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.916
- Is your friend a good shot?
- Very.

882
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:10.661
- Then it's in your hands.
- Don't move!

883
01:09:10.685 --> 01:09:12.920
Put the fucking gun down!

884
01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:16.524
If I'm dead,
she'll never know the truth.

885
01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:18.526
Put the gun down.

886
01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:40.548
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck are you doing?

887
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:41.916
I've got it!

888
01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:03.798
You know, I quit drinking
15 years ago.

889
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:05.800
But right now, I can
actually taste the scotch

890
01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:07.902
in the back of my throat.

891
01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:09.402
Davana Sealman's only son

892
01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.873
was just murdered on my watch.

893
01:11:11.906 --> 01:11:14.374
She's not happy with us.

894
01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:16.711
The lady has even hired
off-duty cops for protection.

895
01:11:16.744 --> 01:11:18.378
He was way ahead of us.

896
01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:20.057
He was probably on that boat
before the party even began.

897
01:11:20.081 --> 01:11:21.983
Who is this fucking guy, Vince?

898
01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:23.985
Alex Lewis.

899
01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.353
Well, I can tell you
he's American.

900
01:11:26.386 --> 01:11:28.388
He's no doubt a contractor,
but...

901
01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:31.025
I don't think
these have all been hits.

902
01:11:31.058 --> 01:11:33.360
He wants revenge
for Beatriz Leon.

903
01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.572
Sir, you alright?

904
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.478
Have you been
drinking tonight, sir?

905
01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:28.082
Paul...

906
01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:30.885
Paul with his sons.

907
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.364
Jesus.

908
01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:04.739
Motorcycle patrolman Eric Lyle.

909
01:15:04.772 --> 01:15:06.741
Must have found Alex wounded.

910
01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:08.776
There was blood
all over the Bronco.

911
01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:11.579
I don't know.
Maybe he got spooked.

912
01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:13.014
That's not his style.

913
01:15:13.047 --> 01:15:14.281
His style is murder, Vincent.

914
01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:16.584
No, we need to find him
before the El Paso PD.

915
01:15:16.617 --> 01:15:17.828
They're not going
to be happy about this.

916
01:15:17.852 --> 01:15:21.155
Well, we know something
they don't.

917
01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:24.158
I think I know
who Alex Lewis is.

918
01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.659
I ran juvenile records.

919
01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:28.062
Vandalism, auto-theft, assault.

920
01:15:28.095 --> 01:15:29.697
Well, it could be him.

921
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.900
Only problem is,
Alex Lewis is dead.

922
01:15:32.933 --> 01:15:35.136
He and his father died in the
fire at the family bakery

923
01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:36.637
forty years ago.

924
01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.673
Investigators thought
Alex set the fire.

925
01:15:39.707 --> 01:15:41.175
Brother's still in town though.

926
01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:43.577
Care facility on the parkway.

927
01:15:43.611 --> 01:15:45.646
Advanced Alzheimer's.

928
01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.715
Man's a vegetable.

929
01:15:47.748 --> 01:15:49.784
I also came up
with medical records.

930
01:15:49.817 --> 01:15:51.986
Alex and his brother
were well known at the ER.

931
01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:55.623
Always a "fall down the stairs"
or an "accidental burn."

932
01:15:55.656 --> 01:15:58.059
Other things
were harder to hide.

933
01:15:58.092 --> 01:16:00.161
Father was never charged
with the abuse.

934
01:16:00.194 --> 01:16:02.296
Sexual or physical.

935
01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:04.065
Want me to warrant the bakery?

936
01:16:04.098 --> 01:16:05.166
Definitely.

937
01:17:35.823 --> 01:17:37.324
This guy from Mexico City,

938
01:17:37.358 --> 01:17:40.161
the one Borden was talking to
Davana Sealman about.

939
01:17:40.194 --> 01:17:42.963
What if she hired him?

940
01:17:42.997 --> 01:17:44.437
'Cause I'm thinking
if Alex is not up

941
01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:46.867
to killing Sealman himself,

942
01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:48.435
he wants us to bring her in.

943
01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:50.271
Catch is, the only person
who can connect.

944
01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:51.372
Sealman to any of this..

945
01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:52.907
Is Alex.

946
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.442
She's harder to get
to than any of the others.

947
01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:58.445
He reached out to you
to cover his bets.

948
01:17:58.479 --> 01:18:00.181
The only address
from Paul and Alex's

949
01:18:00.214 --> 01:18:01.448
medical records is the bakery.

950
01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.851
Oh, forget about it,
that place is a wreck.

951
01:18:03.884 --> 01:18:05.886
Unless you're looking
for a pigeon.

952
01:18:07.087 --> 01:18:08.489
What did you say?

953
01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.724
Pigeons.

954
01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:13.060
<i>Palomas.</i>
The place is full of them.

955
01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:14.929
The lab report on the Bronco...

956
01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:17.064
the one where the
patrolman got killed,

957
01:18:17.097 --> 01:18:19.233
the floor had traces
of pigeon shit on it.

958
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.042
Anything I can get you?

959
01:19:38.312 --> 01:19:39.547
What?

960
01:19:39.581 --> 01:19:41.583
Anything you need?

961
01:19:41.616 --> 01:19:43.350
No, thank you.

962
01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:04.371
Top of the hour, boys.
Check in.

963
01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:51.985
Boss!

964
01:20:56.457 --> 01:20:58.459
Let him up.

965
01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:00.427
Get him a new battery.

966
01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:14.942
- Put them down!
- Now!

967
01:21:22.684 --> 01:21:24.351
You! Get back!

968
01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:41.135
Stay in here. Don't open
that door to anybody.

969
01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:45.540
Boys! Main office.
Live shooter! Live shooter!

970
01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.722
He's headed for the roof.

971
01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:56.076
Mora.

972
01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:57.411
Mora, he's on the roof.

973
01:22:57.444 --> 01:23:00.080
Copy. If you get the chance,
put him down.

974
01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:02.983
Copy that.

975
01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.623
It's all over.

976
01:23:08.656 --> 01:23:11.225
Let's get you out of here.

977
01:23:39.119 --> 01:23:42.289
You killed my son.

978
01:23:42.322 --> 01:23:43.390
Yes.

979
01:23:45.693 --> 01:23:47.629
And I know what you've done.

980
01:24:18.358 --> 01:24:20.060
Firing pin.

981
01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.571
You know why I didn't just
off you back there?

982
01:24:33.808 --> 01:24:36.476
Let me tell you why.

983
01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:44.519
That would have been mercy.

984
01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:46.688
No. I want to see you
go to Yuma.

985
01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:49.657
Where I will make sure they
fuck you to death, old man.

986
01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:52.192
You cop-killing piece of shit.

987
01:24:57.364 --> 01:24:59.366
How about that little girl?

988
01:24:59.399 --> 01:25:02.269
You know what they do to
people who hurt kids?

989
01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:07.441
I'll talk to FBI Agent
V.. V.. Vincent Serra.

990
01:25:08.643 --> 01:25:09.844
No one else.

991
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.782
Fuck the feds.

992
01:25:14.816 --> 01:25:16.450
We got you on
three counts of murder.

993
01:25:16.483 --> 01:25:18.753
Your busted fucking gun
matches Borden

994
01:25:18.786 --> 01:25:20.253
and Officer Eric Lyle.

995
01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:21.756
Guy had a wife and two kids..

996
01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:25.392
Danny!
He needs a doctor.

997
01:25:29.564 --> 01:25:31.231
No, he doesn't.

998
01:25:31.264 --> 01:25:33.501
I've got all day, and
by the end, I swear to God,

999
01:25:33.534 --> 01:25:36.336
I'll have me a
written confession.

1000
01:25:38.673 --> 01:25:40.842
If he went after Sealman
with a broken gun,

1001
01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:42.577
we'd have heard something.

1002
01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:44.454
I just think he's at the end.
He ain't remembering things.

1003
01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:46.848
And also, PPD has gone
totally silent.

1004
01:25:46.881 --> 01:25:49.517
And this came from the
bakery address.

1005
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.952
What is it?

1006
01:26:11.304 --> 01:26:14.408
Jesus.
Where did you get this?

1007
01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:15.910
It doesn't matter.

1008
01:26:15.943 --> 01:26:17.745
El Paso PD are holding
Alex Lewis

1009
01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:19.914
and I need you to transfer him
into our custody.

1010
01:26:19.947 --> 01:26:21.783
Let him be their problem.

1011
01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:26.587
Which side of this do you
really want to be on?

1012
01:26:28.255 --> 01:26:30.490
I need to talk to him.

1013
01:26:30.525 --> 01:26:32.292
But it seems
very powerful people

1014
01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:34.662
don't want that to happen.

1015
01:27:06.393 --> 01:27:08.462
What the fuck did you do to him?

1016
01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:10.998
- He resisted arrest.
- So you had to bust him up?

1017
01:27:11.032 --> 01:27:12.567
He's a cop killer
for fuck's sake.

1018
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.769
You like being on
Davana Sealman's payroll?

1019
01:27:14.802 --> 01:27:16.571
Hey!

1020
01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:18.305
Cool off!

1021
01:27:29.851 --> 01:27:31.519
Well, well.

1022
01:27:33.654 --> 01:27:35.455
The FBI.

1023
01:27:36.657 --> 01:27:37.658
Huh.

1024
01:27:38.826 --> 01:27:40.628
You are the one that shot me.

1025
01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:43.363
I'm not going to offer
an apology.

1026
01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:45.533
I'm not asking for one.

1027
01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:52.840
Thank you.

1028
01:28:04.384 --> 01:28:06.754
These aren't going to help
for much longer.

1029
01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.993
I understand you want
to clear this up.

1030
01:28:12.026 --> 01:28:13.561
Clear this up?

1031
01:28:13.594 --> 01:28:14.896
No.

1032
01:28:14.929 --> 01:28:16.631
I want Sealman dead.

1033
01:28:16.664 --> 01:28:18.833
Well, she's not officially
tied to any crime.

1034
01:28:18.866 --> 01:28:20.802
You know that's not true.

1035
01:28:20.835 --> 01:28:22.670
She sanctioned the hit.

1036
01:28:22.703 --> 01:28:25.673
She hired me to kill...
two people.

1037
01:28:25.706 --> 01:28:29.577
Ellis Van Camp and
the second was that child.

1038
01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.680
Girl of thirteen.
Be.. Be.. Beatriz.

1039
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.917
I won't do that.

1040
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:37.450
No.

1041
01:28:38.418 --> 01:28:40.555
No. You don't touch children.

1042
01:28:42.455 --> 01:28:45.392
- Okay, press down.
- Thank you.

1043
01:28:45.425 --> 01:28:47.962
I really appreciate you
being here for me.

1044
01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:49.931
During all this.

1045
01:28:49.964 --> 01:28:52.133
You're not just a client,
you know.

1046
01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:54.535
Is that true, Joseph?

1047
01:28:54.569 --> 01:28:57.138
You know, the hardest thing
is never really trusting

1048
01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.140
those people close to you.

1049
01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:00.708
Besides Randy...

1050
01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:03.978
I will never really
know why someone is with me.

1051
01:29:04.011 --> 01:29:07.048
Come on.
I'm your friend, Davana.

1052
01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:08.883
I'm here for you.

1053
01:29:15.156 --> 01:29:18.826
The retainer for your services
is $10 million.

1054
01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:23.564
I can't.

1055
01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:26.399
Do you realize what
you're asking me to do?

1056
01:29:26.433 --> 01:29:28.135
I'm sorry. No.

1057
01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:30.738
- I took an oath.
- An oath?

1058
01:29:30.771 --> 01:29:32.506
Like a marriage vow?

1059
01:29:33.908 --> 01:29:36.476
You were at Randy's parties.

1060
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:38.411
You think I didn't know?

1061
01:29:38.445 --> 01:29:40.615
So, let's make this simple.

1062
01:29:40.648 --> 01:29:43.416
$10 million or prosecution

1063
01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:45.186
and prison for sex with minors.

1064
01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.554
Davana..

1065
01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:48.155
You need to understand
something.

1066
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:49.824
Randy was weak.

1067
01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:51.893
But he was my son.

1068
01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:53.928
You are not.

1069
01:29:55.796 --> 01:30:00.768
Murder for hire.
Murder for revenge. Child abuse.

1070
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:02.803
It's all here.

1071
01:30:02.837 --> 01:30:04.205
It's not over.

1072
01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:05.907
Everybody's dead, Alex.

1073
01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:11.679
Even if you do make it to trial,
you get life, my friend,

1074
01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:13.648
which from what
the doctors tell me

1075
01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:15.549
is maybe three to six months.

1076
01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:17.919
So, what are we doing here?

1077
01:30:17.952 --> 01:30:21.822
- Why are we here?
- Davana Sealman.

1078
01:30:21.856 --> 01:30:23.190
Justice.

1079
01:30:23.224 --> 01:30:25.526
Justice?

1080
01:30:25.559 --> 01:30:29.030
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll testify to all that..

1081
01:30:29.063 --> 01:30:30.731
You're a contract killer.

1082
01:30:30.765 --> 01:30:33.067
You think your testimony's
going to stand up in court?

1083
01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.737
- She hired me to kill a child.
- Did you get that in writing?

1084
01:30:36.771 --> 01:30:38.239
We're gonna need that evidence.

1085
01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:44.946
You really expect
we're gonna find justice?

1086
01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:46.847
I expect you to try.

1087
01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:50.551
Listen...

1088
01:30:50.584 --> 01:30:52.086
Let me tell you something...

1089
01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:53.921
about justice.

1090
01:30:53.955 --> 01:30:55.623
Twelve months ago,

1091
01:30:55.656 --> 01:30:58.491
a drunk driver
was flying down the I-8

1092
01:30:58.526 --> 01:30:59.560
in a stolen car.

1093
01:30:59.593 --> 01:31:00.561
He's high on meth.

1094
01:31:00.594 --> 01:31:02.830
He hasn't seen another car

1095
01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:04.207
that's pulled over
on the shoulder.

1096
01:31:04.231 --> 01:31:05.866
A mom and her ten-year-old son.

1097
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.669
Coming home from Legoland.
They got a flat tire.

1098
01:31:08.703 --> 01:31:10.213
But Colvey, he doesn't
see that the woman

1099
01:31:10.237 --> 01:31:11.973
is out there changing the tire.

1100
01:31:12.006 --> 01:31:14.875
He just plows right into her.
Kills her.

1101
01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:16.644
Now, he stops his car

1102
01:31:16.677 --> 01:31:18.980
and he sees behind him
the boy's jumped out.

1103
01:31:19.013 --> 01:31:20.581
He's obviously screaming.

1104
01:31:20.614 --> 01:31:24.085
Seeing his mom, dead
on the road, crying for help.

1105
01:31:24.118 --> 01:31:25.953
But Colvey doesn't help.

1106
01:31:25.987 --> 01:31:29.256
He puts his car in reverse
and backs over the boy.

1107
01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:31.993
Making sure
there's no witnesses.

1108
01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:34.795
Then he torches his car
two miles down the road.

1109
01:31:34.829 --> 01:31:37.098
But a 15-year-old girl,
she sees him.

1110
01:31:37.131 --> 01:31:40.801
She sees a man walking away
from a big fire with a gas can.

1111
01:31:40.835 --> 01:31:42.203
Now, it ain't much,
but it's enough

1112
01:31:42.236 --> 01:31:44.205
to put Colvey on trial.

1113
01:31:44.238 --> 01:31:46.107
You know what happened?

1114
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.675
They do a photo line-up.

1115
01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:50.144
But the girl,
she doesn't pick Colvey.

1116
01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:51.545
So they do an in-person,

1117
01:31:51.579 --> 01:31:53.280
and again
she doesn't pick Colvey,

1118
01:31:53.314 --> 01:31:56.017
even though everybody
knows it's him.

1119
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:57.618
Three times, three line-ups.

1120
01:31:57.651 --> 01:31:59.887
Each time she picks
a different guy.

1121
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.756
And Colvey walks.

1122
01:32:01.789 --> 01:32:03.691
And he's still out there.

1123
01:32:05.326 --> 01:32:06.894
So...

1124
01:32:08.162 --> 01:32:10.631
memory's a motherfucker.

1125
01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:12.133
And as for justice...

1126
01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.072
It ain't guaranteed.

1127
01:32:20.808 --> 01:32:22.676
Your wife.

1128
01:32:26.814 --> 01:32:28.082
Your son.

1129
01:32:37.992 --> 01:32:40.561
I have evidence.

1130
01:32:42.963 --> 01:32:45.633
Yeah?
What evidence do you got?

1131
01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:49.670
A phone call.
Davana Sealman.

1132
01:32:49.703 --> 01:32:51.872
Threatening...

1133
01:32:51.906 --> 01:32:55.076
Threatening the first man
I killed.

1134
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:56.677
Ellis Van Camp?

1135
01:32:56.710 --> 01:33:01.715
Yes. I have that call
on a... flip...

1136
01:33:01.749 --> 01:33:02.950
- Flash?
- Flash.

1137
01:33:02.983 --> 01:33:05.052
- Flash drive?
- Flash drive.

1138
01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:06.787
Where is it?

1139
01:33:09.023 --> 01:33:11.258
I don't know.

1140
01:33:11.292 --> 01:33:13.060
Help, help me...

1141
01:33:14.228 --> 01:33:15.996
Help me remember.

1142
01:33:17.331 --> 01:33:19.133
Please.

1143
01:33:19.166 --> 01:33:20.734
We will.

1144
01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.604
We will.

1145
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.142
That makes me sick
to my stomach.

1146
01:33:29.877 --> 01:33:32.246
I'm glad that bastard is dead.

1147
01:33:32.279 --> 01:33:35.182
His mother was covering for him.

1148
01:33:35.216 --> 01:33:37.251
- Davana Sealman?
- Yeah.

1149
01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:39.887
That woman hasn't had
a parking ticket in her life.

1150
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.090
She knew that her son
was raping minors.

1151
01:33:43.124 --> 01:33:45.426
She also paid for the hit
on Ellis Van Camp.

1152
01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:47.161
Based on what evidence?

1153
01:33:47.194 --> 01:33:50.030
The man she hired, Alex Lewis.
He made it very clear to me..

1154
01:33:50.064 --> 01:33:52.299
Oh, the testimony
of a professional killer?

1155
01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:54.368
Alex Lewis was hired
by William Borden

1156
01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:55.703
for Davana Sealman.

1157
01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:56.704
Isn't this the same man

1158
01:33:56.737 --> 01:33:57.814
who has some kind of dementia?

1159
01:33:57.838 --> 01:33:59.006
Advanced Alzheimer's.

1160
01:33:59.039 --> 01:33:59.673
Yeah, yeah.

1161
01:33:59.707 --> 01:34:01.308
Look, I need real evidence.

1162
01:34:01.342 --> 01:34:03.010
Alright, not just
the fucking testimony

1163
01:34:03.043 --> 01:34:06.180
of some murderer who's
cognitively impaired. Jesus.

1164
01:34:06.213 --> 01:34:08.415
Any decent lawyer would
annihilate him on the stand.

1165
01:34:08.449 --> 01:34:10.384
Listen, apparently,
there's a recording

1166
01:34:10.417 --> 01:34:12.153
of Davana Sealman
on a phone call

1167
01:34:12.186 --> 01:34:14.822
explicitly threatening Van Camp.

1168
01:34:14.855 --> 01:34:18.058
- Well, that I can use.
- I'm working on it.

1169
01:34:18.092 --> 01:34:20.161
Well, you bring me the audio,
and if it's solid,

1170
01:34:20.194 --> 01:34:22.029
I'll make the case.

1171
01:34:22.062 --> 01:34:23.797
Thank you, sir.

1172
01:34:29.837 --> 01:34:31.138
Are you sure you're up for this?

1173
01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:34.808
No, Gerald. I'm definitely
fucking not up for this.

1174
01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:49.156
Alex.

1175
01:34:50.424 --> 01:34:53.227
Listen. We need to find
that recording.

1176
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.797
Without that,
they.. They can't bring charges.

1177
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.732
Do you remember where it is?

1178
01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:02.236
I.. I've been trying
to remember.

1179
01:35:02.269 --> 01:35:04.104
Okay.

1180
01:35:04.138 --> 01:35:06.307
I can't.

1181
01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.776
It's lost.

1182
01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:13.080
I.. I used to make notes. Here.

1183
01:35:13.113 --> 01:35:16.283
- Mm-hm.
- There's no more notes.

1184
01:35:17.785 --> 01:35:20.087
I'm sorry.
Really. I'm sorry.

1185
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.456
Listen. Without that recording,

1186
01:35:22.489 --> 01:35:24.225
there's no case against Sealman.

1187
01:35:25.893 --> 01:35:28.262
And there's nothing that I
or anybody can do about it.

1188
01:35:28.295 --> 01:35:29.830
Do you understand that?

1189
01:35:32.299 --> 01:35:34.735
I need you to remember.

1190
01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:48.816
Dr. Myers. I have a writ..

1191
01:35:48.849 --> 01:35:51.252
I know, we got a call
you were coming.

1192
01:36:25.919 --> 01:36:29.490
No alcohol swab?

1193
01:36:48.208 --> 01:36:50.110
Hey, hold up.

1194
01:36:50.144 --> 01:36:51.584
Your SAC said,
he doesn't go through.

1195
01:36:51.613 --> 01:36:53.213
- He's with us.
- Can't do it.

1196
01:36:53.247 --> 01:36:55.049
He said for you
to head right in.

1197
01:36:55.082 --> 01:36:58.520
It's okay, man.
Just take care.

1198
01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:09.363
He's got a hostage.

1199
01:37:09.396 --> 01:37:11.832
This is a fucking mess, Serra.

1200
01:37:19.373 --> 01:37:21.442
His only demand...

1201
01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:23.344
is to talk to you.

1202
01:37:36.056 --> 01:37:38.192
Hey.

1203
01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:40.060
Watch your ass.

1204
01:38:14.962 --> 01:38:16.664
They're coming out.

1205
01:38:16.698 --> 01:38:18.465
Hold fire.

1206
01:38:22.704 --> 01:38:24.539
That's Myers.

1207
01:38:24.572 --> 01:38:27.908
Sniper two, do you have a shot
on the subject on the right?

1208
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:31.044
Affirmative.

1209
01:38:34.248 --> 01:38:35.717
Agent Serra, status?

1210
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.719
You killed the hostage.
Stand down. Stand down!

1211
01:38:37.752 --> 01:38:39.687
Listen to me, Agent Serra,
tactical..

1212
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:43.157
They sent that man to kill me.

1213
01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:45.292
He walked right past the cops.

1214
01:38:45.325 --> 01:38:47.562
That bitch owns the whole game.

1215
01:38:47.595 --> 01:38:49.296
She doesn't own the FBI.

1216
01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:53.611
- Are you sure about that?
- Listen to me.

1217
01:38:53.635 --> 01:38:55.603
Maybe they'll kill you, too.
Just to...

1218
01:38:55.637 --> 01:38:57.539
Just to b.. B.. Bury this.

1219
01:38:57.572 --> 01:39:00.007
Yeah, maybe. Alex. Listen..

1220
01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:05.145
Bery. That's spelled B-E-R-Y.

1221
01:39:05.179 --> 01:39:08.215
- No. Alex.
- Right? Yes. Yes. Bery.

1222
01:39:08.248 --> 01:39:10.317
B-E-R-Y.

1223
01:39:11.653 --> 01:39:14.622
You said justice
can't be guaranteed.

1224
01:39:14.656 --> 01:39:16.223
No.

1225
01:39:16.256 --> 01:39:19.293
We owe it to that child,
Vincent.

1226
01:39:21.796 --> 01:39:24.064
Alex.

1227
01:39:24.097 --> 01:39:26.668
Alex! Alex!

1228
01:40:10.377 --> 01:40:12.279
They won't let Hugo
in the building.

1229
01:40:12.312 --> 01:40:14.114
God, I bet Nussbaum deports him.

1230
01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:17.017
Yeah.
Nothing would surprise me.

1231
01:40:18.352 --> 01:40:19.754
Where are they sending you?

1232
01:40:19.787 --> 01:40:21.723
Crimes against Children.

1233
01:40:21.756 --> 01:40:24.391
- You?
- Unassigned.

1234
01:40:24.424 --> 01:40:27.294
Vincent, your heart
was in the right place.

1235
01:40:41.609 --> 01:40:43.745
He fucking remembered.

1236
01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:45.613
He fucking remembered!

1237
01:41:10.872 --> 01:41:13.140
You've left me no choice.

1238
01:41:13.173 --> 01:41:15.175
I won't be cut out.

1239
01:41:15.208 --> 01:41:16.452
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

1240
01:41:16.476 --> 01:41:18.345
Blackmail is already ugly.

1241
01:41:18.378 --> 01:41:20.715
- Look, all..
- Mr. Van Camp!

1242
01:41:20.748 --> 01:41:22.584
We are not negotiating.

1243
01:41:22.617 --> 01:41:25.452
You've crossed the line
from which there is no return.

1244
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:28.656
That's it.

1245
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:30.758
It's not enough.

1246
01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:32.259
What are you talking about?

1247
01:41:32.292 --> 01:41:33.528
Well, Alex Lewis is dead.

1248
01:41:33.561 --> 01:41:35.262
Without him,
I don't have corroboration.

1249
01:41:35.295 --> 01:41:36.607
You said, if I bring you
this recording..

1250
01:41:36.631 --> 01:41:40.167
No, no, no, no. The recording
is a threat. Yes.

1251
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.736
Without the hitman,
it's not enough.

1252
01:41:41.769 --> 01:41:43.605
Come on, man, this is a case.

1253
01:41:43.638 --> 01:41:45.607
It's not a case I can win.

1254
01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.609
I'm very sorry, Vincent.

1255
01:41:53.881 --> 01:41:55.349
You're kidding me?

1256
01:41:55.382 --> 01:41:58.452
Look, when you're dealing
with that kind of money,

1257
01:41:58.485 --> 01:42:00.822
even if I had her
handing the gun to Alex

1258
01:42:00.855 --> 01:42:03.725
and paying him,
she'd probably still win.

1259
01:42:04.726 --> 01:42:07.160
Okay. Okay.

1260
01:42:07.194 --> 01:42:10.130
Yeah, the sooner you
realize that, the better.

1261
01:42:11.198 --> 01:42:12.667
Listen, you tell me something.

1262
01:42:13.868 --> 01:42:16.336
Beatriz Leon.

1263
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:18.271
What does she mean to you, huh?

1264
01:42:18.305 --> 01:42:20.374
Just some lowlife Mexican kid,

1265
01:42:20.407 --> 01:42:21.909
who's probably gonna die anyway?

1266
01:42:21.943 --> 01:42:23.276
No, not at all.

1267
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:24.646
Randy Sealman
would take children

1268
01:42:24.679 --> 01:42:25.780
out of his Detention Centre

1269
01:42:25.813 --> 01:42:27.314
and use them
as his fucking sex toys.

1270
01:42:27.347 --> 01:42:28.816
Problem is, we can't prove it.

1271
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:31.451
You know what's going on.
We all know what's going on.

1272
01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:32.319
Serra!

1273
01:42:32.352 --> 01:42:33.788
You're nothing
but a fucking coward.

1274
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:35.355
Okay, that's it, Serra!

1275
01:42:35.389 --> 01:42:37.792
A lot of people,
myself included, are fed up!

1276
01:42:37.825 --> 01:42:39.292
Yeah.

1277
01:42:39.326 --> 01:42:41.294
Time to take a leave, Serra.

1278
01:42:41.328 --> 01:42:43.397
Make it a long one.

1279
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:45.967
And then let's re-evaluate.

1280
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.102
With pleasure.

1281
01:43:06.954 --> 01:43:08.623
- Yo.
- Hey.

1282
01:43:08.656 --> 01:43:10.892
We should celebrate
your suspension.

1283
01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:12.694
I'm not really up for it.

1284
01:43:12.727 --> 01:43:14.696
I wasn't asking, dipshit.

1285
01:43:14.729 --> 01:43:16.698
Get some fucking clothes on.

1286
01:43:42.623 --> 01:43:44.491
Since when have you
been so social?

1287
01:43:44.525 --> 01:43:46.460
I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

1288
01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:48.996
I mean, you can't be an
asshole forever, right?

1289
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:50.598
I don't know.

1290
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:37.545
- Hey!
- No, no, no.

1291
01:44:37.578 --> 01:44:40.081
Anymore and I'm fucking
toast tomorrow.

1292
01:44:40.114 --> 01:44:41.816
Don't be a pussy.

1293
01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:43.851
It's not like you've got a job.

1294
01:44:43.885 --> 01:44:46.521
I'm good.

1295
01:44:46.554 --> 01:44:47.722
Alright.

1296
01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:52.292
Oh, shit.
I spaced my wallet.

1297
01:44:53.694 --> 01:44:55.797
Sorry. I'll owe you.

1298
01:44:56.731 --> 01:44:58.365
Asshole.

1299
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.335
Sol?

1300
01:45:02.369 --> 01:45:04.872
...murdered
just hours ago at her home.

1301
01:45:04.906 --> 01:45:07.340
According to an El Paso
Police Department spokesmen,

1302
01:45:07.374 --> 01:45:09.677
there are presently no suspects
and no witnesses.

1303
01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:12.947
Details are sketchy at this
point. El Paso Police only...

1304
01:45:20.087 --> 01:45:21.421
What's going on?

1305
01:45:29.096 --> 01:45:31.398
Did you just give me an alibi?

1306
01:45:32.867 --> 01:45:34.569
Amen.
