1
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.535
Ooh.

2
00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.252
Fuck.

3
00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:18.706
Uhh!

4
00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:34.822
Unh!

5
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.791
Ahh!

6
00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.263
Fuck!

7
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.838
Ah, fuck!

8
00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.460
Ah! Ahh!

9
00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:03.644
<i>Well done, you...</i>

10
00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.380
<i>Well done. You're the winner.</i>

11
00:04:07.582 --> 00:04:10.417
<i>Remind me. Are you the original
or the double?</i>

12
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.523
<i>The double.</i>

13
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:18.926
<i>Of course.
I always get mixed up.</i>

14
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.362
<i>Obviously it gets confusing
when you both look identical.</i>

15
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.832
<i>Excellent work negating
his ranged attack</i>

16
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.601
<i>and closing the distance.</i>

17
00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:30.872
<i>Thank you.</i>

18
00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.809
<i>The double has won the duel.</i>

19
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.944
<i>He's Robert Michaels now.</i>

20
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.865
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

21
00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.535
Yes, I'll have
one two-layer taco,

22
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.703
two soft tacos,

23
00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:05.540
a double burrito,
and an order of nachos.

24
00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:06.841
<i>WHICH ONE?</i>

25
00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:08.509
<i>We have several kinds of nachos.</i>

26
00:05:08.543 --> 00:05:10.611
The one that's just
the chips and cheese dip.

27
00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.680
<i>How many drinks for this order?</i>

28
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.414
Only one.

29
00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.611
<i>I don't know. It's haunted.</i>

30
00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:45.847
<i>But look, there's a pool.</i>

31
00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.519
<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>

32
00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:52.920
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

33
00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.683
Well, hello.

34
00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:24.852
<i>Hey, sweetheart.
What are you up to?</i>

35
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.587
Just watching television.

36
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:27.822
<i>What are you watching?</i>

37
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.628
A reality competition
show about dating.

38
00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.563
<i>That doesn't sound very good.</i>

39
00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.065
It isn't very good, but
I consider it a guilty pleasure.

40
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:39.867
What are you doing?

41
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.536
<i>I took my team out
for drinks after work tonight.</i>

42
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.805
<i>They've been doing such
a great job on this project.</i>

43
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.574
What about
that co-worker of yours

44
00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.676
you were telling me about? Sam?

45
00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.678
Is he still struggling
with the workload?

46
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.547
<i>Actually, Sam's doing
tremendous now.</i>

47
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:55.549
Oh. Oh, that's good, I guess.

48
00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:57.585
<i>In fact, I'm even
considering giving him</i>

49
00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.053
<i>a most-improved award.</i>

50
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.766
<i>Awards in the workplace
have been proven...</i>

51
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.561
<i>increase morale even if it-if...</i>

52
00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:09.530
<i>it d-d-d...
Really mean anything.</i>

53
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.568
I miss you.

54
00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:17.838
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

55
00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:20.908
<i>Maybe I'll call you
one more time before bed?</i>

56
00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:22.610
No, that's okay.

57
00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.612
I actually think I'm going
to go to bed soon, too.

58
00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.647
<i>Really? It's so early there.</i>

59
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:27.982
Yes, but I'm tired.

60
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.789
<i>All right, well, you should
definitely get some rest,</i>

61
00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:36.090
<i>and we can talk tomorrow.</i>

62
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:39.760
I'll text you when I wake up.

63
00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:41.762
<i>All right. Good night, Sarah.</i>

64
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.883
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!</i>

65
00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:04.852
Sarah, dear,
are you really hungry?

66
00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.620
Or are you putting food
into your mouth

67
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:08.122
so you don't have to talk to me?

68
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:10.925
I'm just a normal
amount of hungry.

69
00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:14.095
It's possible to eat and have
a conversation at the same time.

70
00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.898
- I think I'm going to be...
- Sarah...

71
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.942
I think I'm going to be
late for work.

72
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:31.145
You don't have work today.
That's why you're here with me.

73
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.080
What day is it?

74
00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:35.049
Do you remember these?

75
00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:36.884
My penny collection?

76
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:38.719
Why did you stop collecting?

77
00:08:39.153 --> 00:08:41.589
I was 10, I took
on other hobbies.

78
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:42.722
Where did you find these?

79
00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.592
Why aren't you happy anymore?

80
00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:47.595
I am happy.

81
00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.096
Why don't you answer my calls?

82
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.705
Why don't you visit me?

83
00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.143
Don't you love me?

84
00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:24.632
Goodbye, Sarah.

85
00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:46.947
Ma'am, I said, is it
an emergency, or can you wait?

86
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.784
No, it's not an emergency.

87
00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:55.789
Fill out as much of this form
as you can, initial this,

88
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.583
and the yellow page
gives us permission to...

89
00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:06.267
Ma'am, I thought you said
this wasn't an emergency.

90
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:12.339
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

91
00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:15.209
I'm feeling okay.
I haven't had any more episodes.

92
00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:17.077
<i>That's good news.</i>

93
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:20.014
<i>Does this mean
you'll be coming home early?</i>

94
00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:22.783
<i>You know I can't
do that, sweetheart.</i>

95
00:11:23.117 --> 00:11:25.786
<i>We're at a very critical stage
of the project.</i>

96
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.956
No, I know. I just
thought you might be able to...

97
00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:30.791
step away for a moment.

98
00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.259
<i>Perhaps.</i>

99
00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:34.261
<i>I need to figure
some things out here first.</i>

100
00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:36.397
I understand.

101
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.834
<i>Hey, what did
the gastroenterologist say?</i>

102
00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:43.103
She's still running tests.

103
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.239
Everyone is having
a hard time believing me

104
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:48.008
that there were no signs
or symptoms leading up to this.

105
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.979
Who was that?

106
00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:53.914
<i>Aw, nothing. It was just...</i>

107
00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:56.016
<i>Sam texted me
that he got home safely.</i>

108
00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.185
You went out with
your co-workers tonight?

109
00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:00.287
<i>No, no, no. Just Sam.</i>

110
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:03.023
<i>He accidentally drank
too much, though.</i>

111
00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:04.992
<i>I sent him home in a taxi.</i>

112
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:07.928
<i>What are you up to tonight?</i>

113
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.866
I'm in the hospital.

114
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.436
<i>Right, right... I mean...</i>

115
00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:18.372
<i>Do you think you can
go to bed soon?</i>

116
00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:21.141
Yes, I probably should.

117
00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:23.911
I'm supposed to get
an endoscopy tomorrow morning.

118
00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:25.412
I forgot to tell you about that.

119
00:12:26.947 --> 00:12:28.925
They didn't let me eat
or drink anything for dinner,

120
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:30.951
so I'm quite hungry and thirsty.

121
00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:33.465
You can probably hear my stomach
growling louder than my voice.

122
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.492
<i>Mm. Mm.</i>

123
00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:40.828
<i>That's good.
You should get some sleep.</i>

124
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.863
Oh, okay.

125
00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:44.298
<i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

126
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:46.166
Good night, Peter.

127
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:54.141
We're sending you home.

128
00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:56.877
So there's nothing
wrong with me?

129
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.014
No, there most definitely
is something wrong with you,

130
00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:02.182
but while we wait
for the current round of tests

131
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:05.252
to come back,
there's nothing more to be done.

132
00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:09.390
You'd be better off being around
your family and friends.

133
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.425
I haven't told my mom yet.

134
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.193
I wanted to wait until
I had a better idea

135
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.461
of what was happening.

136
00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.196
I feel much better, actually.

137
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.998
Maybe I'm getting better.

138
00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:20.901
Sarah, listen very carefully.

139
00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.237
We may be in the dark here
on what exactly

140
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.407
is happening inside of you,
but whatever it is,

141
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.309
it's very serious.

142
00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:31.378
When you go home,
you need to rest.

143
00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:33.380
You need to take
care of yourself.

144
00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:36.283
You need to not drink.

145
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:38.520
Do you understand?

146
00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:41.455
I understand.

147
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.458
<i>Very good.</i>

148
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.430
<i>That's very, very good.</i>

149
00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.137
<i>Hey, it's Peter.
Leave a message.</i>

150
00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.372
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

151
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:40.073
Guess what I just did?

152
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:41.475
<i>I'm not sure. Tell me.</i>

153
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:43.277
I just went to the gym.

154
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.489
The doctor told me to rest,
but I woke up feeling energized,

155
00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:47.314
and so I decided
to go and work out,

156
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.416
and I got very sweaty and hot,

157
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.251
so the second I walked
through the door,

158
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:53.220
I took off all my clothes.

159
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.528
I actually feel a lot better
than I have in a long time.

160
00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:03.464
I don't think I'm sick anymore.
It was probably just a cold.

161
00:16:03.497 --> 00:16:04.775
I looked up the symptoms online,

162
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:06.967
and that was one of
the possibilities.

163
00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:08.670
What's wrong?

164
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.678
<i>You... You have a rare
condition, and it's terminal.</i>

165
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:20.347
You're just imagining the worst.
I'm fine, I promise.

166
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:22.550
<i>You accidentally
put my number down</i>

167
00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.452
<i>on the primary contact
instead of emergency contacts,</i>

168
00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:27.387
<i>so your doctor's
been calling me,</i>

169
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.456
<i>but I assumed it was
a telemarketer,</i>

170
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.358
<i>so I didn't answer.</i>

171
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:33.528
<i>She must have assumed that
you're screening your calls</i>

172
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:36.531
<i>because she left a very
detailed voicemail in my inbox.</i>

173
00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:44.572
You're telling me
this on video chat?

174
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:47.274
<i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

175
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.613
How long have you known?

176
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:56.651
<i>Two days.
I didn't know how to tell you.</i>

177
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.289
<i>Sarah, you're going to die.</i>

178
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.632
Why aren't I crying?

179
00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:19.674
I apologize for the voicemail.

180
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:23.210
If we could keep this mix-up

181
00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.311
from making its way
to the board of directors,

182
00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.281
I would appreciate it.

183
00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:30.250
Sure, that's fine.

184
00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:35.590
So, yes, you have an incredibly
rare incurable disease.

185
00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:37.725
It is inside your stomach,

186
00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:40.728
but will eventually spread
throughout your body.

187
00:17:40.762 --> 00:17:44.331
It will be painless,
but it is killing you.

188
00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.601
We cannot know how
long you have,

189
00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:49.604
but it is only a matter of time.

190
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.275
What are my chances?

191
00:17:56.644 --> 00:17:58.211
Zero.

192
00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.747
There's a 98% chance

193
00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:02.382
you will succumb
to your illness.

194
00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:05.352
I thought you said
there isn't a chance.

195
00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:06.554
There isn't.

196
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:08.388
Then what about the two percent?

197
00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:12.359
That's the margin of error.
There's a 2% margin of error.

198
00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:14.461
Nothing is ever
absolutely certain,

199
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.798
though this most certainly is.

200
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.335
You're telling me there is a
margin of error of two percent,

201
00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:23.470
but you're certain
I'm definitely going to die?

202
00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:24.672
Yes.

203
00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:26.708
Unfortunately.

204
00:18:27.642 --> 00:18:30.645
You're taking this quite well,
I might add.

205
00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:34.181
Most people cry
when doctors give them bad news,

206
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:37.184
which is why most
doctors are depressed.

207
00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:40.521
I don't want to die,

208
00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:42.523
but it sounds like
it's not up to me.

209
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.793
To use a baseball analogy,

210
00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:48.462
life has thrown
you a curve ball.

211
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.199
Curve balls are tricky throws
for the batter to hit.

212
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.334
In this case, you're the batter.

213
00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:58.338
Only, you're not even holding
a bat, so you most definitely

214
00:18:58.372 --> 00:19:00.675
are going to miss the ball.

215
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.712
What's next?
What are my options?

216
00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:08.783
You should decide on
what type of funeral you want.

217
00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.418
It usually depends
on one's religious views,

218
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:15.322
but it can also be a reflection
of your personality.

219
00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:18.626
For example, I know
I want to be buried,

220
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.494
not because I'm religious,

221
00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:24.666
but because I'm afraid
of being forgotten.

222
00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:27.802
I want my friends and family
to feel obligated

223
00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.704
to come and visit my grave.

224
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.807
Of course, there are the remains

225
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.643
from a cremation
that can be buried or interred,

226
00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:40.447
but people are less likely
to visit a pile of ashes.

227
00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:44.384
A body in a casket holds
more of an obligation.

228
00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:46.821
You can even be buried at sea,

229
00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:49.590
though that's usually
reserved for sailors.

230
00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:52.527
There are many options
to choose from.

231
00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:59.499
I'll probably choose...
cremation.

232
00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:04.739
Then there is the decision
of whether or not

233
00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:07.675
you want to go ahead
with replacement.

234
00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:12.479
I'm sure you're already
familiar with the process.

235
00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:14.582
When you know
you're going to die,

236
00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:16.483
you can have yourself cloned

237
00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:20.487
so that your loved ones won't
have to suffer the loss of you.

238
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:23.624
Here's a pamphlet, just in case.

239
00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:25.325
Thank you.

240
00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:28.462
Remember to discuss it
with your loved ones first.

241
00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.631
Replacement isn't for everyone.

242
00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:34.434
For some families, it has even
been a negative experience.

243
00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:37.538
- Can I have this?
- Please.

244
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.562
<i>Hi, there. My name is Tom.</i>

245
00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:04.364
<i>I'm the head West Coast
media relations officer</i>

246
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:05.867
<i>here at The Facility.</i>

247
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.835
<i>I'll be your host
for this introduction</i>

248
00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:09.871
<i>to the world of replacement.</i>

249
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.540
<i>Of course, we all know
that cloning began dur...</i>

250
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.407
<i>Our scientists have made</i>

251
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.444
<i>countless exciting
breakthroughs and advances</i>

252
00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.914
<i>in The Facility's
proprietary technology.</i>

253
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.416
<i>It's hard to imagine
that, at one point,</i>

254
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.385
<i>this all seemed like
absurd science fiction.</i>

255
00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:26.854
<i>This period is known</i>

256
00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:28.656
<i>as "imprintation".</i>

257
00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:31.826
<i>Your double is more or less
a sponge at this point.</i>

258
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.463
<i>They will soak up as much
of what makes you "you"</i>

259
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.800
<i>as they can before you die.</i>

260
00:21:42.503 --> 00:21:44.505
<i>Down to the littlest detail.</i>

261
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.443
<i>The more time your double
spends learning about you,</i>

262
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.613
the more "you" they will become.

263
00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:01.756
<i>In some cases, however,</i>

264
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:04.859
<i>your double may only have
a very short time with you.</i>

265
00:22:04.892 --> 00:22:08.428
<i>Such as in the case
of premeditated suicide.</i>

266
00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:13.466
<i>For originals who are very sad,</i>

267
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.435
<i>everyday living is a struggle.</i>

268
00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:19.807
<i>This double may look
just like his original,</i>

269
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:22.944
<i>but he may as well be
a different person altogether.</i>

270
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:26.446
<i>For some grieving families,
this is sufficient.</i>

271
00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:30.852
<i>I hope you found this video
fun and informative.</i>

272
00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:33.486
<i>You may be dying,
but don't let that affect</i>

273
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:35.022
<i>those who love you most.</i>

274
00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:37.592
<i>Replacement is a gift to them.</i>

275
00:22:37.925 --> 00:22:39.694
<i>Isn't that right, darling?</i>

276
00:22:41.662 --> 00:22:43.030
<i>That's right.</i>

277
00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:44.899
<i>I'm a former double,</i>

278
00:22:44.932 --> 00:22:47.702
<i>going on 12 years of being Tom.</i>

279
00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.840
<i>Replacement works.</i>

280
00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:11.893
Hi, I'm currently dying

281
00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:14.595
and I would like
to schedule a consultation.

282
00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:07.581
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I forgot to ask you

283
00:24:07.615 --> 00:24:09.617
for some sort of
proof you're dying.

284
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.061
They should have
mentioned that on the phone

285
00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:12.753
when you scheduled
your appointment.

286
00:24:12.787 --> 00:24:15.589
Yes, they told me. I have a copy
of my hospital charts.

287
00:24:15.623 --> 00:24:17.792
I can have my doctor fax
a note too if necessary.

288
00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:19.226
No, the charts will do.

289
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.038
I'm still not sure
I'm going to go through with it.

290
00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:23.106
I'd like to talk to someone
first, if that's all right.

291
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.533
Of course. You still have
to fill out the form, though.

292
00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:27.234
Of course.

293
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:32.073
There's no way
I can afford this.

294
00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:35.977
You must understand that this
is a gift for your loved ones.

295
00:24:36.677 --> 00:24:39.113
Can you put a price on them
not having to be sad?

296
00:24:40.081 --> 00:24:41.983
You're going to die.

297
00:24:42.016 --> 00:24:45.853
And we understand and are
sensitive to that inevitability.

298
00:24:45.886 --> 00:24:48.155
What we do is we set up
a payment plan.

299
00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:51.692
When you pass away
and your double becomes you,

300
00:24:51.726 --> 00:24:53.861
they take over
your responsibilities,

301
00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:55.696
and one of those
responsibilities

302
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.932
is to keep paying
off the procedure.

303
00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:00.167
The most important thing is

304
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:02.803
that you don't have
to worry about anything.

305
00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:05.639
Other than dying with dignity.

306
00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:11.112
I'm afraid of needles,
and I sometimes have nightmares

307
00:25:11.145 --> 00:25:12.546
of being put under anesthesia

308
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.682
but waking up during
the surgery.

309
00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:18.686
All you have to do
is spit into this.

310
00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:21.122
How long does it all take?

311
00:25:21.155 --> 00:25:22.723
About an hour.

312
00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:26.127
Can I get you a refill?

313
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.962
Yes, please, but only half.

314
00:25:27.995 --> 00:25:29.663
I don't need a whole glass.

315
00:25:47.014 --> 00:25:48.182
Hello.

316
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.085
Hi. You must be Sarah.

317
00:25:51.118 --> 00:25:52.953
I caught a glimpse
of myself in the mirror,

318
00:25:52.987 --> 00:25:54.688
and I look a lot like you.

319
00:25:55.856 --> 00:25:57.892
Yes, I'm Sarah.

320
00:26:01.929 --> 00:26:05.099
So, Sarah is your original.

321
00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:08.702
For now, you'll go by the name
Sarah's Double.

322
00:26:08.736 --> 00:26:10.938
When you replace her,
you'll take her name.

323
00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:15.009
You have very clean skin.

324
00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:17.278
And your hair shines
in the light better than mine.

325
00:26:21.015 --> 00:26:22.683
I like your shirt.

326
00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:26.720
I should tell you
that there was an error

327
00:26:26.754 --> 00:26:28.689
in the coding process.

328
00:26:28.722 --> 00:26:30.658
It affected the gene
that determines eye color.

329
00:26:31.692 --> 00:26:34.128
We're happy to decommission
this double and try again

330
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.896
if you'd like.

331
00:26:37.965 --> 00:26:40.000
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

332
00:26:40.034 --> 00:26:41.836
Blue eyes are less common
and more interesting

333
00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:43.337
than brown eyes.

334
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.706
Great. We'll give you
a five-percent discount

335
00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:48.008
on the process to
make it up to you.

336
00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:50.277
Oh, that would be wonderful.

337
00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:53.781
Before he put me in these
temporary clothes,

338
00:26:53.814 --> 00:26:55.249
the technician made a joke to me

339
00:26:55.282 --> 00:26:57.184
about how now he's
seen you naked.

340
00:26:59.053 --> 00:27:00.754
Are you hungry?

341
00:27:00.788 --> 00:27:02.990
Not right now.

342
00:27:03.023 --> 00:27:04.725
What are some
of your favorite foods?

343
00:27:07.862 --> 00:27:09.897
I like Mexican food,

344
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.334
Japanese food
and also Indian food.

345
00:27:14.735 --> 00:27:16.137
I can't wait to try those, then.

346
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.706
What is your least
favorite kind of food?

347
00:27:19.807 --> 00:27:21.447
That's a good question.
Maybe French food.

348
00:27:21.475 --> 00:27:23.177
It can be quite heavy.

349
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.279
Is there
a style of music you like best?

350
00:27:26.113 --> 00:27:27.381
I like all kinds of music,

351
00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:29.350
particularly pop, rock,
and hip-hop.

352
00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:32.019
Would you like to
listen any of those right now?

353
00:27:32.052 --> 00:27:34.021
Maybe later.
I'm enjoying this conversation,

354
00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:36.056
and music might make it
hard to hear each other.

355
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.827
Are there any styles of music
you don't like so much?

356
00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:41.729
Country.

357
00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:43.731
And Metal.

358
00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:45.733
It's just a bunch of noise.

359
00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.247
Welcome home.

360
00:28:00.281 --> 00:28:03.083
It's nice.
Do you live here alone?

361
00:28:03.117 --> 00:28:05.219
No, I live here
with my boyfriend, Peter.

362
00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:06.787
He's away on business, though.

363
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.198
He won't be back
for several more weeks.

364
00:28:08.222 --> 00:28:10.291
I hope I get to see him again
before I die.

365
00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:13.160
He's very handsome
and hard-working.

366
00:28:13.827 --> 00:28:16.797
He sounds like it.
I'm excited to meet him.

367
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.832
I'll introduce you
to my mom, too.

368
00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.100
What about your dad?

369
00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.169
He passed away a few years ago.

370
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.906
50 percent of marriages
end in divorce, but...

371
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.975
my parents were still together
when he died.

372
00:28:28.008 --> 00:28:29.777
I never saw them fight.

373
00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:31.812
I know she misses him.

374
00:28:31.845 --> 00:28:33.847
I'm excited to meet your mom.

375
00:28:35.216 --> 00:28:37.184
I haven't told
her about you yet.

376
00:28:37.218 --> 00:28:39.253
I haven't told Peter either,
but I'm going to.

377
00:28:39.286 --> 00:28:41.922
Actually, I'm not sure I want
my mom to know I'm sick.

378
00:28:41.956 --> 00:28:43.324
I'm afraid she'll be sad.

379
00:28:43.357 --> 00:28:45.025
I'm her only child.

380
00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:46.360
When you're gone,

381
00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:48.395
I promise to love her
as much as you do.

382
00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:49.997
Maybe more.

383
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.265
Same for Peter.

384
00:28:51.298 --> 00:28:53.067
I will love him so much.

385
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:55.903
Let's get some clothes for you.

386
00:29:07.348 --> 00:29:10.351
You don't have any cellulite
or love handles.

387
00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:14.154
I guess I don't have
either of those things.

388
00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:15.322
You're right.

389
00:29:16.323 --> 00:29:18.225
Feels slightly loose on me.

390
00:29:20.027 --> 00:29:22.062
I may be a size
smaller than you.

391
00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:23.440
You should probably
take me shopping.

392
00:29:23.464 --> 00:29:25.332
What's your favorite
sexual position?

393
00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:29.169
Um, it's boring,
but I like missionary.

394
00:29:29.937 --> 00:29:32.239
Sometimes, it's nice
to be choked. Lightly.

395
00:29:32.873 --> 00:29:34.441
What's Peter's
favorite position?

396
00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:38.178
He likes standing
both from behind

397
00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:41.215
and facing each other,
and he likes to blindfold me,

398
00:29:41.248 --> 00:29:43.183
but I like to be able
to see him, though.

399
00:29:43.217 --> 00:29:45.319
Sure, but I imagine
not being able to see

400
00:29:45.352 --> 00:29:47.021
heightens the other senses.

401
00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:49.857
You know, I don't think
I care for this top.

402
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.450
Maybe when you take me shopping,
I'll look for a different style.

403
00:29:58.432 --> 00:30:01.068
Sweetheart,
have you seen my shoes?

404
00:30:01.101 --> 00:30:03.137
Uh, are they these black ones?

405
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.905
No, those are Sarah's.

406
00:30:04.938 --> 00:30:08.309
Mine are tan and
more fashionable.

407
00:30:08.342 --> 00:30:10.010
Never mind. I found them.

408
00:30:10.044 --> 00:30:12.079
They were by the door
where I usually leave them.

409
00:30:12.112 --> 00:30:14.081
Wow, sweetheart,

410
00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:16.250
you look beautiful.

411
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.253
So do you.

412
00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:29.163
Which restaurant
are we going to?

413
00:30:29.196 --> 00:30:31.965
We are going
to a French brasserie.

414
00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.967
French food is my favorite.

415
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.238
Oh, hey, Sarah.

416
00:30:38.272 --> 00:30:40.040
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

417
00:30:40.074 --> 00:30:42.009
Peter and I are going on a date.

418
00:30:42.042 --> 00:30:44.512
I think we all knew there was
something between Peter and me.

419
00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:47.314
So, it's nice
to just be open about it.

420
00:30:47.348 --> 00:30:49.249
I really value your friendship.

421
00:30:49.283 --> 00:30:50.951
I'll miss that when you die.

422
00:30:50.984 --> 00:30:53.487
Speaking of which, any updates?

423
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.125
I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow.

424
00:30:58.158 --> 00:31:00.260
Honey, we should hurry,
or we're going to be late.

425
00:31:00.294 --> 00:31:01.495
Okay.

426
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:06.534
Peter and I will probably make
love when we get home tonight.

427
00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:10.070
As you know, I tend to be loud,
so I wanted you to be aware.

428
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.315
Please, come in.

429
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:23.317
Have a seat.

430
00:31:26.086 --> 00:31:27.421
How are you feeling?

431
00:31:27.454 --> 00:31:29.289
I feel okay.

432
00:31:29.323 --> 00:31:31.301
It's been completely painless,
just as you said it would be.

433
00:31:31.325 --> 00:31:33.160
The worst part has
been the waiting.

434
00:31:33.193 --> 00:31:35.062
I know it's coming,
but I don't know when.

435
00:31:35.462 --> 00:31:37.231
I go to sleep every
night thinking,

436
00:31:37.264 --> 00:31:39.567
"Maybe tomorrow will be
the day I don't wake up."

437
00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:42.069
I'd rather die in my sleep
than die awake.

438
00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:44.371
I'd rather not be able
to feel it happening.

439
00:31:44.405 --> 00:31:47.274
Sarah, I don't know
how to tell you this,

440
00:31:47.307 --> 00:31:50.043
other than direct
and to the point.

441
00:31:51.111 --> 00:31:53.247
You've gone into
complete remission.

442
00:31:54.214 --> 00:31:56.150
You're not dying anymore.

443
00:31:58.218 --> 00:32:00.120
You told me it was certain.

444
00:32:00.154 --> 00:32:03.123
I did mention
the margin of error.

445
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:05.492
Are you sure?

446
00:32:05.527 --> 00:32:07.595
My stomach is hurting
a little bit right now.

447
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:10.397
Did you have anything to
eat for breakfast this morning?

448
00:32:11.398 --> 00:32:13.033
No.

449
00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:15.235
You're most likely
just hungry, then.

450
00:32:16.103 --> 00:32:17.404
I don't understand.

451
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:21.341
To be perfectly honest,
we don't either.

452
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:23.611
But it seems
you've recovered completely

453
00:32:23.645 --> 00:32:26.013
and there's no reason
to think you can't live

454
00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:27.448
a long, fulfilling life.

455
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.018
Your family will be thrilled.

456
00:32:32.453 --> 00:32:34.388
I never told my mom.

457
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.023
Why not?

458
00:32:36.056 --> 00:32:37.725
I didn't want her to worry.

459
00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:40.327
My double was going to take over
like nothing ever happened.

460
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.095
With contact lenses, of course.

461
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:43.464
She wouldn't have to miss me.

462
00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:46.133
You should see The Facility

463
00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:48.101
about having your double
decommissioned.

464
00:32:48.135 --> 00:32:51.104
By law, the only people
who are allowed doubles

465
00:32:51.138 --> 00:32:52.473
are people who are dying,

466
00:32:52.507 --> 00:32:55.275
and you are no longer
one of those people.

467
00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:46.326
We actually went roller-skating.

468
00:33:47.327 --> 00:33:49.631
Oh, it was fun.
I fell, didn't I?

469
00:33:49.664 --> 00:33:52.132
Very badly, but it was fun.

470
00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:55.302
I used to roller skate.
With your father.

471
00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:56.738
Oh.

472
00:33:59.139 --> 00:34:00.608
You introduced her to my mom?

473
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.175
Sarah, what's going on?

474
00:34:02.209 --> 00:34:03.545
Mom, I'm Sarah.

475
00:34:06.714 --> 00:34:08.447
You agreed to wait until I died

476
00:34:08.482 --> 00:34:10.384
before you introduced her
to my mom as me.

477
00:34:10.417 --> 00:34:11.686
Died?

478
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.621
I didn't introduce
your double to your mom.

479
00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:16.558
She's been in contact with her
on her own for months now.

480
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.126
You're pretending to be me?

481
00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.194
While I'm still alive,
you're talking to her?

482
00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:22.597
Someone had to.

483
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.532
All your mother wanted
was a call here and there

484
00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:26.233
from the daughter she loves.

485
00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.735
Sarah, will one of you
please tell me what's happening?

486
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.337
I was dying.

487
00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.371
I had a disease
that was killing me,

488
00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:34.274
and so, I decided
to get a replacement

489
00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:35.748
so that you wouldn't
have to miss me.

490
00:34:36.443 --> 00:34:38.210
Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:40.681
I know. I did this for you.

492
00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:42.516
It was supposed to
be a nice gift.

493
00:34:44.752 --> 00:34:46.554
How much longer do you have?

494
00:34:48.523 --> 00:34:50.489
That's the thing.

495
00:34:50.525 --> 00:34:52.359
It's almost funny.

496
00:34:52.391 --> 00:34:54.293
I did all of this for nothing.

497
00:34:55.797 --> 00:34:57.297
What do you mean?

498
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.234
I'm not going to die after all.

499
00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:03.504
I just left my doctor's office,
and I'm in remission.

500
00:35:04.438 --> 00:35:06.373
You're going to be
decommissioned.

501
00:35:08.543 --> 00:35:10.277
And we can go back
to being together

502
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.212
and everything can
go back to normal.

503
00:35:14.414 --> 00:35:15.626
What do you mean decommissioned?

504
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.884
Don't worry, Mother.

505
00:35:16.918 --> 00:35:18.519
No, don't you fucking
talk to her.

506
00:35:18.553 --> 00:35:21.321
You're done. I am going
to fucking abort you!

507
00:35:21.355 --> 00:35:23.457
- All right, come on.
- I'm Sarah, not you.

508
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.292
You're nothing. You're no one.

509
00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:27.695
Come on, let's go outside.

510
00:35:39.339 --> 00:35:41.676
You're not kissing me.
Here, try again.

511
00:35:41.709 --> 00:35:43.778
- Eh... What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

512
00:35:44.712 --> 00:35:46.246
I'm with her now.

513
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:47.815
Didn't you hear me?

514
00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:49.684
She's going to be
decommissioned.

515
00:35:49.717 --> 00:35:52.687
So... we can go back
to you and me.

516
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.488
It's not that simple.

517
00:35:56.591 --> 00:35:58.325
What is it about her?

518
00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.262
It's little things.

519
00:36:02.764 --> 00:36:04.632
Like her inflection
when she says my name.

520
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:07.769
Hers goes up. Peter!
Yours is flat. Peter.

521
00:36:08.736 --> 00:36:10.772
I can say your name
that way if you want.

522
00:36:11.405 --> 00:36:14.341
Just tell me what you want me
to be, and I'll be it for you.

523
00:36:16.744 --> 00:36:19.312
You always try too hard
to impress new people.

524
00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:20.715
You speak over me or for me.

525
00:36:20.748 --> 00:36:23.350
You have to control
social situations.

526
00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:25.285
I'm embarrassed to
go out with you.

527
00:36:25.318 --> 00:36:26.462
Every time we go out,
my co-workers

528
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:28.388
make fun of you
behind your back.

529
00:36:28.422 --> 00:36:30.333
That is, when I can actually
get you to leave the house,

530
00:36:30.357 --> 00:36:31.793
and even if I do,
it's always on me.

531
00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:33.928
I can't do it anymore.

532
00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:39.399
Even if I can't be with her,
I don't want to be with you.

533
00:36:44.337 --> 00:36:45.707
I love you, Peter.

534
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:48.910
And no one will ever love you
as much as I do.

535
00:36:50.545 --> 00:36:52.312
I know.

536
00:36:52.345 --> 00:36:54.582
But I don't love you anymore.

537
00:36:59.319 --> 00:37:00.655
What's it like to fuck me

538
00:37:00.688 --> 00:37:02.422
while you look into
someone else's eyes?

539
00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:07.294
You need therapy, Sarah.

540
00:37:14.669 --> 00:37:16.904
Wait, this is my mom's house.

541
00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:24.712
Mom? Hey, Mom.

542
00:37:24.746 --> 00:37:26.514
Peter locked me out.

543
00:37:54.842 --> 00:37:58.679
I hope the decommission process
is painful for you, bitch!

544
00:37:58.713 --> 00:38:01.916
And I hope it's emotionally
painful for the two of you!

545
00:38:09.456 --> 00:38:10.691
Hello?

546
00:38:10.725 --> 00:38:12.359
<i>Is this Sarah?</i>

547
00:38:12.392 --> 00:38:13.628
Yes. Who's this?

548
00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:15.062
<i>I represent your double.</i>

549
00:38:15.096 --> 00:38:16.864
<i>This call is to notify you
that she will be</i>

550
00:38:16.898 --> 00:38:18.633
<i>exercising her rights
in accordance</i>

551
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:20.668
<i>with the 28th Amendment
of the Constitution.</i>

552
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:22.837
<i>Your double has filed
a motion to stay.</i>

553
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.806
What do you mean "stay"?

554
00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:26.841
<i>I suggest you
consult with legal counsel.</i>

555
00:38:26.874 --> 00:38:28.643
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

556
00:38:34.982 --> 00:38:37.417
It's a fairly standard
motion to stay.

557
00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:39.854
All the usual stipulations.

558
00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:43.490
No contact with your double
starting immediately.

559
00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:46.003
Because the lease
is in your ex's name,

560
00:38:46.027 --> 00:38:47.662
you're being asked to move out.

561
00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:50.565
They're giving you two days,
which is quite generous,

562
00:38:50.598 --> 00:38:52.365
as usually it's only one.

563
00:38:52.399 --> 00:38:54.769
The duel to the death will be
in approximately one year.

564
00:38:54.802 --> 00:38:57.738
The exact date to be determined
by the court at a later time.

565
00:38:57.772 --> 00:38:59.106
And you'll be expected to pay

566
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.708
support to your double
in the interim.

567
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:02.677
Wait, did you say
duel to the death?

568
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.012
Yes, it is to determine
which of you will live

569
00:39:05.046 --> 00:39:06.614
the rest of Sarah's life.

570
00:39:06.647 --> 00:39:07.991
We can't have two of you
walking around forever.

571
00:39:08.015 --> 00:39:09.617
That would be ridiculous.

572
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.484
I thought she was going
to be decommissioned.

573
00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:12.887
Well, in cases such as yours,

574
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.956
when an original is going
to live after all,

575
00:39:14.989 --> 00:39:17.490
the double is usually
decommissioned, yes.

576
00:39:17.525 --> 00:39:19.527
But, in even rarer cases,

577
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.461
when a double has been
in the world long enough

578
00:39:21.494 --> 00:39:23.030
to start becoming
their own person,

579
00:39:23.064 --> 00:39:25.900
they sometimes would prefer
to continue to live.

580
00:39:25.933 --> 00:39:28.569
They can request a stay
and a duel is set.

581
00:39:28.603 --> 00:39:30.605
I thought the duels
were only for prisoners

582
00:39:30.638 --> 00:39:32.439
who commit the crime
worse than murder.

583
00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:34.041
They're also used for stays.

584
00:39:34.075 --> 00:39:35.810
Haven't even seen
one on television?

585
00:39:35.843 --> 00:39:37.578
They're quite popular.

586
00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:40.781
I don't care for violence.
It makes me nauseous.

587
00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:42.583
Well, you'll need
to get over that

588
00:39:42.617 --> 00:39:44.785
if you want any chance
of surviving your duel.

589
00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.455
I suggest taking personal
combat training lessons

590
00:39:48.488 --> 00:39:49.991
from a personal combat trainer.

591
00:39:50.858 --> 00:39:52.827
Also, we should
discuss my rates.

592
00:40:09.977 --> 00:40:12.647
You can take the sheets with
the giant blood stain on them.

593
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.582
You should have
washed them in cold water.

594
00:40:14.982 --> 00:40:16.951
You can take anything you like.

595
00:40:16.984 --> 00:40:18.986
Your double has
different taste than you,

596
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.955
and we'd like to
redecorate anyway.

597
00:40:20.988 --> 00:40:23.691
Maybe leave the couch, though,
and the nice coffee table.

598
00:40:23.724 --> 00:40:25.826
But other than that,
you can take anything you like.

599
00:40:27.728 --> 00:40:29.030
Hey, sweetheart!

600
00:40:29.063 --> 00:40:30.831
<i>Is she still there?</i>

601
00:40:30.865 --> 00:40:33.634
Yes, she is,
but she's going to be gone soon.

602
00:40:33.668 --> 00:40:35.503
<i>I'm glad I don't have to see</i>

603
00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.071
<i>her disgusting face
again for a while.</i>

604
00:40:37.772 --> 00:40:40.608
<i>Oh, tell her to take
the bloody sheets with her.</i>

605
00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:43.544
Don't worry. I already did.

606
00:40:43.577 --> 00:40:44.845
<i>Good.</i>

607
00:40:46.814 --> 00:40:47.882
<i>I miss you.</i>

608
00:40:48.549 --> 00:40:49.750
I miss you, too.

609
00:41:23.718 --> 00:41:25.786
Do you want to live?

610
00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:30.624
Yes.

611
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.894
I don't believe you.

612
00:41:35.629 --> 00:41:37.064
I want to live.

613
00:41:37.798 --> 00:41:39.900
Because if you know
that you do not care

614
00:41:39.934 --> 00:41:41.769
if you live or die in your duel,

615
00:41:41.802 --> 00:41:43.771
you may as well
tell me right now.

616
00:41:43.804 --> 00:41:47.641
I will tear up your contract,
and you can spend all the money

617
00:41:47.675 --> 00:41:51.012
that you save over the next year
on drugs and alcohol,

618
00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:54.115
vacations to the beach, sex...

619
00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:57.084
trips to amusement parks.

620
00:41:58.786 --> 00:42:00.788
You will surely
die in your duel,

621
00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:02.923
but you will have lived
your last year on Earth

622
00:42:02.957 --> 00:42:06.027
in an excessive
and exciting fashion.

623
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:10.831
I said I want to live.

624
00:42:12.967 --> 00:42:15.036
Are you prepared to kill?

625
00:42:17.038 --> 00:42:18.172
Yes.

626
00:42:20.074 --> 00:42:21.776
I believe you.

627
00:42:24.045 --> 00:42:27.214
First, we need to get
your body healthy and ready...

628
00:42:28.049 --> 00:42:29.683
for what's to come.

629
00:42:32.053 --> 00:42:34.255
We'll start with some
general calisthenics.

630
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.131
Come on.

631
00:43:39.787 --> 00:43:41.222
I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

632
00:43:41.856 --> 00:43:44.225
It's due to all
the lactic acid in your blood.

633
00:43:44.258 --> 00:43:46.293
It's temporarily poisoning you.

634
00:43:47.094 --> 00:43:50.030
Don't worry. The feeling
will go away eventually.

635
00:43:52.867 --> 00:43:54.135
I'm going to live.

636
00:43:54.168 --> 00:43:55.836
This is my life.

637
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.905
She's not going
to take it from me.

638
00:44:03.878 --> 00:44:06.013
I want you to watch
that tonight.

639
00:44:06.046 --> 00:44:08.782
It's not very good,
but there are some images in it

640
00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:10.918
that I want you
to get used to seeing.

641
00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:13.988
I'll see you tomorrow.

642
00:44:46.053 --> 00:44:48.155
<i>Oh, for crying out loud.</i>

643
00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:52.092
<i>Barbara, I told you don't leave
your ring next to the sink.</i>

644
00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:03.170
<i>Got ya.</i>

645
00:45:05.272 --> 00:45:07.341
<i>Barbara, I'm stuck. Barbara!</i>

646
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:14.114
<i>Barbara, quit kidding around.
Barbara, this isn't funny.</i>

647
00:45:17.017 --> 00:45:18.219
<i>Barbara, stop.</i>

648
00:45:20.087 --> 00:45:22.056
<i>Barbara, stop. I'm your husband.</i>

649
00:45:57.458 --> 00:45:59.159
You were right.

650
00:45:59.193 --> 00:46:01.137
The plot was convoluted
and the acting wasn't very good,

651
00:46:01.161 --> 00:46:03.063
but I see why you wanted me
to watch it.

652
00:46:03.097 --> 00:46:05.299
I'll send you home
with the sequel today.

653
00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:08.135
It's a worse film,
but it's even more violent.

654
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:11.872
Are you ready to get started?

655
00:46:39.366 --> 00:46:41.435
It will take place on a field.

656
00:46:42.303 --> 00:46:45.272
Usually a football field
or a soccer field,

657
00:46:45.306 --> 00:46:48.309
or sometimes even a public park,
if there's enough space.

658
00:46:49.143 --> 00:46:52.514
Each opponent will stand
on opposite ends of the field.

659
00:46:53.147 --> 00:46:56.083
An official will signal
for the officials on the field

660
00:46:56.116 --> 00:46:58.986
to remove a sheet
covering a table.

661
00:47:08.028 --> 00:47:12.534
On the table,
there will be five weapons.

662
00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:16.036
Your opponent will have
an identical cache of weapons.

663
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.573
You will have 10 seconds
to choose a weapon.

664
00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:21.008
Your opponent will be
obstructed from view

665
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:23.545
during this 10-second long
decision-making process.

666
00:47:25.112 --> 00:47:28.349
If there is a gun on the table,

667
00:47:28.382 --> 00:47:32.086
it is most likely that both
combatants will choose it.

668
00:47:33.621 --> 00:47:36.223
But guns run out of bullets.

669
00:47:38.425 --> 00:47:42.329
And axe does not need bullets
to slice through an arm.

670
00:47:43.531 --> 00:47:48.068
An axe is much
heavier and slower

671
00:47:48.102 --> 00:47:53.240
than a dagger, which you need
to be in close proximity to use.

672
00:47:53.273 --> 00:47:58.445
So, you see, it is all about
careful yet decisive strategy.

673
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.415
Yes?

674
00:48:01.448 --> 00:48:03.083
What happens
if you drop your weapon

675
00:48:03.117 --> 00:48:05.185
and are too far away from
the table to grab another?

676
00:48:05.452 --> 00:48:07.488
I like that you're
already thinking this way.

677
00:48:07.522 --> 00:48:09.423
How many weapons
do you see here?

678
00:48:11.458 --> 00:48:13.360
Five.

679
00:48:13.394 --> 00:48:15.195
Count again.

680
00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:19.299
I still count five.

681
00:48:20.134 --> 00:48:22.336
There are six weapons.

682
00:48:22.369 --> 00:48:25.573
A properly trained human body
is a weapon.

683
00:48:27.609 --> 00:48:30.645
I would like for you to start
working out on your own time.

684
00:48:30.678 --> 00:48:33.113
This way, we can spend
an entire hour

685
00:48:33.147 --> 00:48:35.349
on weapons training
and hand-to-hand combat.

686
00:48:35.683 --> 00:48:38.252
I'm sometimes unmotivated
to work out on my own.

687
00:48:38.285 --> 00:48:40.588
It's easier when there's
someone there pushing me.

688
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:43.290
The key is finding
something that you enjoy.

689
00:48:43.323 --> 00:48:45.225
There are many activities
that you can do

690
00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:47.562
that are also a great workout
such as bike riding,

691
00:48:47.595 --> 00:48:50.097
rock climbing, dancing,
or even swimming.

692
00:48:50.665 --> 00:48:53.400
Oh, I almost forgot.
I'll get you that DVD.

693
00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:26.694
For number three,
I chose slit throat.

694
00:50:26.728 --> 00:50:28.295
Excellent.

695
00:50:30.732 --> 00:50:31.699
Hm.

696
00:50:31.733 --> 00:50:33.535
Remember, no emotion.

697
00:50:33.568 --> 00:50:34.702
Sorry.

698
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.305
I chose blunt-force trauma
to the head.

699
00:50:42.276 --> 00:50:43.711
I knew this one right away.

700
00:50:43.745 --> 00:50:45.589
This is definitely
a gunshot wound to the chest,

701
00:50:45.613 --> 00:50:47.682
most likely from
a low-caliber weapon.

702
00:50:47.715 --> 00:50:49.584
It has probably
punctured his lung.

703
00:50:49.617 --> 00:50:51.653
Gunshot wound. Good.

704
00:50:54.421 --> 00:50:57.025
Arrow to the head.

705
00:51:00.427 --> 00:51:03.397
- Multiple stab wounds.
- Excellent.

706
00:51:06.834 --> 00:51:08.536
This one was difficult.

707
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.304
I saw you
having trouble with it.

708
00:51:10.337 --> 00:51:11.739
What did you decide on?

709
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.409
I wasn't sure, but I picked...

710
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:18.278
electrocution?

711
00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:20.582
Good guess.

712
00:51:20.615 --> 00:51:22.550
But remember, there would be
visual indicators

713
00:51:22.584 --> 00:51:26.253
such as singed hair or clothing
and burns to the body.

714
00:51:26.286 --> 00:51:28.388
This is a death by poison.

715
00:51:28.422 --> 00:51:30.558
Of course.
I should have known it.

716
00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:34.361
It's okay.
You only missed this one,

717
00:51:34.394 --> 00:51:37.364
and poison is hardly
a weapon chosen by the court,

718
00:51:37.397 --> 00:51:39.867
because it is slow to act
and not as visually exciting.

719
00:51:41.736 --> 00:51:44.471
Once, I accidentally cut myself
with a pair of scissors

720
00:51:44.505 --> 00:51:46.373
while trimming my bangs.

721
00:51:46.406 --> 00:51:47.651
As I washed the wound in
the sink,

722
00:51:47.675 --> 00:51:49.510
it began to bleed,
and I fainted.

723
00:51:49.544 --> 00:51:51.646
I'm lucky I didn't fall
on the scissors.

724
00:51:52.412 --> 00:51:55.248
But now, even a mutilated body
barely phases me.

725
00:51:55.883 --> 00:51:58.586
Photos of a mutilated
human body.

726
00:51:59.621 --> 00:52:01.756
Photos. Yes.

727
00:52:03.558 --> 00:52:05.727
I've set up a field trip
for you next week.

728
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.795
I'm not entirely
sure when it will be

729
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:09.697
due to the nature
of the activity,

730
00:52:09.731 --> 00:52:11.866
but I will let you know
the day before.

731
00:52:11.899 --> 00:52:14.736
By the way, I called the bank
about my card being declined,

732
00:52:14.769 --> 00:52:17.304
I have to pay an overdraft fee,
which is frustrating,

733
00:52:17.337 --> 00:52:19.306
but you should have this month's
payment tomorrow.

734
00:52:19.339 --> 00:52:20.708
Thank you for sorting that out.

735
00:52:20.742 --> 00:52:22.610
Between the personal
combat training,

736
00:52:22.644 --> 00:52:24.378
clone support,
and hip-hop dance classes,

737
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:25.789
money has been
a little tight recently.

738
00:52:25.813 --> 00:52:27.615
I understand.

739
00:52:27.649 --> 00:52:31.552
Sometimes it's possible to pay
for services in other ways.

740
00:52:31.586 --> 00:52:34.388
Maybe we can come up
with some sort of arrangement

741
00:52:34.421 --> 00:52:36.289
that is mutually beneficial.

742
00:52:42.563 --> 00:52:43.865
How much is this?

743
00:52:46.901 --> 00:52:49.336
$2.08 including tax.

744
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.677
Uh, 1 dollar and 34 cents
on pump 2, please.

745
00:53:09.524 --> 00:53:10.892
Hello?

746
00:53:12.426 --> 00:53:13.828
Where is that?

747
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:45.827
Can I help you?

748
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.662
Trent told me to come see you.

749
00:53:48.996 --> 00:53:50.565
Even though it's covered,

750
00:53:50.598 --> 00:53:53.433
I'm sure you can
already tell what this is.

751
00:53:53.467 --> 00:53:54.802
A person.

752
00:53:54.836 --> 00:53:57.004
A body.

753
00:53:57.038 --> 00:54:01.509
This body was once a person,
but now it is just a body.

754
00:54:12.954 --> 00:54:16.490
You'll notice she was
about your age when she died.

755
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:19.861
She has your hair color,
your eye color,

756
00:54:19.894 --> 00:54:21.863
and even looks
a little like you.

757
00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:23.798
Was she killed in a duel?

758
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:25.867
No, she was not.

759
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.669
She was killed
while riding a motorcycle.

760
00:54:30.004 --> 00:54:32.774
Her friends and family say
she was a safe driver.

761
00:54:33.608 --> 00:54:35.610
She was even wearing
a full-face helmet,

762
00:54:35.643 --> 00:54:38.613
but another vehicle
ran a red light.

763
00:54:38.813 --> 00:54:40.882
And struck her head-on.

764
00:54:40.915 --> 00:54:43.483
She was alive for a few minutes.

765
00:54:44.484 --> 00:54:46.521
Witnesses say she even admitted

766
00:54:46.554 --> 00:54:48.723
she should have
purchased a car instead.

767
00:54:49.924 --> 00:54:51.559
What was her name?

768
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.961
That doesn't matter.

769
00:54:54.929 --> 00:54:57.932
First, we need to open up
the chest cavity

770
00:54:57.965 --> 00:54:59.967
and inspect the vital organs.

771
00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:02.970
I'm cutting into the skin...

772
00:55:08.676 --> 00:55:12.013
pulling it back to allow access.

773
00:55:16.918 --> 00:55:19.020
There. Next...

774
00:55:20.855 --> 00:55:24.659
we cut the ribs
surrounding the chest plate.

775
00:55:35.703 --> 00:55:38.806
Then we cut away the cartilage

776
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.075
revealing the heart and...

777
00:55:59.727 --> 00:56:02.897
Bang, bang, bang.
Ah, the gun jammed.

778
00:56:03.097 --> 00:56:05.833
The first two shots missed, but
the last one got me in my side.

779
00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:07.802
It missed my vital
organs, though.

780
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.678
Boom!

781
00:56:17.712 --> 00:56:19.847
Nice thinking.
Destroying my weapons cache

782
00:56:19.881 --> 00:56:21.782
would have definitely
sealed my fate.

783
00:56:31.626 --> 00:56:32.793
Ah!

784
00:56:34.996 --> 00:56:37.832
- Stab.
- Ah! I'm less mobile now.

785
00:56:38.833 --> 00:56:40.635
Stab, stab.

786
00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:42.904
The first stab
punctures my liver.

787
00:56:42.937 --> 00:56:45.940
I will die from this wound,
but not immediately.

788
00:56:46.574 --> 00:56:48.142
It will be slow and painful.

789
00:56:48.175 --> 00:56:50.011
I'm taking you out
with me, though.

790
00:56:50.044 --> 00:56:52.046
Slice.

791
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.948
I'm cut.

792
00:56:54.682 --> 00:56:56.817
I'm bleeding severely,
and, oh, no.

793
00:56:56.851 --> 00:56:58.753
The knife got knocked
out of my hand.

794
00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:04.759
- Ah, ah...
- I block the sword,

795
00:57:04.792 --> 00:57:07.028
and tie up your hands
with the garrotte.

796
00:57:08.095 --> 00:57:10.164
Not only did that
force me to lose my grip,

797
00:57:10.197 --> 00:57:13.134
but it's also slicing into
the radial artery of my wrist.

798
00:57:13.167 --> 00:57:14.602
Ah!

799
00:57:18.005 --> 00:57:21.709
Not only is this cutting off
the blood supply to my brain,

800
00:57:21.742 --> 00:57:24.578
but the wire is
slicing into my flesh.

801
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.715
I'm dead.

802
00:57:31.152 --> 00:57:32.586
Good.

803
00:57:33.955 --> 00:57:35.690
You should have used the gun.

804
00:57:35.723 --> 00:57:37.992
Always use the gun
if it's an option.

805
00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:40.161
I know, I just...

806
00:57:40.194 --> 00:57:42.063
I find guns to be
boring and overused.

807
00:57:42.096 --> 00:57:44.031
I know what you mean,
but if it's the difference

808
00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:46.033
between life and death,
it's okay to be boring.

809
00:57:47.835 --> 00:57:49.637
Only a week to go,
but I would say

810
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:53.207
that you're feeling very strong,
both physically, and mentally,

811
00:57:54.108 --> 00:57:55.977
I'm going to kill her.

812
00:57:57.211 --> 00:57:58.879
I just know it.

813
00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:09.724
Can I help you find anything?

814
00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:11.225
No.

815
00:58:11.258 --> 00:58:12.893
I'm just browsing.

816
00:58:13.127 --> 00:58:15.229
Well, let me know
if I can help in any way.

817
00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:19.000
Wait!

818
00:58:20.134 --> 00:58:22.136
I'm looking for
an outfit to die in.

819
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.673
You're in luck.
We just got some pieces in

820
00:58:25.706 --> 00:58:27.875
for the new season
that are to die for.

821
00:58:27.908 --> 00:58:30.277
No, not to die <i>for.</i> To die <i>in.</i>

822
00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:33.147
I'm looking for an outfit
that if, hypothetically,

823
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.716
I were to die in,
I would be okay with.

824
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.928
Something that reflects my
personality and is functional,

825
00:58:37.952 --> 00:58:40.121
but mainly, I need it
to be flattering to my figure.

826
00:58:40.154 --> 00:58:42.023
I've gotten in shape
over the past year,

827
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:43.991
but I still carry insecurities
about my body.

828
00:58:44.025 --> 00:58:46.093
If I'm going to die, well,

829
00:58:46.127 --> 00:58:48.162
at least I want to do it
looking my best.

830
00:58:49.096 --> 00:58:51.232
I don't care how much it costs.

831
00:58:58.339 --> 00:58:59.940
Fuck!

832
00:59:05.746 --> 00:59:06.914
Shit!

833
00:59:10.317 --> 00:59:12.019
What do you mean, "postponed"?

834
00:59:12.053 --> 00:59:13.687
<i>Due to weather.</i>

835
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:15.089
I don't mind getting wet.

836
00:59:15.122 --> 00:59:16.590
<i>Well, the issue isn't rain.</i>

837
00:59:16.624 --> 00:59:17.934
<i>There's a chance
for thunderstorms.</i>

838
00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.293
Then when?

839
00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:20.795
<i>In a month.</i>

840
00:59:20.828 --> 00:59:21.996
A month.

841
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:23.898
<i>Another thing.</i>

842
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:26.033
<i>This delay is considered
an act of God.</i>

843
00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:28.769
<i>So you'll need to continue
paying support to your double.</i>

844
00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:30.204
<i>- The double.
- Of course.</i>

845
00:59:30.237 --> 00:59:31.839
For another month?

846
00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:34.308
I spent everything
I had yesterday.

847
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:35.976
<i>On what?</i>

848
00:59:36.343 --> 00:59:38.813
An outfit for the duel.

849
00:59:40.314 --> 00:59:41.882
<i>If you default on your payments,</i>

850
00:59:41.916 --> 00:59:43.784
<i>the court will
assign you a handicap.</i>

851
00:59:43.818 --> 00:59:45.395
<i>Such as having to duel with one
arm tied behind your back.</i>

852
00:59:45.419 --> 00:59:47.054
I'll figure something out.

853
00:59:47.088 --> 00:59:48.856
<i>The double has won the duel.</i>

854
00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:50.224
<i>Goodbye, Sarah.</i>

855
00:59:50.257 --> 00:59:52.059
<i>He's Robert Michaels now.</i>

856
00:59:56.964 --> 00:59:58.299
How have you been?

857
00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:00.301
Good.

858
01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:03.737
I started a new job recently.

859
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:05.106
Hey.

860
01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:06.740
Do you like it?

861
01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.343
I think I do.

862
01:00:10.111 --> 01:00:11.779
I don't know yet.

863
01:00:14.882 --> 01:00:16.851
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

864
01:00:17.351 --> 01:00:19.820
They postponed the duel,
as I'm sure you're aware.

865
01:00:19.854 --> 01:00:21.255
I am.

866
01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:23.324
She doesn't talk about
the duel all that much.

867
01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:27.795
I was surprised
you wanted to meet up.

868
01:00:29.797 --> 01:00:31.732
It felt like it was time.

869
01:00:34.135 --> 01:00:38.139
I want to apologize
for how things ended.

870
01:00:40.274 --> 01:00:42.843
I know I said some
really hurtful things there.

871
01:00:44.278 --> 01:00:45.946
I understand.

872
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.915
I took it as you trying
to push me away.

873
01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:52.052
I wanted to see you
and tell you I don't hate you.

874
01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:55.256
I wouldn't want to die
with you thinking I hated you.

875
01:00:58.025 --> 01:00:59.860
I appreciate you saying that.

876
01:01:02.129 --> 01:01:04.331
I'm going to try my best
to kill her, though.

877
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.302
And I won't be sorry for it.

878
01:01:09.303 --> 01:01:11.105
I need you to know that.

879
01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:14.308
I know.

880
01:01:17.244 --> 01:01:19.146
Should we order
something to eat?

881
01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:23.250
I think that would be nice.

882
01:01:32.193 --> 01:01:34.929
Hi, Trent.
The duel has been postponed.

883
01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:37.264
Can I keep training with you
for another month?

884
01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:41.068
Uh, well, I was wondering...

885
01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:44.482
you know how you were
talking about other forms

886
01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:47.107
of payment
that were mutually beneficial?

887
01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:49.310
Does that offer still stand?

888
01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:10.030

01:02:32.987 --> 01:02:37.191
Let's do it slower.
Five, six, seven, eight.

899
01:02:41.262 --> 01:02:42.963
Yes, better.

900
01:02:42.997 --> 01:02:44.241
Okay, let's do
it from the start.

901
01:02:44.265 --> 01:02:45.299
Thank you.

910
01:03:09.023 --> 01:03:11.492
Thank you again for
the hip-hop dance lessons.

911
01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:14.161
I've wanted to take classes
for three years now,

912
01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:16.297
but I've been too
nervous to start.

913
01:03:16.564 --> 01:03:19.333
I hope you continue dancing
even if I die in my duel.

914
01:03:20.301 --> 01:03:22.403
I've already signed up
for a beginner group class.

915
01:03:22.436 --> 01:03:24.138
Oh, that's good.

916
01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:26.373
I know this isn't ideal
for you to wait

917
01:03:26.407 --> 01:03:29.143
another month to duel
your double to the death,

918
01:03:29.176 --> 01:03:31.178
but look at it as
an opportunity.

919
01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:32.614
Try to see the positives.

920
01:03:32.647 --> 01:03:35.282
Another month means
another month of training.

921
01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.217
Do you see this dog here?

922
01:03:38.586 --> 01:03:40.287
The one here on the leash?

923
01:03:40.321 --> 01:03:42.222
Hm, his name is Connor.

924
01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:45.092
I named him after
my grandfather.

925
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:47.328
- He's your dog?
- He is.

926
01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:50.030
Aw. He looks friendly.

927
01:03:50.297 --> 01:03:52.132
Do you see that crossbow there?

928
01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:54.068
- That one?
- Yes.

929
01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.336
Grab it.

930
01:04:01.475 --> 01:04:03.177
Stand over there.

931
01:04:08.482 --> 01:04:10.250
Shoot my dog.

932
01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:15.557
Why?

933
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.992
Connor is very old
and very sick.

934
01:04:22.096 --> 01:04:23.464
I don't want to.

935
01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:27.067
It's okay. He's suffering.

936
01:04:27.535 --> 01:04:30.204
He's in an immense
amount of pain.

937
01:04:34.408 --> 01:04:36.443
You'll be putting him
out of his misery.

938
01:04:45.219 --> 01:04:46.554
Do it, Sarah.

939
01:04:48.122 --> 01:04:49.223
Please.

940
01:04:52.126 --> 01:04:53.394
He's in agony.

941
01:05:03.337 --> 01:05:04.539
I can't.

942
01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:08.208
I understand.

943
01:05:08.543 --> 01:05:11.245
I'm disappointed
in your killer instincts.

944
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:14.314
But...

945
01:05:14.348 --> 01:05:16.651
at least my dog is still alive.

946
01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:30.264
What the fuck, Sarah?!

947
01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:41.509
I'm sorry.

948
01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:18.613
Hi.

949
01:06:19.581 --> 01:06:20.615
Hi.

950
01:06:21.482 --> 01:06:23.116
Did you lose her?

951
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:27.722
Did you lose your twin?

952
01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:33.193
Yes. I can't find
my twin sister.

953
01:06:33.227 --> 01:06:35.295
She looks exactly like me
because we're twins,

954
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:36.430
just like you two.

955
01:06:36.463 --> 01:06:37.599
Have you seen her?

956
01:06:37.632 --> 01:06:39.266
She's over here.

957
01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.489
You don't have
to be scared anymore.

958
01:07:02.524 --> 01:07:04.424
We found your sister.

959
01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:07.629
When I and Abby
were really small,

960
01:07:07.662 --> 01:07:09.631
and we went to the store
with Mommy,

961
01:07:09.664 --> 01:07:13.200
and a man came up
and wanted to show Abby a toy.

962
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:17.237
I wanted to see the toy, too,
but the man said

963
01:07:17.271 --> 01:07:19.607
that if both of us
would be looking at the toy,

964
01:07:19.641 --> 01:07:22.577
Mommy could get scared
that where are we.

965
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:26.514
When Mommy came back,
I told her about the man,

966
01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:28.650
but Abby was gone.

967
01:07:28.683 --> 01:07:31.251
Abby didn't come for three days,

968
01:07:31.285 --> 01:07:33.721
and they found her in
a parking lot.

969
01:07:33.755 --> 01:07:36.658
I missed her terribly much,
and I cried a lot,

970
01:07:36.691 --> 01:07:39.293
but now,
we are all the time together,

971
01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:42.797
except when she goes to talk
to Miss Murphy every Sunday.

972
01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:46.500
But your sister is here,
and she loves you very much.

973
01:07:46.734 --> 01:07:48.402
Girls!

974
01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:50.638
Who are you? Let go of her.

975
01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:52.406
- Sorry.
- Mommy.

976
01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:55.409
She asked us to help
to find her twin sister.

977
01:07:55.442 --> 01:07:56.811
I think you should leave.

978
01:07:56.844 --> 01:07:58.378
Come on.

979
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.287
I know you're in there.

980
01:08:07.321 --> 01:08:10.290
You're going
to try and murder me.

981
01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:12.225
Look, I realize I shot at you.

982
01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:15.362
I've been training for a year
to kill you. It was instinctual.

983
01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:18.432
You surprised me.
What else would you expect?

984
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:20.300
We're supposed
to wait until the duel.

985
01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:22.368
I know. Open the door.

986
01:08:22.804 --> 01:08:25.272
I promise I won't
try to murder you.

987
01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:28.776
Okay.

988
01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:49.363
You almost got me,
even through the glass.

989
01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:52.800
I'm surprised I missed,
even through the glass.

990
01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:54.569
I'm agile.

991
01:08:55.636 --> 01:08:57.337
Can I ask you something?

992
01:08:59.774 --> 01:09:00.774
Sure.

993
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:04.545
When we first met,
all those months ago

994
01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:06.781
when I shook your hand,

995
01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:08.549
why didn't you
look me in the eye?

996
01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:12.754
I'm not sure.

997
01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:15.287
I think it was because
I knew what was going to happen.

998
01:09:15.322 --> 01:09:17.457
I mean, I knew I was going
to take over eventually,

999
01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:19.393
and I think I felt
a sense of guilt.

1000
01:09:19.594 --> 01:09:22.395
Taking over my life
was the plan, not stealing it.

1001
01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:24.899
I understand you feel that I
stole it, but it's my life, too.

1002
01:09:24.932 --> 01:09:26.567
But it was my life first.

1003
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.411
Yes, but that doesn't mean
my life matters any less.

1004
01:09:28.435 --> 01:09:30.437
- But your life is my life.
- It was your life,

1005
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.506
but I've moved past your life
and made it my own.

1006
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.551
Yes, but you knowingly stole
everything that made up my life

1007
01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:35.877
to make up yours.

1008
01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:39.617
I understand that you feel like
I went about it the wrong way.

1009
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.779
And to be honest, it's not what
I thought it would be anyway.

1010
01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.853
What do you mean?

1011
01:09:45.886 --> 01:09:49.724
Well, Peter and I argue about
the littlest things sometimes.

1012
01:09:49.756 --> 01:09:51.693
For example, last week,
I wanted to watch

1013
01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:54.327
a romantic comedy, and he wanted
to watch a dark comedy.

1014
01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:56.396
How can I be with someone
if we can't even agree

1015
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.365
on the genre of film
we should watch?

1016
01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:01.703
Or take our mother.
She acts like I owe her my life.

1017
01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:03.604
Phone calls, just to talk.

1018
01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:05.540
Texts asking me, "How are you?"

1019
01:10:05.573 --> 01:10:07.909
One before 9:00 A.M. saying,
"I love you very much."

1020
01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:10.554
And don't even get me started
on the amount of forwarded

1021
01:10:10.578 --> 01:10:12.680
social media posts
that are only moderately funny.

1022
01:10:12.714 --> 01:10:15.516
They already have a day for
mothers. Isn't that enough?

1023
01:10:16.718 --> 01:10:18.485
What are you trying to say?

1024
01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:21.556
I'm still not sure.

1025
01:10:22.523 --> 01:10:23.991
It's your life now.

1026
01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:26.594
I've moved on,
and I'm making a new one.

1027
01:10:29.964 --> 01:10:31.933
I'm still going
to kill you in the duel.

1028
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.569
But I'll make it quicker
and less painful

1029
01:10:34.602 --> 01:10:35.937
than I had originally planned.

1030
01:10:37.705 --> 01:10:39.540
I want to take you somewhere.

1031
01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:42.577
Where?

1032
01:10:51.819 --> 01:10:53.554
We're a little late.

1033
01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:57.625
I pushed him and he fell over.

1034
01:10:58.626 --> 01:11:01.028
He held up his hands
as a shield.

1035
01:11:01.996 --> 01:11:04.665
I will never forget
the screams he made.

1036
01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:06.033
Sorry.

1037
01:11:06.067 --> 01:11:08.669
That's all right.
Please come take a seat.

1038
01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:14.509
Carl had just started to tell us
about how he's been feeling.

1039
01:11:14.909 --> 01:11:16.644
Since his duel.

1040
01:11:18.679 --> 01:11:20.948
I can't remember
exactly where I was.

1041
01:11:21.849 --> 01:11:24.417
My memory isn't
what it used to be.

1042
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.355
In the moment, shooting
my double in the face

1043
01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:30.490
didn't make me feel bad.

1044
01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:33.661
I knew it was him or me.

1045
01:11:35.062 --> 01:11:36.898
Seeing his brain on that grass

1046
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:39.967
meant that I was going
to get to spend more time

1047
01:11:40.001 --> 01:11:42.435
with my children
and grandchildren.

1048
01:11:44.005 --> 01:11:46.040
It's been three years.

1049
01:11:47.508 --> 01:11:49.777
But I still wake up
from nightmares.

1050
01:11:50.077 --> 01:11:51.846
I cry in my sleep.

1051
01:11:52.513 --> 01:11:55.516
That's why my wife
sleeps on the couch.

1052
01:11:56.951 --> 01:11:59.452
She can't stand
to see me this way.

1053
01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:03.825
Sometimes I wonder,

1054
01:12:03.858 --> 01:12:07.962
what was the point
of fighting to live...

1055
01:12:07.995 --> 01:12:10.463
if this is the life I'm living?

1056
01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.071
Nice try.

1057
01:12:17.104 --> 01:12:19.607
Your mental tricks
aren't going to work on me.

1058
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.474
Nothing you do or say

1059
01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:23.744
or he does or says
or they do or say

1060
01:12:23.778 --> 01:12:26.047
is going to keep me
from surviving this whole mess.

1061
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.815
It's not like that.

1062
01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:30.084
Believe me when I say that
I'm going to do my very best

1063
01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:31.819
to kill you, too.

1064
01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:34.589
Just like I've also
definitely been training to do.

1065
01:12:34.622 --> 01:12:36.066
I just wanted you
to see people like us

1066
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.758
and hear their experiences.

1067
01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:40.628
Whichever one of us lives
is going to have to

1068
01:12:40.661 --> 01:12:43.531
live with this
for the rest of our life.

1069
01:12:43.564 --> 01:12:45.833
Your double's name
is Sarah's Double,

1070
01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:47.902
so I can only assume
your name is Sarah.

1071
01:12:48.603 --> 01:12:50.571
I'm Daryl, the group leader.

1072
01:12:50.605 --> 01:12:52.940
I'm responsible for starting
the check-in process,

1073
01:12:52.974 --> 01:12:55.610
and I ensure individuals
stay on topic.

1074
01:12:57.111 --> 01:13:00.114
I also introduce the arts and
crafts activity of the meeting.

1075
01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:02.049
Perhaps we should
move along to that.

1076
01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:12.960
Everyone raise
their non-dominant hand.

1077
01:13:16.898 --> 01:13:19.133
I want you to use this hand
to compose a letter

1078
01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.102
to your original,
or to your double,

1079
01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:23.571
depending on which one you are.

1080
01:13:23.771 --> 01:13:26.140
This is to help you connect
to a part of you that

1081
01:13:26.173 --> 01:13:28.209
could also feel like it belongs
to another person

1082
01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:29.944
at the same time.

1083
01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:33.114
You see where
I'm going with this?

1084
01:13:59.006 --> 01:14:02.977
"I had only two days
of imprintation with you.

1085
01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:06.647
"You let me discover
your lifeless body

1086
01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:09.717
in a bath of red,
lukewarm water."

1087
01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:14.922
"I didn't know how to be you.
I still don't."

1088
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:18.926
"I don't like the people
you forced me to live with.

1089
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.728
It makes me depressed."

1090
01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:24.031
"I want to kill myself, too."

1091
01:14:24.065 --> 01:14:28.035
"But we all know there cannot be
doubles of doubles."

1092
01:14:29.236 --> 01:14:31.839
"And even though
I didn't choose to be made,

1093
01:14:31.872 --> 01:14:35.810
I don't want to let anyone down
like you did."

1094
01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.816
"Best...

1095
01:14:41.849 --> 01:14:42.950
Larry."

1096
01:14:57.765 --> 01:15:00.701
"Most people would look down
upon what we had,

1097
01:15:00.735 --> 01:15:03.137
but it was better than anything
they will ever know.

1098
01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:06.741
We knew each other
intrinsically.

1099
01:15:08.142 --> 01:15:11.112
Better than if you knew
someone else an entire lifetime.

1100
01:15:12.747 --> 01:15:14.181
I still miss your touch.

1101
01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.918
"I'm sorry you had to die."

1102
01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:28.262
I would like to go next.

1103
01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:31.265
"Sarah..."

1104
01:15:33.034 --> 01:15:36.670
What you said in there,
I'm still at a loss.

1105
01:15:38.239 --> 01:15:40.941
I mean, the way you eloquently
accepted all the blame.

1106
01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:43.010
The way you effectively argued
that the real enemy

1107
01:15:43.044 --> 01:15:44.912
isn't each other.

1108
01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:46.890
It's a system that arbitrarily
decides only one of us can live

1109
01:15:46.914 --> 01:15:48.682
and that has us
fight to the death

1110
01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.985
as some sort of sick
spectator sport.

1111
01:15:51.318 --> 01:15:53.921
I'm sure you wrote something
similar in your letter.

1112
01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:55.756
Maybe you'll read it
for me someday.

1113
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:57.691
Yeah.

1114
01:15:58.059 --> 01:15:59.293
And you're right,

1115
01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:01.896
we actually have
a lot in common.

1116
01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:04.031
A lot, like being
good at swimming,

1117
01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:05.766
and we both have great breasts.

1118
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.034
Exactly.

1119
01:16:07.802 --> 01:16:09.236
Why should one of
us have to die?

1120
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:11.072
Why can't we be together?

1121
01:16:11.105 --> 01:16:13.150
I'm not saying we should fuck
like that one guy in there

1122
01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:16.777
obviously did with his double,
but why can't we both live?

1123
01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:20.047
Do you mean that?

1124
01:17:27.014 --> 01:17:28.849
I'm glad you know how to drive.

1125
01:17:28.883 --> 01:17:30.117
I never learned.

1126
01:17:30.151 --> 01:17:32.119
It seems easy enough, though.

1127
01:17:32.153 --> 01:17:34.121
You just press forward
on the right one,

1128
01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:36.023
and you stop by pulling it back.

1129
01:17:36.056 --> 01:17:38.259
No, you press the pedal
to the left of it to brake.

1130
01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:40.327
Huh. That makes sense.

1131
01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:46.934
And you change directions
with that round thing.

1132
01:17:46.967 --> 01:17:49.136
Turning it to the right
makes the car go right,

1133
01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:51.438
and turning it to the left
makes it go left.

1134
01:17:53.107 --> 01:17:56.076
See. Easy enough.

1135
01:18:15.129 --> 01:18:16.297
Comfortable clothing?

1136
01:18:18.332 --> 01:18:21.335
- Check.
- Backpacks?

1137
01:18:23.237 --> 01:18:25.039
Yours is smaller than
I was expecting.

1138
01:18:25.072 --> 01:18:27.007
I have everything I need.

1139
01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:29.276
Check.

1140
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.445
- No weapons?
- None.

1141
01:18:31.478 --> 01:18:33.180
I didn't bring any either.

1142
01:18:33.214 --> 01:18:34.525
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to make sure

1143
01:18:34.549 --> 01:18:36.183
you didn't bring any.

1144
01:18:36.217 --> 01:18:37.827
I don't want to do it here
on the side of the road.

1145
01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:39.353
Maybe when we take
our first break?

1146
01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:41.088
That's fine with me.

1147
01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:42.866
I'd like to check your pack,
too, for peace of mind.

1148
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.458
Of course.

1149
01:18:44.491 --> 01:18:46.460
Rations, check.

1150
01:18:46.493 --> 01:18:47.995
And water.

1151
01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:51.098
Yes, last on the list is water.

1152
01:18:51.131 --> 01:18:52.466
I have it. Check.

1153
01:18:52.499 --> 01:18:54.501
Let's drink some
before we begin walking.

1154
01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.974
I don't think I have
to remind you

1155
01:19:00.007 --> 01:19:01.509
of the importance of
staying hydrated.

1156
01:19:10.451 --> 01:19:13.020
Let's take another
bigger drink just to be safe.

1157
01:20:42.343 --> 01:20:44.411
Thank you.

1158
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.028
I wonder what will happen

1159
01:21:01.061 --> 01:21:02.472
when we both don't show up
for the duel.

1160
01:21:02.496 --> 01:21:04.198
One of the combatants in a duel

1161
01:21:04.231 --> 01:21:06.100
has failed to show up
before out of fear,

1162
01:21:06.133 --> 01:21:08.235
but they're almost always
later found and arrested.

1163
01:21:09.036 --> 01:21:11.214
Some try to get plastic surgery
in order to look different,

1164
01:21:11.238 --> 01:21:13.207
but I found out from Trent
that once we're a part

1165
01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.151
of the replacement program,
any attempts to contact

1166
01:21:15.175 --> 01:21:16.910
a plastic surgeon are flagged.

1167
01:21:16.944 --> 01:21:18.922
There's always the black-market,
though, but you are taking

1168
01:21:18.946 --> 01:21:22.015
a big risk getting
a black-market face transplant.

1169
01:21:22.049 --> 01:21:24.084
As far as I know,
there has never been a duel

1170
01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:26.420
where both the original
and the double are no-shows.

1171
01:21:28.155 --> 01:21:29.624
They'll send dogs after us.

1172
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:32.259
But we'll be across
the border by then.

1173
01:21:32.627 --> 01:21:35.062
Once we cross the border,
we'll be safe.

1174
01:21:36.664 --> 01:21:39.333
I'm incredibly thankful
you came and found me.

1175
01:21:39.366 --> 01:21:42.136
And to think, just a few
weeks ago, I wanted you dead.

1176
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:44.204
I'm so glad we're both
in such good shape.

1177
01:21:44.238 --> 01:21:45.649
We would have needed
many more rests already

1178
01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:47.642
had we not been training
this past year.

1179
01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.155
Yes.

1180
01:22:01.188 --> 01:22:02.489
I agree.

1181
01:23:47.494 --> 01:23:48.663
Sorry I'm late.

1182
01:23:48.696 --> 01:23:50.430
Which one are you?

1183
01:23:50.464 --> 01:23:52.767
The original, Sarah.

1184
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.669
Where have you been?

1185
01:23:55.402 --> 01:23:57.237
I had a little car trouble.

1186
01:23:57.639 --> 01:23:59.507
What kind of car trouble?

1187
01:24:00.374 --> 01:24:02.786
I accidentally mistook the wheel
that turns the car right or left

1188
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:04.478
for the pedal
that stops the car.

1189
01:24:04.512 --> 01:24:06.446
I'm fine. Should we begin?

1190
01:24:07.247 --> 01:24:08.448
We can't start yet.

1191
01:24:08.482 --> 01:24:09.784
Why not?

1192
01:24:09.817 --> 01:24:11.553
Because your double isn't here.

1193
01:24:11.586 --> 01:24:12.820
Really?

1194
01:24:12.854 --> 01:24:14.522
Actually, that sounds
just like her.

1195
01:24:14.556 --> 01:24:16.356
She didn't take this duel
very seriously.

1196
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.801
I bet she hasn't even
been training for it.

1197
01:24:17.825 --> 01:24:19.661
You should probably
let your superiors know.

1198
01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:21.361
She's likely trying to flee.

1199
01:24:25.365 --> 01:24:26.365
Yes?

1200
01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:30.404
I'm afraid not, ma'am.
Just the original.

1201
01:24:32.306 --> 01:24:35.309
I have reason to believe
this is a code negative one.

1202
01:25:34.368 --> 01:25:37.739
And do you, sir, swear that,
to the best of your knowledge,

1203
01:25:37.772 --> 01:25:41.475
having known her
emotionally and intimately,

1204
01:25:41.509 --> 01:25:43.544
that this is the original Sarah?

1205
01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.447
I do.

1206
01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:51.586
And do you swear
beyond the shadow of any

1207
01:25:51.619 --> 01:25:54.589
reasonable doubt
that the person before us today

1208
01:25:54.622 --> 01:25:57.659
is the daughter that gestated
inside you for nine months

1209
01:25:57.692 --> 01:26:01.696
and you raised for 18 years,
your own flesh and blood?

1210
01:26:01.929 --> 01:26:04.364
This is my Sarah, Your Honor.

1211
01:26:04.398 --> 01:26:07.735
And, finally,
do you solemnly swear

1212
01:26:07.769 --> 01:26:10.437
that you are
who you say you are?

1213
01:26:12.607 --> 01:26:13.841
I'm Sarah.

1214
01:26:18.913 --> 01:26:21.716
I think I have a new wrinkle
and two new sunspots.

1215
01:26:21.749 --> 01:26:22.950
I'm sure you don't.

1216
01:26:22.984 --> 01:26:24.819
I can count, Peter.

1217
01:26:24.852 --> 01:26:27.889
There's exactly one new wrinkle
on my face and two new sunspots.

1218
01:26:33.961 --> 01:26:36.430
Well, you have to start
using sunscreen.

1219
01:26:36.463 --> 01:26:38.533
And not just when
you're going to the beach

1220
01:26:38.566 --> 01:26:39.843
or when you're
walking around a theme park.

1221
01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:41.401
It has to be daily.

1222
01:26:41.435 --> 01:26:43.671
Your skin is more
sensitive than others'.

1223
01:26:45.472 --> 01:26:47.942
And you have to start
taking better care of yourself.

1224
01:26:47.975 --> 01:26:50.645
I don't mean to sound
insensitive, but...

1225
01:26:50.678 --> 01:26:52.947
it's only going to get
a lot harder from here.

1226
01:26:53.915 --> 01:26:55.950
As long as men take
moderate care of themselves,

1227
01:26:55.983 --> 01:26:57.752
they tend to peak later in life.

1228
01:26:57.785 --> 01:26:59.854
Women, on the other hand,
have a much smaller window

1229
01:26:59.887 --> 01:27:02.857
in which they're deemed to be
at their peak attractiveness.

1230
01:27:03.858 --> 01:27:05.626
And don't worry, sweetheart,

1231
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.762
I'm gonna love you
no matter how you look,

1232
01:27:07.795 --> 01:27:09.564
even with that genetic mutation

1233
01:27:09.597 --> 01:27:11.766
that causes premature
graying and hair loss.

1234
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.969
Should I buy more hair dye
for you while I'm out?

1235
01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:19.640
No, I'll get some
on my way home from work.

1236
01:27:23.678 --> 01:27:25.747
Remember to keep making
at least the minimum payment

1237
01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.948
on the replacement loan.

1238
01:27:26.981 --> 01:27:28.583
I know, Peter.

1239
01:27:32.754 --> 01:27:34.522
Where should we go
for dinner tonight?

1240
01:27:35.723 --> 01:27:37.457
How about Mexican food?

1241
01:27:39.794 --> 01:27:41.863
I don't like Mexican food.

1242
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:56.944
Aren't you going to answer that?

1243
01:27:58.746 --> 01:28:00.681
She's my mom, not yours.

1244
01:28:02.049 --> 01:28:03.818
<i>Hi, Sarah.</i>

1245
01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:06.521
<i>This is your mother
just calling to talk.</i>

1246
01:28:06.554 --> 01:28:08.689
<i>I must have just missed you.</i>

1247
01:28:09.456 --> 01:28:12.693
<i>You're probably just walking
out the door of your house...</i>

1248
01:28:14.494 --> 01:28:15.997
<i>getting into your car,</i>

1249
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:18.800
<i>ready to start another
day at your job,</i>

1250
01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:20.535
<i>which you love.</i>

1251
01:28:21.903 --> 01:28:24.504
<i>I just wanted you to know,
I went ahead and ordered</i>

1252
01:28:24.539 --> 01:28:26.974
<i>another box of contacts
from the optometrist.</i>

1253
01:28:27.875 --> 01:28:30.511
<i>The colored ones
aren't always in stock,</i>

1254
01:28:30.545 --> 01:28:32.713
<i>so it's best to
order ahead of time.</i>

1255
01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:36.651
<i>I know you're still getting
settled back into your life,</i>

1256
01:28:36.684 --> 01:28:39.452
<i>so I figured something
as simple as new contacts</i>

1257
01:28:39.486 --> 01:28:41.656
<i>might slip through the cracks.</i>

1258
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:43.724
<i>I'll call you when
you get off work</i>

1259
01:28:43.758 --> 01:28:46.727
<i>so we can plan a brunch
for this weekend.</i>

1260
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:48.663
<i>I love you.</i>
