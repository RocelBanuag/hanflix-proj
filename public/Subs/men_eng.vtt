-Hello!
-Hello!

20
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.633
Mrs. Marlowe, yes?

21
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.602
Harper, yes.

22
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:55.970
Wonderful. Geoffrey.

23
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.270
Hi.

24
00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.806
-Do come in.
-Thank you.

25
00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.309
Was it a hellish drive?

26
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.712
-No, no, no. Not at all.
-Oh, good.

27
00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:06.714
The M4 can be beastly.

28
00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:09.016
"M4, dreadful chore."

29
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.752
That's what we used to say.

30
00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:14.321
Well, it's a beautiful house.

31
00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.390
Yes, nearly 500 years old
in parts. Hmm?

32
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.594
What a thought, eh?

33
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:22.362
Shakespeare.

34
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:24.832
Or pre.

35
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.902
Uh, look, you must have bags.

36
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.470
Sorry?

37
00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.507
Oh, you must have bags.
Boot of the car?

38
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.574
Why don't I bring them in?

39
00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:34.575
I can help.

40
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.878
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, absolutely not. No.

41
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.679
You, uh, make yourself
comfortable.

42
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:41.448
The kettle's boiled.
Kitchen just through there.

43
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.350
Uh, tea in the cupboard,
milk in the fridge.

44
00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.986
Just where you'd expect
to find them.

45
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:46.721
Great.

46
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:47.755
Won't be a jiffy.

47
00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.470
Shit.

48
00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:39.372
Can I help?

49
00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:42.109
Erm, no, no.
No, no. No problem.

50
00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:55.923
Gosh, broken a sweat.

51
00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:58.593
Started to wish
I'd let you help.

52
00:05:58.626 --> 00:05:59.894
Still, I expect
you need it all.

53
00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:01.394
It's two weeks you've got
the place, isn't it?

54
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:02.462
Yeah. That's right, yeah.

55
00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.898
Oh, you found the tea.
Jolly good.

56
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.068
Apple from the garden?

57
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.503
Yeah, it was delicious.

58
00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:11.906
Scrumping, eh? No, no, no, no.

59
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.742
Mustn't do that.
Forbidden fruit.

60
00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.143
Oh. Uh...

61
00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:17.511
God, sorry, I... I...

62
00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.814
I'm joking.

63
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:20.982
Oh.

64
00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:24.151
Have as many as you like.
Make chutney.

65
00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:25.887
They only fall to the ground
and spoil.

66
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.855
Next thing you know,
the place is full of wasps.

67
00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:31.424
-Shall I show you round?
-Yeah.

68
00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:36.130
Uh, and let's start
with the ground floor.

69
00:06:37.932 --> 00:06:40.433
Drawing room.

70
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:43.971
Oh, now, not the best
reception on the telly.

71
00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:46.607
Little bit patchy
when it's raining.

72
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:48.109
Don't know why.

73
00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.177
Fireplace is good to go.

74
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.545
Oh, and if you
run out of wood,

75
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.980
there's stacks more
in the shed.

76
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.951
Moving in to the piano room.

77
00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:01.122
Do you play the piano?

78
00:07:02.023 --> 00:07:03.490
Uh, no.

79
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.660
Oh. Me neither.

80
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:10.131
Now let me show you
the dining room.

81
00:07:10.164 --> 00:07:12.733
Good for a slap-up
Sunday roast.

82
00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:15.236
Uh, the cloak room. Coats,

83
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.939
brollies, wellies,
blah, blah, blah.

84
00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:20.675
But, obviously, try not
to walk mud through the house.

85
00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:23.110
Upstairs.

86
00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:25.513
Up the wibbly-wobbly way.

87
00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.648
Little uneven
but hold your nerve.

88
00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:34.088
Clean towels, plenty of soap.

89
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:38.559
And, uh, good big tub
for soaking after a long walk.

90
00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.928
Ah, only thing...
Sorry, have to say it.

91
00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:43.030
Uh, ladies,
do watch what you flush.

92
00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:45.933
Right. Yeah.

93
00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:48.002
Septic tank, you see.
Can't cope.

94
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.074
Well, let's say no more.

95
00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:59.013
Finally, ta-da.
The master bedroom.

96
00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.715
Wow.

97
00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.550
Yeah, wonderful view,
isn't it?

98
00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:07.088
See the church spire
over the trees?

99
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:10.691
That's the village.
A stone's throw.

100
00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:12.860
Jolly nice pub
if you're interested.

101
00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:13.928
10-minute walk there,

102
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.796
30-minute walk back.

103
00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:17.732
Mm.

104
00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:21.235
Clean sheets and so forth.

105
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:24.538
And, uh, will it just
be you staying or...

106
00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:25.840
Yeah, it's just me.

107
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:28.275
Where's hubby?

108
00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:31.612
Excuse me?

109
00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:32.746
"Mrs. Marlowe," no?

110
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.717
Yeah, uh, no.

111
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.753
No, it isn't.
I haven't changed it yet,

112
00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:39.787
the "Mrs."

113
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.621
Or the surname.

114
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.092
Oh. Oh.

115
00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.698
Well done, Geoffrey.

116
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.933
Oh, no. Please, it's fine.

117
00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:56.037
Wi-Fi password,
and all that mumbo jumbo

118
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.639
is in the welcome pack
on the piano.

119
00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.875
Now, key. Key to the castle.

120
00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:02.943
Just the one.

121
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:04.812
Don't worry if you lose it.
To be honest,

122
00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:05.980
you don't need to lock
your doors 'round here.

123
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.681
Well, thanks again.

124
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.817
The... The place is lovely.

125
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.985
It's exactly what I hoped for.

126
00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:12.653
Ah. Well,
I'll leave you to it.

127
00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.359
Oh, if you need me,
you've got my number.

128
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.628
And I live just down the lane.

129
00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:23.164
The cottage with
a "beware of the dog" sign.

130
00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:24.632
And even though
the old girl's been dead

131
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:25.534
these past five years,

132
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.768
and never said boo
to a goose.

133
00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:29.203
Well, thanks again.

134
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.274
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

135
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.950
I think I might have
splashed out

136
00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:44.919
just a little bit too much.

137
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.787
<i>No, it's gorgeous.</i>

138
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:51.358
Yes, yes, yes. It is.
It is the dream country house.

139
00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:54.061
<i>Can you give me the tour?</i>
<i>I want to see all of it.</i>

140
00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:55.930
Uh, yeah, can I do it later?

141
00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:58.933
I just finished the tour
with the owner, Geoffrey.

142
00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.968
He was quite a character.

143
00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:02.169
<i>Go on.</i>

144
00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:05.239
He was a very,
very, specific type.

145
00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:09.176
Very, very country.

146
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.878
<i>And will you be joining him</i>

147
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.146
<i>grouse shooting tomorrow?</i>

148
00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.247
That's perfect.

149
00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:18.152
He asked about James,
actually.

150
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:20.921
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>he asked about James? How?</i>

151
00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:24.125
I booked it
under Mrs. Marlowe.

152
00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:27.128
Just... strange
that I did that.

153
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.395
Automatic, I guess.

154
00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.397
<i>So, what did you tell him?</i>

155
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:31.899
I didn't tell him anything.

156
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:35.970
I implied I was divorced.

157
00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:38.172
<i>Yeah.</i>

158
00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:42.243
<i>-Harper...</i>
-Stop, I know
what you're gonna say.

159
00:10:43.344 --> 00:10:45.679
I mean, I don't know, but...

160
00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:47.882
Look, this kind of thing

161
00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.151
is gonna happen
again and again.

162
00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:52.419
In one way, it's gonna
happen my whole life, so,

163
00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:55.322
I'm just gonna
have to get used to it.

164
00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:57.224
<i>Okay.</i>

165
00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:00.427
<i>But you didn't know</i>
<i>what I was gonna say.</i>

166
00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:02.463
<i>I was gonna say,</i>

167
00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:04.031
<i>did you know that elephants</i>

168
00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:05.733
<i>are the only animal</i>
<i>that can't jump?</i>

169
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:10.871
<i>Just an interesting fact</i>
<i>that I need to share with you.</i>

170
00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:12.473
That is very interesting.

171
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:14.441
<i>Yeah, and it's...</i>

172
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.116
<i>...elephant dressage events</i>
<i>never really took off.</i>

173
00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.820
<i>Sorry. Lame.</i>

174
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:29.757
No, no. No. No, no, sorry,
just the signal cut out.

175
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.159
<i>Fucking typical.</i>
<i>I was being hilarious.</i>

176
00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:35.829
-Um...
<i>-So, yeah, I'll...</i>

177
00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:37.298
<i>-I'll see you later.</i>
-Yeah, yeah. You bet.

178
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:38.832
-All right. Love you.
<i>-Bye, love you.</i>

179
00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.034
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

180
00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:09.296
<i>You're not divorcing me.</i>

181
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.834
You're divorcing how...

182
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.836
how I've been for...
for the past year.

183
00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:17.471
I get that, but once...
once I've...

184
00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:18.839
James.

185
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.047
We... We made
promises, Harper.

186
00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:28.382
In a church.

187
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.085
What promises did we make?

188
00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:32.786
If I can know
why you married me,

189
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.822
then I can subtract
what's different about me now.

190
00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:36.056
-James.
-Yes?

191
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.124
Please.

192
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.998
I'll kill myself.

193
00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:50.871
No, you can't...

194
00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:52.339
You can't say
something like that.

195
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.544
-You can't say that to me!
-I'm saying it.

196
00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:58.946
I say it

197
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.181
because you will have
to live with it.

198
00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:03.384
On your conscience.

199
00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:05.754
No.

200
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.056
No, James! Just, please...

201
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.893
Stop
saying please, Harper!

202
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.129
Stop pleading! I am pleading!

203
00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.865
I am!

204
00:13:19.534 --> 00:13:22.136
Now, I am sorry you will have
to live with my death

205
00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:24.104
on your conscience,
but it's the truth.

206
00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.974
You can't give this to me.

207
00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:28.075
It'll be as if
you'd killed me yourself.

208
00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:30.144
You can't say this.
You can't do that. No, James.

209
00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:31.879
No, it'll be
as if you killed yourself,

210
00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:34.315
and would be
fucking unbearable.

211
00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:36.183
That is the last thing
I would ever, ever want.

212
00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:37.351
This isn't... It's not.

213
00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.554
It's not the last thing
because you wanna divorce me.

214
00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:41.388
That's so...

215
00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:43.257
-That's so fucking crazy!
-You wanna divorce me

216
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.491
more than you wanna
keep me alive!

217
00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:45.993
Can't you hear
what you're saying?

218
00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:47.328
How is my life
worth so little to you?

219
00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:49.463
Because I have a life, too!

220
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.498
I have a fucking life!

221
00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:53.635
You are threatening me.

222
00:13:53.668 --> 00:13:54.902
-I'm not threatening you.
-You are...

223
00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.136
It's not a threat.
It's a warning.

224
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.104
You're fucking threatening me,

225
00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:58.272
-and it's fucking horrible.
-It's a fact.

226
00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.240
It tears me apart!

227
00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:02.209
But when you threaten me
into not divorcing you,

228
00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:05.412
that is exactly why
we have to get divorced.

229
00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:09.450
And I am going to divorce you,
okay? I am. I am.

230
00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:12.953
Because I can't live like...

231
00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.121
I can't live...

232
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:55.670
Ahh!

233
00:19:15.823 --> 00:19:17.224

Fuck.

Fuck.

241
00:31:24.985 --> 00:31:26.286
Hey.

242
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.187
Yeah, good.

243
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:29.456
Um, I'm just going
through the figures

244
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.924
you just sent over.

245
00:31:31.659 --> 00:31:32.727
The revisions, yeah.

246
00:31:32.761 --> 00:31:34.596
I just wanted to double-check
a couple of things.

247
00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:43.237
Yeah, uh, but, sorry,
we can't offer them that deal

248
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.640
if the figures are correct.
Our margins disappear.

249
00:31:48.475 --> 00:31:49.476
Margins.

250
00:31:50.244 --> 00:31:52.112
Yeah. Uh-huh.

251
00:32:06.193 --> 00:32:08.630
Okay. Call the suppliers
and check.

252
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.431
Bye.

253
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.245
- Hey!
<i>- Hi.</i>

254
00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:27.047
<i>I'm ready for that tour</i>
<i>your promised me.</i>

255
00:32:27.414 --> 00:32:28.415
Now?

256
00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:30.518
<i>Yeah, it's perfect timing.</i>

257
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:32.986
-Who for?
<i>-Come on, Harper!</i>

258
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.388
Okay. Okay.

259
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:37.991
This place is pretty cool.

260
00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:40.994
So, here's the garden.

261
00:32:41.395 --> 00:32:42.664
<i>Oh!</i>

262
00:32:42.697 --> 00:32:44.732
Conservatory.

263
00:32:45.365 --> 00:32:46.500
<i>Love it!</i>

264
00:32:46.534 --> 00:32:48.302
And...

265
00:32:50.103 --> 00:32:51.639
the kitchen.

266
00:32:51.673 --> 00:32:53.541
<i>Red walls, that's bold.</i>

267
00:32:53.575 --> 00:32:56.109
-Very.
<i>-Yeah, it works.</i>

268
00:32:56.143 --> 00:32:58.278
<i>Shaker, ugh!</i>

269
00:32:58.312 --> 00:32:59.346
<i>AGA!</i>

270
00:32:59.379 --> 00:33:01.315
I know.

271
00:33:01.348 --> 00:33:04.586
And moving ever so gently

272
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.087
into the east wing.

273
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.523
You'll notice
the beautiful patina

274
00:33:08.556 --> 00:33:10.057
on the flagstone floor

275
00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.125
<i>-Mm.</i>
-Mm!

276
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:14.796
-Low oak beams.
<i>-Of course.</i>

277
00:33:14.829 --> 00:33:19.333
And here we have a generously
proportioned living room.

278
00:33:19.366 --> 00:33:22.035
Open wood fire.

279
00:33:22.069 --> 00:33:24.338
-Comfortable sofas.
<i>-Uh!</i>

280
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:25.807
And a baby grand.

281
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.374
<i>Wow!</i>

282
00:33:27.407 --> 00:33:30.377
<i>-Do you play piano?</i>
-I do, actually.

283
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.479
<i>Love that wallpaper.</i>

284
00:33:32.514 --> 00:33:34.281
<i>-Those windows!</i>
-Ugh, sunlit aspect.

285
00:33:34.314 --> 00:33:36.250
And look,
check out the view of the...

286
00:33:40.387 --> 00:33:42.189
I'll call you back.

287
00:33:42.222 --> 00:33:43.323
<i>What...</i>

288
00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:59.273
<i>999,</i>

289
00:33:59.306 --> 00:34:00.575
<i>which service do you require?</i>

290
00:34:00.608 --> 00:34:01.676
Police.

291
00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:03.310
<i>Please explain the reason</i>
<i>for calling.</i>

292
00:34:03.343 --> 00:34:06.246
There's an intruder
in my garden. Um, a man.

293
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.682
He isn't wearing any clothes,

294
00:34:07.715 --> 00:34:09.717
and I think
he might be stalking me.

295
00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:11.753
<i>Can you give me your address?</i>

296
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:15.757
It's a village. Cotson.

297
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.458
Uh, C-O-T-S-O...

298
00:34:19.293 --> 00:34:20.594
<i>Herefordshire?</i>

299
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.666
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay.</i>

300
00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.400
<i>Does the house have</i>
<i>any distinguishing features?</i>

301
00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:30.203
Features? Um...

302
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.775
Uh, my, uh... My car.

303
00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:35.208
My car's parked outside.

304
00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:40.280
It's a blue Ford Fiesta.
Registration CK61 LZF.

305
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.722
<i>Explain what's happening,</i>
<i>please.</i>

306
00:34:52.893 --> 00:34:54.829
<i>Can you explain</i>
<i>what's happening, please?</i>

307
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:06.340
<i>A police car</i>
<i>has been dispatched.</i>

308
00:35:06.373 --> 00:35:07.609
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

309
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:08.776
I am staying on the line.

310
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.477
<i>Are you alone in the house?</i>

311
00:35:13.781 --> 00:35:16.216
-He's trying to get in.
<i>-Police are on their way.</i>

312
00:35:16.249 --> 00:35:18.786
<i>There's a car in your area.</i>
<i>It will be with you soon.</i>

313
00:35:46.614 --> 00:35:47.849
I'm scaring you?

314
00:35:49.249 --> 00:35:50.652
Yeah, you are.

315
00:35:52.486 --> 00:35:53.655
You're scaring me.

316
00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:56.456
How do you not
understand that?

317
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.826
How do you make yourself
into the fucking victim?

318
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.360
-You scare me.
-James.

319
00:36:00.394 --> 00:36:02.429
Look,
I don't want either of us

320
00:36:02.462 --> 00:36:03.898
to be scared of the other.

321
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:06.233
Well, what... What, you're
saying I do want that?

322
00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:07.467
No, I'm not saying that.

323
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.403
No, no. What does this say?

324
00:36:12.507 --> 00:36:14.742
It says,
"He's really scaring me."

325
00:36:18.245 --> 00:36:19.781
What've you said
to that bitch, Riley?

326
00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:20.848
Nothing.

327
00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:22.984
-Unlock it.
-No.

328
00:36:23.017 --> 00:36:24.351
-Unlock it.
-No.

329
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.888
What are you trying
to hide from me?

330
00:36:29.256 --> 00:36:30.323
It's my phone.

331
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:49.443
Okay, let's get him up.

332
00:36:50.678 --> 00:36:51.879
Come on then, my friend.

333
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.016
So you don't know who he is?

334
00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:58.786
Well, he wasn't carrying
any ID, that's for sure.

335
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.621
Looks like
he's been sleeping rough.

336
00:37:01.989 --> 00:37:03.624
I saw him yesterday.

337
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.562
Well...

338
00:37:07.595 --> 00:37:08.763
I know, I... I think...

339
00:37:08.796 --> 00:37:10.631
I think he followed me
out of the woods.

340
00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:12.533
Which woods?

341
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:13.835
Oh, God,
I don't know the area.

342
00:37:13.868 --> 00:37:14.836
I was on a walk.

343
00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:17.538
Erm, it was the forest
just over the fields.

344
00:37:17.572 --> 00:37:20.641
Mm, Cotson Woods,
the old railway line.

345
00:37:20.675 --> 00:37:22.944
Yeah, that's probably
where he was sleeping.

346
00:37:27.782 --> 00:37:29.517
Look, it must've been
very frightening.

347
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.052
I do understand.

348
00:37:31.085 --> 00:37:32.452
But honestly,

349
00:37:33.353 --> 00:37:34.956
I think he's harmless.

350
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:36.891
He didn't resist at all.

351
00:37:36.924 --> 00:37:38.860
Seemed a bit confused,
bit of a nut, you know.

352
00:37:38.893 --> 00:37:40.828
Right, yeah.

353
00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:42.429
He stinks to high heaven,
though.

354
00:37:42.462 --> 00:37:44.297
That man is definitely
in need of a wash.

355
00:37:44.331 --> 00:37:46.399
I'm not looking forward
to driving him to the station.

356
00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:48.836
Well, I'm just glad
you were nearby.

357
00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:51.038
Me, too.

358
00:37:51.072 --> 00:37:52.840
Oh, no.
They came really quickly.

359
00:37:52.874 --> 00:37:54.307
Which is bloody lucky

360
00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:55.643
'cause I bet
their response time

361
00:37:55.676 --> 00:37:57.477
can be really slow out here.

362
00:38:00.114 --> 00:38:01.448
<i>Will you</i>
<i>please let me come up?</i>

363
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:02.482
No.

364
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:04.886
<i>Harper, for fuck's sake.</i>

365
00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:07.522
Oh, for fuck's sake yourself.

366
00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:10.390
I didn't come here
to be afraid, Riley.

367
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.726
<i>What are you trying to prove?</i>

368
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.928
<i>This isn't about being weak.</i>

369
00:38:13.961 --> 00:38:15.897
Yeah, it isn't.

370
00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:19.734
It was just some weirdo, okay?

371
00:38:19.767 --> 00:38:21.068
And the police said
he wasn't dangerous,

372
00:38:21.102 --> 00:38:23.504
and they've got him
now anyway, so...

373
00:38:23.538 --> 00:38:24.605
End of story.

374
00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:28.643
Look, it's a quiet,
pretty village

375
00:38:28.676 --> 00:38:31.879
in beautiful countryside.

376
00:38:31.913 --> 00:38:33.080
I'm gonna do a bit more work,

377
00:38:33.114 --> 00:38:35.016
and then I'm gonna have
a wander around.

378
00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:36.851
There's an old church nearby,

379
00:38:36.884 --> 00:38:38.586
and, apparently,
the pub's nice, so...

380
00:38:44.792 --> 00:38:46.093
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay.

381
00:40:59.694 --> 00:41:00.962
What was that, James?

382
00:41:02.897 --> 00:41:04.532
Your plan to win me back?

383
00:41:06.667 --> 00:41:07.768
Harper...

384
00:41:07.802 --> 00:41:09.136
Get out.

385
00:41:10.304 --> 00:41:11.539
Get out.

386
00:41:11.572 --> 00:41:13.641
I'm... I'm sorry, please.

387
00:41:15.042 --> 00:41:17.511
Get out! Get out!

388
00:41:17.545 --> 00:41:19.280
-Harper, I...
-Get out!

389
00:41:19.313 --> 00:41:21.115
Get out!

390
00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:22.883
I'm sorry!

391
00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:25.720
No! You want
to fucking apologize?

392
00:41:25.753 --> 00:41:27.688
After threatening
to kill yourself?

393
00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:29.657
Don't bother,
I don't give a fuck!

394
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.558
It'll make no difference,

395
00:41:30.591 --> 00:41:32.626
because whatever you say,
whatever you do,

396
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.795
you will never,
ever see me again.

397
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:37.231
Now get the fuck out!

398
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.154
Hello.

399
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:10.691
Who are you?

400
00:43:11.392 --> 00:43:12.626
Uh...

401
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.694
I'm Harper.

402
00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:19.900
Wanna play a game?

403
00:43:23.003 --> 00:43:24.004
Hide and seek?

404
00:43:25.306 --> 00:43:27.007
You hide. I'll seek.

405
00:43:29.176 --> 00:43:30.878
I... I... I don't think I can.

406
00:43:32.847 --> 00:43:33.848
You can't hide?

407
00:43:35.416 --> 00:43:36.917
Go on.

408
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:38.319
I bet you're good at it.

409
00:43:38.352 --> 00:43:39.353
And I'm good at seeking.

410
00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:41.388
I'm just not in the mood
to play a game right now.

411
00:43:42.189 --> 00:43:43.190
Sorry.

412
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:46.660
Samuel. Go home.

413
00:43:46.694 --> 00:43:48.229
Leave the lady alone.

414
00:43:48.262 --> 00:43:50.197
No. I want to play a game
with her.

415
00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:51.699
She's told you
perfectly clearly

416
00:43:51.732 --> 00:43:53.901
she doesn't feel like it.

417
00:43:53.934 --> 00:43:55.269
Perhaps she will later,
but not right now.

418
00:43:56.737 --> 00:43:57.938
Why don't you fuck off?

419
00:43:59.773 --> 00:44:00.841
You first.

420
00:44:13.754 --> 00:44:14.855
Stupid bitch.

421
00:44:18.225 --> 00:44:19.326
I do apologize.

422
00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:22.930
Samuel is
a deeply troubled boy.

423
00:44:22.963 --> 00:44:23.998
I live in London,

424
00:44:24.031 --> 00:44:25.766
I'm used to kids
swearing at me.

425
00:44:27.468 --> 00:44:30.237
Not so used to them swearing
at vicars, but...

426
00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:33.140
Yes, but, um...

427
00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:36.076
Just one thing. Do you mind?

428
00:44:36.777 --> 00:44:37.778
No.

429
00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:39.947
You're in pain, yes?

430
00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:41.949
Sorry?

431
00:44:41.982 --> 00:44:43.384
I noticed you just now,
in the church,

432
00:44:43.417 --> 00:44:44.785
sitting in the pews.

433
00:44:46.287 --> 00:44:48.255
And...

434
00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:49.723
At first,
I thought you were praying,

435
00:44:49.757 --> 00:44:51.325
but then I realized
you weren't praying.

436
00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.261
You're tormented.

437
00:44:56.864 --> 00:44:59.333
I didn't approach,
but of course, I should have.

438
00:44:59.366 --> 00:45:00.401
So...

439
00:45:01.268 --> 00:45:02.269
I am now.

440
00:45:04.972 --> 00:45:06.240
Do you think I could help?

441
00:45:10.044 --> 00:45:11.712
I don't know if I'm...

442
00:45:13.814 --> 00:45:16.183
tormented, exactly, but...

443
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:17.985
But?

444
00:45:18.018 --> 00:45:19.420
It feels more like...

445
00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:23.891
Haunted?

446
00:45:25.492 --> 00:45:26.493
Yeah.

447
00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:33.500
Let's sit a while.

448
00:45:38.573 --> 00:45:40.741
I'd had a row with my husband.

449
00:45:42.009 --> 00:45:44.144
We were separating, and...

450
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.481
But this was...

451
00:45:49.116 --> 00:45:50.851
This was by far the worst.

452
00:45:56.824 --> 00:45:58.259
And something happened.

453
00:46:00.327 --> 00:46:01.529
He hit me.

454
00:46:07.468 --> 00:46:10.371
He'd never done that before.

455
00:46:10.404 --> 00:46:14.441
I... I... I screamed at him,
I was so angry.

456
00:46:15.577 --> 00:46:17.244
I made him leave,
threw him out,

457
00:46:17.278 --> 00:46:19.346
locked the door.
Wouldn't let him back in.

458
00:46:22.182 --> 00:46:23.450
Then, apparently,
what happened next

459
00:46:23.484 --> 00:46:27.054
was he pushed his away
into the flat upstairs,

460
00:46:27.087 --> 00:46:29.990
went to their balcony,
tried to climb down to ours,

461
00:46:30.024 --> 00:46:31.125
but he...

462
00:46:32.393 --> 00:46:35.129
he slipped. Or...

463
00:46:41.502 --> 00:46:43.971
Or let himself go.

464
00:46:48.175 --> 00:46:49.577
I honestly don't know.

465
00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:55.949
As he fell past,

466
00:46:55.983 --> 00:46:57.818
I was looking out.

467
00:46:59.253 --> 00:47:00.555
And he was looking in.

468
00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.394
And it felt like
we could see each other.

469
00:47:10.397 --> 00:47:11.465
Well...

470
00:47:14.001 --> 00:47:15.903
Well, I'm not even sure
if that's possible.

471
00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:20.341
Could he see me?

472
00:47:21.576 --> 00:47:22.644
As he fell?

473
00:47:22.677 --> 00:47:24.546
It happened so quickly,

474
00:47:24.579 --> 00:47:26.614
but I think he did.

475
00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:30.451
And that's what haunts me.

476
00:47:35.189 --> 00:47:36.223
I see.

477
00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.529
If I may...

478
00:47:44.164 --> 00:47:45.332
I think

479
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.035
you need to be understood.

480
00:47:49.269 --> 00:47:50.938
And I do understand.

481
00:47:53.407 --> 00:47:55.943
I can fully imagine
it must be dreadful for you.

482
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.281
And, inevitably,

483
00:48:01.315 --> 00:48:03.283
you also feel
an awful sense of...

484
00:48:04.686 --> 00:48:06.253
of guilt.

485
00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:09.256
And that haunts you, too.

486
00:48:12.326 --> 00:48:15.929
The seared snapshot image.

487
00:48:17.364 --> 00:48:19.701
Why, yes, you carry it. You...

488
00:48:19.734 --> 00:48:22.236
You see it when you close
your eyes, but...

489
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.406
Also, you ask
yourself repeatedly,

490
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.242
"What if?"

491
00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:30.978
"If only."

492
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.948
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

493
00:48:50.698 --> 00:48:52.266
It's the screaming.

494
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.340
I think he wasn't screaming.

495
00:49:01.408 --> 00:49:03.043
No, yours.

496
00:49:10.117 --> 00:49:12.219
You must wonder
why you drove him to it?

497
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:18.392
What?
I didn't drive him to it.

498
00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:23.731
Well,

499
00:49:26.768 --> 00:49:28.101
after he struck you,

500
00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:30.404
did you give him a chance
to apologize?

501
00:49:32.105 --> 00:49:34.709
What?

502
00:49:34.742 --> 00:49:36.243
Did... Did you?

503
00:49:39.346 --> 00:49:40.782
No. I... I...

504
00:49:40.815 --> 00:49:43.518
Men do strike women sometimes.

505
00:49:43.551 --> 00:49:45.720
It's not nice, but it's not
a capital offense.

506
00:49:48.255 --> 00:49:49.189
What?

507
00:49:49.223 --> 00:49:52.259
You prefer things
to be comfortable or true?

508
00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:56.531
Might it be true

509
00:49:56.564 --> 00:49:59.132
that if you'd given him
the chance to apologize,

510
00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:00.467
he'd still be alive?

511
00:50:04.137 --> 00:50:05.239
Fuck off.

512
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:10.745
Aren't these the questions
you asked?

513
00:50:10.778 --> 00:50:12.212
Fuck off!

514
00:52:33.721 --> 00:52:34.722
"P-O"...

515
00:52:36.423 --> 00:52:38.225
"P-O" something, something.

516
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.463
"G," come on, Geoffrey,
fire up the engines.

517
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.736
Ah! Pomegranate. Very good.

518
00:52:58.311 --> 00:52:59.681
Ah! Mrs... Ms...

519
00:52:59.714 --> 00:53:02.249
Ms. Marlowe.

520
00:53:02.282 --> 00:53:03.918
Come to paint
the village red, eh?

521
00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:05.419
I just want a drink.

522
00:53:05.452 --> 00:53:06.921
Yeah, I know the feeling well.

523
00:53:08.956 --> 00:53:10.625
What'll it be, Miss?

524
00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:11.959
Um, vodka tonic.

525
00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:13.561
-On its way.
-Oh, hey, let me get it.

526
00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:14.494
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

527
00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:15.830
-Absolutely not. My shout.
-I've got it.

528
00:53:15.863 --> 00:53:16.698
I've got it. Oh, please.

529
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:18.599
Franklin, her money's
no good here.

530
00:53:18.633 --> 00:53:19.734
Right you are.

531
00:53:19.767 --> 00:53:22.570
It seems that you don't
have legal tender.

532
00:53:23.403 --> 00:53:24.404
Thank you.

533
00:53:25.439 --> 00:53:26.574
Just, um, chalk it up.

534
00:53:29.711 --> 00:53:31.378
Settled in okay? No gremlins?

535
00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:35.616
I saw you at the church
a little while ago.

536
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.350
You found
the stained glass window?

537
00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:38.653
You know, at dawn,

538
00:53:38.686 --> 00:53:39.921
the sun shines
straight through it.

539
00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:42.456
It's... It's miraculous.

540
00:53:43.558 --> 00:53:44.959
You'd be bathed in light.

541
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:47.662
Been for a walk yet?

542
00:53:48.963 --> 00:53:50.497
The old railway line.

543
00:53:50.531 --> 00:53:52.432
You can stand there
and imagine the steam trains

544
00:53:52.466 --> 00:53:53.534
-as they...
-Oi to the oi.

545
00:53:53.568 --> 00:53:55.970
- ...pass through the woods.
- Hello, Jimmy.

546
00:53:56.003 --> 00:53:57.270
Frank. Geoff.

547
00:53:57.304 --> 00:53:58.405
-Pint?
-Of course.

548
00:53:59.674 --> 00:54:01.374
Evening, ma'am.

549
00:54:01.408 --> 00:54:03.443
I hope you're
feeling okay now.

550
00:54:03.477 --> 00:54:06.013
-Not too rattled.
-Mm, fine. Thanks.

551
00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:07.682
You heard about that business
at your rental?

552
00:54:07.715 --> 00:54:08.983
My rental? What business?

553
00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:11.052
Yeah.
Intruder on the property.

554
00:54:11.085 --> 00:54:12.452
Or on the grounds, anyway.

555
00:54:12.486 --> 00:54:13.621
Well, surely not.

556
00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:16.758
Some bloke, not a stitch
of clothing on him.

557
00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:17.992
Goodness me.

558
00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:20.027
When the cat's away,
eh?

559
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:21.261
No.

560
00:54:21.863 --> 00:54:22.897
No.

561
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.732
Was a care
of the community type.

562
00:54:24.766 --> 00:54:26.067
Starkers and bonkers, eh?

563
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.401
That's him. Sounds like
you know the guy, Geoff.

564
00:54:28.435 --> 00:54:30.805
- Oh, stop it.
- Did you find out who he is?

565
00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:32.540
Oh, some gyppo, I dare say.

566
00:54:33.007 --> 00:54:34.341
Maybe.

567
00:54:34.374 --> 00:54:36.844
I'm so sorry, Ms. Marlowe.

568
00:54:36.878 --> 00:54:38.411
No, it's not your fault,
Geoffrey.

569
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:39.647
No, it must've been awful
for you.

570
00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.715
It was.

571
00:54:41.649 --> 00:54:43.518
But they have him now, so...

572
00:54:43.551 --> 00:54:44.752
Had him.

573
00:54:44.786 --> 00:54:46.754
Had to release the bugger
about an hour ago.

574
00:54:48.022 --> 00:54:49.356
What?

575
00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:52.093
You released him?

576
00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:54.061
Yeah. Yeah, had to let him go.

577
00:54:54.095 --> 00:54:55.295
Why?

578
00:54:56.264 --> 00:54:58.465
Not much to charge him with,
Miss.

579
00:54:59.466 --> 00:55:01.102
It's not like
he stole anything.

580
00:55:01.135 --> 00:55:02.435
Just one
of your apples, Geoff.

581
00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:04.404
Scrumping! Hang him!

582
00:55:04.437 --> 00:55:05.807
Yeah, we gave him

583
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.675
a jacket and trousers
from lost property.

584
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.511
-Sent him packing.
-He was stalking me.

585
00:55:11.411 --> 00:55:12.445
What makes you say that?

586
00:55:12.479 --> 00:55:13.781
I saw him twice.

587
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:15.683
You saw him twice.

588
00:55:17.919 --> 00:55:19.787
But I don't know
if he saw you once. It's...

589
00:55:20.822 --> 00:55:21.923
It's not quite stalking,
is it?

590
00:55:21.956 --> 00:55:24.091
He followed me
out of the woods,

591
00:55:24.125 --> 00:55:25.893
then tried
to break into the house.

592
00:55:28.428 --> 00:55:29.897
Well,

593
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:31.532
you see him again,
give us a shout.

594
00:55:39.439 --> 00:55:40.440
You're leaving?

595
00:55:42.442 --> 00:55:43.778
Fucking wankers.

596
00:57:17.071 --> 00:57:18.606
Come on, please pick up.

597
00:57:19.874 --> 00:57:21.175
Come on.

598
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.745
<i>-Don't tell me there's more.</i>
-There's more.

599
00:57:25.513 --> 00:57:26.580
<i>What the fuck?</i>

600
00:57:26.614 --> 00:57:27.648
I went for a walk.

601
00:57:27.682 --> 00:57:28.716
I meet a boy in a churchyard

602
00:57:28.749 --> 00:57:30.918
who tells me
I'm a stupid bitch.

603
00:57:30.952 --> 00:57:33.254
Then I meet Vicar who tells me

604
00:57:33.287 --> 00:57:35.957
that I drove James
to kill himself.

605
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:37.558
Then I meet a policeman
who tells me

606
00:57:37.591 --> 00:57:38.926
that they just released
the naked weirdo

607
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.128
who tried to break
into the house yesterday.

608
00:57:41.162 --> 00:57:42.163
And...

609
00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:46.801
I'm... I'm done. I'm done.

610
00:57:46.834 --> 00:57:49.637
I'm just gonna get in the car
and go home.

611
00:57:50.705 --> 00:57:51.739
<i>Fuck this.</i>

612
00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:53.074
-Yeah.
<i>-No.</i>

613
00:57:53.107 --> 00:57:56.110
<i>Fuck this. Fuck this shit.</i>

614
00:57:56.143 --> 00:57:59.046
<i>That house was the one thing</i>
<i>that you wanted for yourself.</i>

615
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.782
<i>What you chose</i>
<i>as a place to heal.</i>

616
00:58:01.816 --> 00:58:02.783
<i>And now you have to give it up</i>

617
00:58:02.817 --> 00:58:04.986
<i>because of</i>
<i>some motherfucking nut!</i>

618
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.621
<i>How long did you say</i>
<i>the drive was?</i>

619
00:58:07.655 --> 00:58:08.656
<i>Three hours away?</i>

620
00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:12.159
Four.

621
00:58:12.193 --> 00:58:13.527
<i>I'm gonna do it in three.</i>

622
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:16.230
<i>And you and me, we're gonna</i>
<i>have a good fucking time.</i>

623
00:58:16.263 --> 00:58:17.898
<i>We are.</i>

624
00:58:17.932 --> 00:58:19.200
<i>We're gonna go on walks,</i>

625
00:58:19.233 --> 00:58:21.268
<i>and we're gonna eat</i>
<i>roast dinners.</i>

626
00:58:21.302 --> 00:58:22.570
<i>And ice cream,</i>

627
00:58:22.603 --> 00:58:26.073
<i>and I'm gonna watch you</i>
<i>get pissed in the evenings,</i>

628
00:58:26.107 --> 00:58:30.811
<i>and if that fucking weirdo</i>
<i>comes back,</i>

629
00:58:30.845 --> 00:58:32.980
<i>I'm gonna take that ax</i>
<i>and chop his dick off,</i>

630
00:58:33.014 --> 00:58:34.582
<i>and he can</i>
<i>fucking choke on it.</i>

631
00:58:35.116 --> 00:58:36.250
What ax?

632
00:58:37.018 --> 00:58:38.152
<i>Behind you.</i>

633
00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:41.188
<i>So, do we do it?</i>

634
00:58:41.222 --> 00:58:43.758
<i>Just five minutes for me</i>
<i>to stick some shit in a bag,</i>

635
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:45.926
<i>and I'll rag it up</i>
<i>the motorway.</i>

636
00:58:47.628 --> 00:58:49.063
Okay.

637
00:58:49.096 --> 00:58:50.531
<i>So, what's the address?</i>

638
00:58:52.066 --> 00:58:53.968
Uh, hang on a second.

639
00:58:56.337 --> 00:58:57.805
Okay.

640
00:59:02.043 --> 00:59:04.245
Just a minute.

641
00:59:04.278 --> 00:59:06.013
-Have you got a pen?
<i>-Yes.</i>

642
00:59:06.047 --> 00:59:09.016
Okay, the village
is called Cotson.

643
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:16.023
And the postcode, uh...
The postcode is HL89 3XR.

644
00:59:17.058 --> 00:59:18.692
The house is called
Cotson Manor.

645
00:59:18.726 --> 00:59:20.895
Shit.

646
00:59:24.065 --> 00:59:26.167
Come on.

647
00:59:29.036 --> 00:59:30.304
-Oh, hi.
<i>-Hi. Hi.</i>

648
00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:32.073
-Did you get any of that?
<i>-No.</i>

649
00:59:33.307 --> 00:59:36.077
Okay, the village
is called Cotson.

650
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:37.978
C-O-T-S-O-N.

651
00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:41.248
And the postcode is HL89...

652
00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:56.797
Right.

653
01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:04.265
What is it? What's happened?

654
01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:10.671
What are you doing here?

655
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.341
Has he come back?

656
01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:19.680
Why aren't you replying?

657
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:25.119
What the fuck?

658
01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.015
Why are you...

659
01:01:56.884 --> 01:01:58.752
Why are you doing this?

660
01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.086
I have a weapon!

661
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.623
I said I have a weapon!

662
01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:43.390
If you come in here,
I'm going to use it!

663
01:03:45.527 --> 01:03:48.062
Ms. Marlowe, what on earth
are you talking about?

664
01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:49.897
Geoff...

665
01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:53.033
What the hell is going on?

666
01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:55.402
I heard screaming,
and then a window break.

667
01:03:57.037 --> 01:03:59.273
There... There was someone.

668
01:04:00.307 --> 01:04:02.209
Someone tried to break in.

669
01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:04.244
Was it that bloody man?
Has he come back?

670
01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:05.613
No. Don't!

671
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.025
Oh, God!

672
01:04:23.698 --> 01:04:25.165
Oh, you poor thing.

673
01:04:30.471 --> 01:04:32.139
Oh, so sorry, old girl.

674
01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:35.008
Oh, don't look Ms. Marlowe.

675
01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:40.582
Sorry about that.

676
01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:44.952
The broken wing, you see.
Nothing to be done.

677
01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:47.522
But I quite understand
why it gave you a fright.

678
01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.424
But there was someone outside.

679
01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:54.995
He tried to get in,
tried to kick the door in.

680
01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:56.897
-Who?
-The policeman.

681
01:04:57.665 --> 01:05:00.100
-What?
-I saw the policeman.

682
01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:01.468
And another man.

683
01:05:02.503 --> 01:05:05.172
I'm not making this up.

684
01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:08.075
Ms. Marlowe,
you don't strike me as a liar.

685
01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:09.109
I believe you.

686
01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:11.579
After all, it's already
happened once today, no?

687
01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.282
And, uh...

688
01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:19.253
Well, as your landlord,
it now falls on me

689
01:05:19.286 --> 01:05:20.354
to have a...

690
01:05:21.321 --> 01:05:22.356
a good look around.

691
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:24.458
Clear all of this up.

692
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:26.460
No, Geoffrey,
don't go outside.

693
01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:28.328
No, nonsense.

694
01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:30.264
Damsel in distress,
I'm just the fellow.

695
01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:31.498
Geoffrey, don't!

696
01:05:35.436 --> 01:05:37.171
"You have precisely
the qualities

697
01:05:37.204 --> 01:05:39.006
"of a failed military man."

698
01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:42.109
What?

699
01:05:42.142 --> 01:05:43.310
Father told me that.

700
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:47.181
I was only seven years old.

701
01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:49.517
Time we showed him
what's what, eh?

702
01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:02.095
Geoffrey?

703
01:06:05.098 --> 01:06:06.133
That's better.

704
01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:11.706
All clear here.

705
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:41.603
Now, look here!

706
01:06:43.505 --> 01:06:45.205
Whoever's out there,

707
01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:47.140
I don't know what you think
you're playing at, but...

708
01:06:48.175 --> 01:06:49.677
it's not gonna sit well
with me.

709
01:06:51.345 --> 01:06:52.446
Not one bit.

710
01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:55.583
Do you hear?

711
01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.791
Seems to me
like they might've gone.

712
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.968
You really hurt me.

713
01:13:00.915 --> 01:13:02.083
Look what you did.

714
01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:05.720
Stay away from me.

715
01:13:07.588 --> 01:13:08.723
What are you gonna do now?

716
01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.125
Hurt me again?

717
01:13:11.893 --> 01:13:12.960
Stab me again?

718
01:13:14.595 --> 01:13:16.697
You're so mean.

719
01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:18.699
You wouldn't even play a game
of hide and seek.

720
01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:23.470
But I think you will now.

721
01:13:24.672 --> 01:13:27.074
I will fucking cut you.

722
01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.117
I'll do it.

723
01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:38.552
I don't think you will.

724
01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.204
But you probably should.

725
01:13:59.073 --> 01:14:00.741
It'll be the last chance
you get.

726
01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:07.848
Good, so you're hiding.

727
01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:09.984
I'll count to ten.

728
01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:12.153
One,

729
01:14:13.788 --> 01:14:14.789
two...

730
01:14:17.558 --> 01:14:18.592
three...

731
01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:21.095
four...

732
01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:22.596
You should be finding
somewhere to hide,

733
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:23.698
I know where you are.

734
01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:24.732
...five,

735
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.201
six,

736
01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:30.037
seven,

737
01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:32.840
eight,

738
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:35.876
nine,

739
01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.014
ten.

740
01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:46.187
Ready or not, here I come.

741
01:16:05.699 --> 01:16:07.201
"A shudder in the loins

742
01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:09.603
"engenders there

743
01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.139
"The broken wall,

744
01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:15.242
"the burning roof and tower

745
01:16:17.912 --> 01:16:19.146
"And Agamemnon

746
01:16:22.016 --> 01:16:23.117
"dead."

747
01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:55.382
What the fuck are you?

748
01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:03.257
A swan.

749
01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:17.638
When did you
lose your virginity?

750
01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:24.211
What?

751
01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:28.015
I'm asking you at what age
you lost your virginity.

752
01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:34.121
I've been thinking about it.

753
01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.691
I have pictured you.

754
01:17:39.793 --> 01:17:41.128
Legs open.

755
01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:44.798
Vagina open.

756
01:17:48.035 --> 01:17:49.203
Mouth open.

757
01:17:51.739 --> 01:17:56.710
I have decided that you are
an expert in carnality.

758
01:17:59.146 --> 01:18:02.383
Someone who has explored

759
01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.718
all the things
that they can do,

760
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.088
and have done to them.

761
01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:18.399
These things now exist
in my mind.

762
01:18:21.802 --> 01:18:24.071
This is your power.

763
01:18:26.106 --> 01:18:29.243
This is the control
that you exert.

764
01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:41.255
"I must be won,
that cannot win,

765
01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:45.426
"Yet lost were I not won,

766
01:18:47.127 --> 01:18:51.065
"For beauty hath been created
to undo...

767
01:18:55.402 --> 01:18:56.971
"or be undone."

768
01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:10.818
You are singing to me.

769
01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:18.259
Not as Ulysses but as sailor.

770
01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:24.031
To dash me to pieces

771
01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:29.036
on the rocks of this...

772
01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:33.874
These rocks.

773
01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:35.943
This...

774
01:19:37.077 --> 01:19:38.513
cave.

775
01:19:38.546 --> 01:19:39.847
This...

776
01:19:40.515 --> 01:19:42.182
slit.

777
01:19:42.216 --> 01:19:44.485
This...

778
01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:48.022
What is this?

779
01:19:54.228 --> 01:19:55.229
Yes.

780
01:19:57.464 --> 01:19:58.499
Exactly.

781
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:02.169
It's the tip of the blade.

782
01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:23.277
Geoffrey.

783
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:24.512
No, no, no.

784
01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:26.280
No, no, no.

785
01:22:26.313 --> 01:22:27.347
No, no.

786
01:22:44.465 --> 01:22:45.999
Ms. Marlowe?

787
01:22:55.175 --> 01:22:56.977
Mrs. Marlowe!

788
01:33:21.402 --> 01:33:22.903
Look at me, Harper.

789
01:33:30.244 --> 01:33:31.345
So I died.

790
01:33:33.681 --> 01:33:36.150
My arm was ripped through
by an iron railing.

791
01:33:39.153 --> 01:33:40.721
My ankle snapped.

792
01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:43.924
My internal organs, crushed.

793
01:33:44.859 --> 01:33:46.627
This is what you did.

794
01:33:54.702 --> 01:33:55.803
James...

795
01:33:59.006 --> 01:34:00.741
What is it
that you want from me?

796
01:34:05.279 --> 01:34:06.647
Your love.

797
01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.063
Yeah.
