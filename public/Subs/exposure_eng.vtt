00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:21.991
<i>Good morning, New York.</i>

2
00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:25.695
<i>And a happy Friday to all
you survivors out there,</i>

3
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.730
<i>Streamin' Steve Spears on
the airwaves here.</i>

4
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:30.398
<i>And I will be broadcasting
live 24/7</i>

5
00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:34.904
<i>for the next three days as we
approach the end of the world.</i>

6
00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:37.372
<i>Ooooh.</i>

7
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.647
Thank you, Cam.

8
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.247
<i>Whatever you want to talk</i>

9
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.249
<i>about feel free to
give me a call.</i>

10
00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:50.028
<i>Look, we can talk shit out,
send messages to loved ones</i>

11
00:02:50.052 --> 00:02:52.172
<i>or even just request your
favorite apocalyptic tracks.</i>

12
00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:58.460
How are you holding up?

13
00:02:58.493 --> 00:03:00.395
I need a fucking drink.

14
00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:04.700
Won't do you any good.

15
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.468
<i>This is, of course</i>

16
00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:08.503
<i>unless Hazel calls me.</i>

17
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.816
<i>Hazel, I know you're out there
and I hope you're listening.</i>

18
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.017
<i>Music brought us together once,</i>

19
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.541
<i>and I know it will again.</i>

20
00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.477
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

21
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.580
<i>They say we got three
days left before Mother Nature</i>

22
00:03:17.613 --> 00:03:20.649
<i>turns on us for good,
ending our stay</i>

23
00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.852
<i>on Planet Earth
once and for all.</i>

24
00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:24.763
<i>This isn't the universe,
stretching its arms out</i>

25
00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.555
<i>and rolling over in bed.</i>

26
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.423
<i>This is the sheets
being stripped</i>

27
00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.325
<i>and the mattress being changed.</i>

28
00:03:30.358 --> 00:03:32.661
<i>We're talking biblical
stuff here, people.</i>

29
00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.663
You're a good man.

30
00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.033
<i>We got some news to start</i>

31
00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.301
<i>you off today. Whether you're
commuting, or evacuating,</i>

32
00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:41.904
<i>or shacked up in your apartment</i>

33
00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:43.505
<i>there are a few things
you should know</i>

34
00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:45.473
<i>on this beautiful final Friday.</i>

35
00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:47.442
They didn't give me
a goddamn chance.

36
00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:48.620
When they saw
I wasn't playing along

37
00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:49.912
with what they wanted me to,

38
00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:51.379
they cast me
out into the streets.

39
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:54.016
Wouldn't let us back in.

40
00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:57.519
Well, you're stubborn.

41
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.522
And schizophrenic.

42
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:03.893
But they didn't know that.

43
00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.027
<i>We've all heard about</i>

44
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.929
<i>the hurricanes down south.</i>

45
00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:10.431
<i>The devastation caused
has been absolutely surreal.</i>

46
00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:12.077
<i>Governors in five states
have now declared</i>

47
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.069
<i>a state of emergency
and are enforcing</i>

48
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:15.871
<i>mandatory evacuation.</i>

49
00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.072
Doesn't matter now anyway.

50
00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:19.942
We stood no chance
since we got here.

51
00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:24.445
I shouldn't go to bed
cold and hungry every night.

52
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.115
<i>In a similar story</i>

53
00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:27.859
<i>he overwhelming earthquake
out west last week</i>

54
00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:29.585
<i>has left millions
missing or displaced.</i>

55
00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:31.654
<i>Many considering this to be
the big one</i>

56
00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:33.488
<i>prophesied for so many years.</i>

57
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.523
<i>Residents all along the coast
have been left</i>

58
00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:38.526
<i>without food, water
or electricity.</i>

59
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.130
<i>You can check with the U.S.
Environmental Agency's website</i>

60
00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:43.132
<i>for a list of missing persons.</i>

61
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.568
<i>And if you have any information,</i>

62
00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:47.837
<i>please don't hesitate to call.</i>

63
00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:51.807
These streets are a
goddamn death sentence.

64
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.142
<i>Today marks the first day</i>

65
00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:54.743
<i>of the U.S. border closure.</i>

66
00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:56.812
<i>The president announced
early last week</i>

67
00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:59.715
<i>that the US would halt aid
for asylum seekers.</i>

68
00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:02.483
<i>Where flights have been able
to take off and land safely</i>

69
00:05:02.517 --> 00:05:04.385
<i>airlines are doing
their absolute best</i>

70
00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.689
<i>to get people back
to their loved ones.</i>

71
00:05:06.722 --> 00:05:09.424
<i>The President officially
declared that all flights</i>

72
00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:11.994
<i>will be grounded starting
Saturday evening.</i>

73
00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.529
I found a roll of film.

74
00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:18.133
One last project?

75
00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.436
My swan song.

76
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.005
<i>Some local news,</i>

77
00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:24.616
<i>New York Board of Elections
has suspended</i>

78
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.017
<i>any campaign activities
for the upcoming.</i>

79
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:27.943
<i>New York City mayor candidates.</i>

80
00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:30.478
<i>A.W. Curry, the restauranteur
and real estate mogul</i>

81
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:32.480
<i>has had a contentious
relationship with the board</i>

82
00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:34.984
<i>since he announced
his candidacy last year.</i>

83
00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.661
<i>When he was asked about
the board's decision,</i>

84
00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.554
<i>he spit in
the face of a reporter</i>

85
00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:40.656
<i>and yelled a racial slur at him.</i>

86
00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.523
<i>He's held steady support
in the race.</i>

87
00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:44.960
<i>But does it even matter?</i>

88
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:46.595
<i>New York officials have insisted</i>

89
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.797
<i>that people evacuate the city.</i>

90
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.734
<i>Get off the island
of Manhattan, people!</i>

91
00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:56.437
<i>But, if you feel
like sticking around</i>

92
00:05:56.471 --> 00:06:00.643
<i>tune into WWHH for all
your apocalyptic needs.</i>

93
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.045
You'll be the opening picture.

94
00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:06.749
The first
ambassador to a lost past.

95
00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:17.492
"Dear Cameron, thank you
once again..."

96
00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:20.029
Consideration for
The New York Journal News.

97
00:06:20.062 --> 00:06:22.231
We regret to inform you that
due to

98
00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:24.667
our current circumstances
we are unable to accept

99
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.136
your photographs
for publication.

100
00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.537
"We wish you continued
success in..." Fuck.

101
00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.576
I've got to go.

102
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:37.579
See you around.

103
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:48.958
Help! Somebody help me!

104
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:50.491
Give me your bag, bitch!

105
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:51.961
Fuck you! Get off of me!

106
00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:03.973
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Give me the fucking bag.

107
00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:16.618
Are you all right?

108
00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:18.954
I'm fine.

109
00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:20.055
Here.

110
00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:22.124
Take it.

111
00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:40.576
Fucking asshole.

112
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:48.017
Hello?

113
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.294
<i>You are going
to help me though, right?</i>

114
00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.887
Yeah, man. Come on in.

115
00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:57.659
Oh, shit, it's the film guy.

116
00:07:58.594 --> 00:07:59.895
Trevor.

117
00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:04.566
- Cam. It's Cam.
- Cam, Cam.

118
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.136
Oh, right, right. Sorry, man.

119
00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:08.971
I'm terrible with names.

120
00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:12.540
- May I?
- Mm! Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:15.010
Of course.

122
00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:23.085
- What happened to him?
- Oh, yo.

123
00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:25.754
He just took a big batch
of brown sugar man.

124
00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:27.890
He's out cold.

125
00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:31.627
- That's unfortunate.
- Yo, this is, um...

126
00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:35.164
No, no, you're good. You good.

127
00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:37.966
Man, he's pop-tarted
right now, dude.

128
00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:42.770
Uh, just in the middle
of rolling this joint.

129
00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:45.140
I'll finish up, and
then we can do some business.

130
00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:47.309
<i>Remember why you're doing this.</i>

131
00:08:47.342 --> 00:08:49.611
<i>You'll keep your word?</i>

132
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.185
What happened there?

133
00:08:56.218 --> 00:08:58.687
Oh, yo, dude,

134
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.989
all this bullshit going
on this weekend,

135
00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:05.060
I said to myself,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

136
00:09:05.094 --> 00:09:06.995
You know,
who are these motherfuckers

137
00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.698
trying to tell me
when I'm going to die?

138
00:09:09.731 --> 00:09:12.668
I said,
I want control of my end, dude.

139
00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:14.169
I want control.

140
00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:17.372
You know, your life
is truly in your own hands

141
00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:19.675
when you can take it
from yourself.

142
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.945
- Makes sense.
- Anyway, I would have

143
00:09:22.978 --> 00:09:24.346
gone through with it too,

144
00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.215
if this motherfucker
didn't show up

145
00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:28.183
and drag my ass to the hospital.

146
00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:46.335
- The fuck, dude?
- Oh, last roll.

147
00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:49.705
Oh. Well, in that case...

148
00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:57.980
Um...

149
00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:22.037
No justice, no freedom, man.

150
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.439
You know, now everyone's
worried about me.

151
00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:26.308
You know, my friends,
little sister is coming

152
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.945
to check up on me, like, I
don't need to be looked after.

153
00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:32.781
I need to be set free.

154
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.119
It's just unbelievable, man.

155
00:10:37.152 --> 00:10:39.154
Sometimes when you
want to be left alone,

156
00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:41.757
people just won't let you be.

157
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:49.031
Oh, excellent.

158
00:10:56.972 --> 00:10:58.907
Oh, uh...

159
00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:04.246
Oh!

160
00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:10.452
Uh, yeah, mm-hm.

161
00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:12.254
Jesus Christ, Ed.

162
00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:16.291
Coinage is coinage, brother.

163
00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:22.097
Listen, Ed.

164
00:11:23.298 --> 00:11:25.067
Take care of yourself.

165
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.878
Don't let the world
get the best of you, all right?

166
00:11:26.902 --> 00:11:28.971
Uh-huh. That's
what I'm saying, man.

167
00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:32.941
Go out in control.
Like, full control, baby.

168
00:11:50.158 --> 00:11:52.361
Excuse me. Could I get a light?

169
00:12:04.574 --> 00:12:06.074
Thank you.

170
00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:12.547
Rough day?

171
00:12:13.849 --> 00:12:16.251
The usual. You?

172
00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:19.988
As long as people are around,
I'm okay.

173
00:12:21.256 --> 00:12:22.991
That's one
way of thinking about it.

174
00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:30.399
They'll kill you.

175
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.436
Then we shall perish together.

176
00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:40.542
Enjoy it.

177
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:27.022
<i>At the tone, please

180
00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:22.537
The most popular man
in New York returns.

181
00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:27.242
- Hey, dude.
- What's up, man? Come on in.

182
00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:31.046
It's good to see you, man.

183
00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:34.049
Dude, it's good to
fucking see <i>you,</i> my man.

184
00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:36.518
I mean, I haven't heard
from you in a little bit.

185
00:15:36.552 --> 00:15:39.555
Yeah, I've been...
I've been holed up,

186
00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:42.190
I haven't been coping
too well with the news.

187
00:15:42.224 --> 00:15:44.125
Yeah, dude, who is?

188
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:47.295
Like, I'll tell you, I can't...
I can't face the music either.

189
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:49.064
So how much do you need?

190
00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:51.032
How much you got?

191
00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:52.702
More than you need.

192
00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:55.638
Dude, everybody wants as much
as they can get right now.

193
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:57.707
So why don't you
just come in, relax.

194
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.675
- Would you like a beer?
- You got beer?

195
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.376
Yeah, I got beer.

196
00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:03.613
Because I stashed up
before everyone went out.

197
00:16:03.646 --> 00:16:06.047
Oh, my man, my man.

198
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:16.057
Oh, hello.

199
00:16:17.593 --> 00:16:20.328
- So, you're Cam?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.298
Nick says
great things about you.

201
00:16:24.499 --> 00:16:25.801
Really?

202
00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:28.503
How was
the rest of that cigarette?

203
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.641
Nearly killed me. Always does.

204
00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:37.546
I'm Katie. I'm Nick's younger
sister.

205
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.650
Nice to meet you.
Officially, I guess.

206
00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:48.691
May I?

207
00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:04.306
You know, some people
might find that creepy.

208
00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.273
Taking pictures of
random young women.

209
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:08.844
Where the fuck did I put it?

210
00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:10.780
Are you a photographer?

211
00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:12.213
Tried to be.

212
00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:13.616
What happened?

213
00:17:13.648 --> 00:17:15.517
Doesn't matter.

214
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.352
Sounds like it matters.

215
00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:19.487
- Shit.
- Civility is hard

216
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:22.290
to maintain in times like these.

217
00:17:23.157 --> 00:17:25.093
I lost my mentor.

218
00:17:26.596 --> 00:17:27.906
Well, he
doesn't determine whether

219
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.799
you're a photographer or not.

220
00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:33.301
I suppose, but <i>she</i> determines
whether I work or not.

221
00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:35.503
- I could kill her for you.
- I already did.

222
00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.708
Hey, Katie,
where's the bottle opener?

223
00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:45.347
Where's the...

224
00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:49.852
I hear you carry a lot.

225
00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:51.486
Where do you get it?

226
00:17:56.224 --> 00:17:59.629
I spend too much time in musty
rooms with dubious people.

227
00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:03.164
Ooh, sounds dangerous.

228
00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.400
Let me guess.

229
00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:07.302
Rough upbringing.

230
00:18:07.335 --> 00:18:08.871
Mom and dad fought a lot.

231
00:18:08.904 --> 00:18:11.874
So, you came to the
city to try to escape it all,

232
00:18:11.907 --> 00:18:14.644
only to get sucked into
the underground world

233
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:18.313
of the prescription drug trade,
saving hookers

234
00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:21.316
from abusive
pimps in your free time.

235
00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:23.351
A marked man just trying
to see this whole thing

236
00:18:23.385 --> 00:18:24.787
through to the end.

237
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.521
Always in survival
mode with your enemies

238
00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.924
constantly
breathing down your neck.

239
00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.593
Close.

240
00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:33.863
I was raised by my mom
and my two older sisters,

241
00:18:33.896 --> 00:18:36.732
but you'd be surprised
at how similar

242
00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:38.567
those two situations can be.

243
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.409
It sounds like there's
a lot of women in your life.

244
00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:50.278
Any room for me?

245
00:18:50.946 --> 00:18:52.948
Where the fuck did I put it?

246
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:57.753
So, what's your story?

247
00:18:57.787 --> 00:19:00.422
- I have no story.
- Come on.

248
00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:02.424
Everyone's got something.

249
00:19:06.662 --> 00:19:07.730
Dropped out of school.

250
00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.933
Arrived in
New York the other day.

251
00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:14.402
All this talk of the end,
and I figured I'd leave home.

252
00:19:15.604 --> 00:19:17.807
Little did I know that
New York would be running low

253
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.576
on food and supplies
and all that would be left

254
00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:25.313
would be... coffee and
prescription drugs.

255
00:19:26.514 --> 00:19:28.751
Regardless, I left
after class a few weeks ago

256
00:19:28.784 --> 00:19:30.019
and never looked back.

257
00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:32.688
Well, I'm a college dropout too.

258
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.694
- High school.
- Oh my God.

259
00:19:41.997 --> 00:19:45.400
Fuck! Ah!

260
00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:47.636
Death came early back home.

261
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.504
It was a ghost town
before I left,

262
00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:52.373
and I didn't want to sit around
wallowing in self-pity.

263
00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:53.976
So...

264
00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:55.310
Motherfucker.

265
00:19:55.343 --> 00:19:57.278
I need other souls to cling to.

266
00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:00.916
Well, sometimes solitude
is the best companion.

267
00:20:01.717 --> 00:20:04.319
Are you saying you
won't be my friend?

268
00:20:04.352 --> 00:20:05.888
What I'm saying is I'm
wondering if

269
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:08.891
you're implying that Nick
has a soul.

270
00:20:11.894 --> 00:20:14.362
There's something in
everyone worth salvaging.

271
00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:16.565
Motherfucker!

272
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.977
Nick, the bottle opener
is in here.

273
00:20:28.844 --> 00:20:30.345
Did you not hear me yelling?

274
00:20:30.378 --> 00:20:31.981
I was yelling for
five fucking minutes.

275
00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:36.886
Oh, Katie. Oh my God.
Oh, it's right there.

276
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.291
Thank you.

277
00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:51.332
Thanks.

278
00:20:52.467 --> 00:20:53.836
The fuck.

279
00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:56.639
What?

280
00:20:57.405 --> 00:20:59.474
Uh, nothing. Um...

281
00:20:59.507 --> 00:21:01.076
So, you guys met?

282
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.081
Hey, Cam, isn't she just,
like a... like a bundle of joy?

283
00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:07.716
Yeah, man.

284
00:21:10.152 --> 00:21:11.620
So how did you two meet?

285
00:21:12.487 --> 00:21:14.389
We met through Cam's girlfriend.

286
00:21:14.422 --> 00:21:17.693
- Oh, I'd love to meet her.
- No, it's not really like that.

287
00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:20.863
She already left a while ago.

288
00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:23.732
Hey, why don't we,
you know, get down to business?

289
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.769
- Yeah. Let's do that.
- Yeah.

290
00:21:34.076 --> 00:21:36.879
Awesome. How much?

291
00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:38.981
- It's 50 a pill.
- Woo!

292
00:21:40.749 --> 00:21:42.027
What about for the whole bottle?

293
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.819
You do not
need the whole bottle.

294
00:21:43.853 --> 00:21:45.386
I do not need the whole bottle.

295
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.389
But I do want the whole bottle.
How much?

296
00:21:51.459 --> 00:21:54.597
Um...

297
00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:59.500
2500.

298
00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:02.605
Phenomenal.

299
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.407
Hey, I'm sorry.

300
00:22:06.441 --> 00:22:07.877
I got to take this.

301
00:22:12.214 --> 00:22:13.883
What else do you have?

302
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.752
I got anything you need
that a doctor prescribes.

303
00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:18.821
But I do not sell
to little girls.

304
00:22:18.854 --> 00:22:21.690
"Little girl," fuck you.

305
00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:24.425
I never had the chance
to be a little girl.

306
00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:26.595
How much will this get me?

307
00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:37.973
Enough.

308
00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:39.842
Then I'll take enough.

309
00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:49.961
You sure your brother is going
to be all right with this?

310
00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:52.821
Don't worry
about my big brother.

311
00:22:52.855 --> 00:22:55.490
I take care of him.
He doesn't take care of me.

312
00:22:55.523 --> 00:22:59.895
Hey, Cam, here you go, my man.
Should all be there.

313
00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:08.771
Excellent.

314
00:23:11.573 --> 00:23:13.842
Cam, why don't you stay?
You know, have another beer.

315
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.146
Can't, more customers.

316
00:23:18.714 --> 00:23:20.582
Not a lot of places
have beer right now, man.

317
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:21.817
Yes, I know.

318
00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:25.054
Too many customers, bro.

319
00:23:28.057 --> 00:23:29.490
I'll walk you out.

320
00:23:33.128 --> 00:23:34.830
Nice meeting you.

321
00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:36.865
I'm sure I'll see you around.

322
00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:45.908
- Hey, Cam?
- Yeah.

323
00:23:45.941 --> 00:23:47.242
I was wondering if you could

324
00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:49.011
possibly help me out
with something.

325
00:23:49.044 --> 00:23:50.713
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

326
00:23:50.746 --> 00:23:52.815
There are these rumors
going around that there

327
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.616
might be a way out of this mess.

328
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.185
Yo, I don't listen
to rumors anymore.

329
00:23:56.218 --> 00:23:58.821
Yeah. I know. Listen,
it's a community upstate,

330
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:02.224
and they have a facility that
they are charging a fee for.

331
00:24:02.891 --> 00:24:06.628
You get complete access
to their bunker, I guess.

332
00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:08.630
- It's a bunker.
- A bunker?

333
00:24:08.664 --> 00:24:11.233
Yeah, a bunker. They have a
facility under the surface.

334
00:24:11.266 --> 00:24:13.602
I have half have the money.
Okay, I do.

335
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:15.204
I just need
a little bit of help.

336
00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:18.140
And if you can help, then me,
you, and Katie,

337
00:24:18.173 --> 00:24:20.109
we can all go together
and just...

338
00:24:20.142 --> 00:24:22.044
Just see if it's for real.

339
00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:23.712
Where did
you get the first half?

340
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.547
Why does that matter?

341
00:24:26.582 --> 00:24:30.185
You're coming to me, asking
for my help, for my money.

342
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:31.820
I'm going to need some details.

343
00:24:31.854 --> 00:24:33.188
Okay.

344
00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:35.324
Um, a couple guys who
take themselves

345
00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:38.160
way too fucking seriously.

346
00:24:38.193 --> 00:24:39.671
The quicker we get the money,
you know,

347
00:24:39.695 --> 00:24:41.006
the less
likely we'll have to see them.

348
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.998
Do you hear how this sounds?

349
00:24:43.032 --> 00:24:44.600
Look, I'm
not giving you the money.

350
00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:46.735
Okay, if I don't get the money,

351
00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:49.138
I'm going to be up to my neck
in shit.

352
00:24:49.171 --> 00:24:50.239
Nick...

353
00:24:52.841 --> 00:24:55.277
- Listen...
- Okay. What about Katie?

354
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.980
What about her?
She's got no place to go.

355
00:24:58.013 --> 00:24:59.013
If I'm gone...

356
00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:04.253
Can't let a girl like that on
her own, man.

357
00:25:05.054 --> 00:25:06.622
Nick...

358
00:25:08.323 --> 00:25:11.093
Don't do drugs
if you need the money.

359
00:25:11.693 --> 00:25:13.762
I can't help that.

360
00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:16.799
Okay? This is all too much to
fucking handle sometimes.

361
00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:20.335
I need these.

362
00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:27.609
Look, I don't know
if I want to live

363
00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:29.211
if this shit
really hits the fan.

364
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:31.713
Maybe you
should call your parents.

365
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.782
I don't know where
the fuck they are, man.

366
00:25:33.816 --> 00:25:35.918
They're gone.
They abandoned her.

367
00:25:37.052 --> 00:25:38.353
Fuck, I don't know if they ever

368
00:25:38.387 --> 00:25:39.855
cared about us in
the first place.

369
00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:46.061
If you want to survive, you
need to get out of the city.

370
00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:48.197
This is the worst place
that you could possibly be.

371
00:25:48.864 --> 00:25:51.266
Now, I'm sorry.

372
00:25:53.168 --> 00:25:55.070
I'm not giving you
the money, bro.

373
00:25:55.938 --> 00:25:59.308
But if you need anything,
you call me. All right?

374
00:26:56.265 --> 00:26:58.033
How long has this been going on?

375
00:26:58.066 --> 00:27:00.435
Mm, off and on for the
past couple of days.

376
00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:10.012
So how are you?

377
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:11.313
Business is busy.

378
00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:15.184
I still have a ton of stuff,

379
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.919
so I won't be bothering
you for more.

380
00:27:20.856 --> 00:27:22.124
Eat.

381
00:27:28.497 --> 00:27:30.098
Have you talked to your mom?

382
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.735
Not since Rachel left.

383
00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:36.405
Your sisters? Anybody?

384
00:27:37.372 --> 00:27:39.074
Not since Rachel left.

385
00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.877
There's just you.

386
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.879
They've helped
you kick this before, Cam,

387
00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:45.480
they can help you again.

388
00:27:46.882 --> 00:27:49.117
Now you're
done with this place, huh?

389
00:27:49.151 --> 00:27:51.420
Yeah, I figure I just
drive out northwest,

390
00:27:52.487 --> 00:27:55.324
see how far I can get
until he catches up with me.

391
00:27:57.926 --> 00:27:59.294
Oh.

392
00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.767
In the event that this
doesn't end up

393
00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:07.369
the worst-case scenario...

394
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:10.472
You should have this place.

395
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.743
I always figured you
were a true believer.

396
00:28:16.545 --> 00:28:20.048
I think we're moving toward
something really terrible.

397
00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:22.552
Yeah.

398
00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:24.953
However,
beautiful things can happen

399
00:28:24.987 --> 00:28:27.122
when the reset button gets hit.

400
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.026
Are you a good person?

401
00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:34.196
Tried to be.

402
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.302
I don't think I am.

403
00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:43.972
Cam, you've
got good in your heart.

404
00:28:45.107 --> 00:28:46.942
You're going to be just fine.

405
00:28:49.612 --> 00:28:50.979
No.

406
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.119
You know, one thing
keeps popping into my mind.

407
00:29:00.122 --> 00:29:02.958
It's, uh, from when I was a kid.

408
00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:07.162
We're at this amusement park.

409
00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:09.031
My dad was still alive.

410
00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:12.301
So my whole family's there.

411
00:29:13.302 --> 00:29:17.306
And I decided to go
and run off by myself.

412
00:29:20.142 --> 00:29:22.578
Most have been gone for hours.

413
00:29:28.283 --> 00:29:31.019
When they found me,
everyone was in a panic.

414
00:29:34.256 --> 00:29:36.892
And it's only the other
day that I thought...

415
00:29:38.093 --> 00:29:40.195
How worried they must have been.

416
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.499
You know? They thought
they lost their boy.

417
00:29:49.672 --> 00:29:51.306
My dad was furious.

418
00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:58.280
I wonder
what he'd think of me now.

419
00:30:02.984 --> 00:30:06.388
I think he'd be proud
that you're a photographer.

420
00:30:06.421 --> 00:30:09.024
I'm not sure I can take any
more of this shit, you know?

421
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:11.526
All the fighting.

422
00:30:12.994 --> 00:30:14.329
All the greed.

423
00:30:15.464 --> 00:30:17.032
All the betrayal.

424
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:21.203
This fucking weather.

425
00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:26.441
- Shut the fuck up!
- Cam.

426
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:29.544
Calm the fuck down.

427
00:30:31.146 --> 00:30:33.415
Let those people
live their lives.

428
00:30:35.618 --> 00:30:37.986
Jesus Christ.

429
00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:40.422
Fuck, Cam, give me that.

430
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:43.925
Look...

431
00:30:45.193 --> 00:30:48.598
I know the pessimistic son of a
bitch you can be, all right?

432
00:30:50.365 --> 00:30:54.336
But there's a lot going
on in the world right now

433
00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:56.538
that you
can draw inspiration from.

434
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.342
I know it's not in the news,
but it's there.

435
00:31:01.309 --> 00:31:05.648
And if I can pull some good
from this, maybe you can, too.

436
00:31:07.482 --> 00:31:10.952
All I know is that we
have an expiration date,

437
00:31:10.986 --> 00:31:13.556
and that
expiration date is Monday.

438
00:31:13.589 --> 00:31:15.591
It's only a matter of
time before this place

439
00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:17.259
gets flushed down
the fucking toilet.

440
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:20.228
Well, maybe I'll stick around

441
00:31:20.262 --> 00:31:22.931
to enjoy this positive attitude
a little longer.

442
00:31:25.735 --> 00:31:28.003
You're right.

443
00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:33.141
Get out of this fucking city.

444
00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:43.985
Plan to document what happens?

445
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.322
They found paper
remains in Pompeii.

446
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.393
So, if the negatives survive...

447
00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:55.765
Give the future
something to dig up.

448
00:31:55.798 --> 00:31:58.033
Well, you were always
pretty good at it.

449
00:32:02.605 --> 00:32:04.139
Tried to be.

450
00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:10.178
Yeah, well, I get it.

451
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:16.151
Yeah, but none
of that matters now.

452
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:18.386
I'm just going to spend
the next three days

453
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.089
coming to terms with
what my purpose was.

454
00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:24.426
What's that?

455
00:32:28.664 --> 00:32:30.666
You keep them numb
until it's over.

456
00:33:20.282 --> 00:33:23.586
<i>Cam, it's your mother.</i>

457
00:33:25.821 --> 00:33:29.592
<i>I don't know why you haven't
spoken to me or your sisters</i>

458
00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:34.462
<i>since the news broke,
but we want to see you.</i>

459
00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:38.466
<i>We know you miss Rachel.
We know you're in despair.</i>

460
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.569
<i>If you...</i>

461
00:35:26.776 --> 00:35:28.744
Help...

462
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.500
Hello?

463
00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:41.136
<i>Hello, Cam?</i>

464
00:38:42.705 --> 00:38:44.139
Yeah. Who's this?

465
00:38:44.173 --> 00:38:46.008
<i>It's Katie, Nick's sister.</i>

466
00:38:46.041 --> 00:38:47.843
<i>Nick's gone.</i>

467
00:38:47.877 --> 00:38:50.646
<i>They... they broke in
and took him.</i>

468
00:39:37.726 --> 00:39:39.561
I tried to call the police,

469
00:39:39.595 --> 00:39:41.697
but I couldn't get
through to anyone.

470
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.799
The police are not
going to do anything.

471
00:39:47.502 --> 00:39:49.502
They said they're going
to come back for the money.

472
00:39:53.676 --> 00:39:55.744
They said
they expect me to pay now.

473
00:39:55.778 --> 00:39:57.212
So you called me?

474
00:39:58.113 --> 00:40:00.049
Who is Nick involved with?

475
00:40:07.089 --> 00:40:08.223
I don't know.

476
00:40:09.558 --> 00:40:11.492
He didn't tell me who they were.

477
00:40:11.526 --> 00:40:12.928
Whose blood?

478
00:40:14.663 --> 00:40:16.098
I cut one of them.

479
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:17.933
Hm.

480
00:40:21.536 --> 00:40:27.810
Um, there's...
There's a fresh towel

481
00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:30.079
and, uh, clean water
in the bathroom.

482
00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:33.048
You can go clean yourself up.

483
00:40:52.735 --> 00:40:54.670
Never been hit like that before.

484
00:40:56.238 --> 00:40:58.140
I don't know what
he got himself into,

485
00:40:58.173 --> 00:41:00.508
but Nick fucked with
the wrong people.

486
00:41:02.911 --> 00:41:05.080
You have to help me.

487
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.094
Um...

488
00:41:20.996 --> 00:41:23.732
Nick and I haven't seen
each other in a while.

489
00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:25.801
Have you thought about
asking his friends?

490
00:41:33.108 --> 00:41:35.978
- You are his friend.
- You know what I mean.

491
00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:38.680
Would Ed know?

492
00:41:40.816 --> 00:41:42.818
I don't know.

493
00:41:42.851 --> 00:41:44.353
You know these people.

494
00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:46.021
You and Nick run in
the same circles.

495
00:41:48.223 --> 00:41:50.225
I have to find him.

496
00:41:50.259 --> 00:41:52.327
If you won't help me,
I'll do it myself.

497
00:41:57.399 --> 00:41:58.700
I'm sorry. I can't.

498
00:42:04.206 --> 00:42:05.607
No, you're not.

499
00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.145
I need a place to stay, then.

500
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:11.313
I can't stay at Nick's.

501
00:42:17.653 --> 00:42:18.733
I guess I can stay with Ed.

502
00:42:19.822 --> 00:42:22.224
I'm not sure that's the best
place for you right now.

503
00:42:22.257 --> 00:42:24.860
I guess that's not really
your fucking problem, is it?

504
00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:31.200
Okay.

505
00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:34.036
Ed's it is.

506
00:43:32.127 --> 00:43:33.896
Don't buy fucking drugs with it.

507
00:43:35.164 --> 00:43:36.365
Don't give it to Ed.

508
00:43:37.299 --> 00:43:38.433
Use it to get home.

509
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.308
Is this how you got rid of me?

510
00:43:52.147 --> 00:43:53.849
You're no fucking help.

511
00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:57.152
See you around.

512
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.158
Okay.

513
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:29.071
Katie we'll be okay, all right?

514
00:46:29.572 --> 00:46:31.273
Everything's going to be fine.

515
00:46:31.641 --> 00:46:33.975
Mom and Dad are going
to come back, and then...

516
00:46:34.009 --> 00:46:37.179
And then we'll be fine.
We'll get out and...

517
00:46:37.212 --> 00:46:38.513
Nick?

518
00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:40.916
And if they
don't come back, then...

519
00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:42.585
Then I'll take
you out of the city.

520
00:46:42.618 --> 00:46:43.952
Okay, we'll go.

521
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.222
Everything's going to be okay.

522
00:46:47.255 --> 00:46:49.091
- I promise.
- Nick.

523
00:46:49.324 --> 00:46:50.459
It was too late.

524
00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:53.596
I needed your help.

525
00:46:54.597 --> 00:46:56.398
- I couldn't.
- You could have.

526
00:46:57.099 --> 00:46:58.266
But now I'm gone.

527
00:46:59.334 --> 00:47:01.169
And I've left
my kid sister all alone

528
00:47:01.203 --> 00:47:02.843
and now you're not
even going to help her.

529
00:47:04.239 --> 00:47:05.507
I was there for you.

530
00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:07.542
With Rachel.

531
00:47:12.214 --> 00:47:13.482
I don't...

532
00:47:16.151 --> 00:47:17.886
I... I don't know where to start.

533
00:47:19.955 --> 00:47:23.626
Cam, just do me
this one favor? Please?

534
00:47:28.163 --> 00:47:29.264
Hey, man, do you mind?

535
00:47:30.265 --> 00:47:32.668
They got fucking
nothing down there.

536
00:51:33.976 --> 00:51:36.879
- Leaving already?
- Ugh, God damn it.

537
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:39.815
You scared me.

538
00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:42.217
I was going to call you, but I...

539
00:51:42.918 --> 00:51:44.386
I know you hate goodbyes.

540
00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:48.390
You showed up
just at the right time.

541
00:51:56.832 --> 00:51:59.702
Lu, whose calling card is this?

542
00:52:02.805 --> 00:52:04.239
Where did you get that?

543
00:52:04.272 --> 00:52:06.241
I got a call from Nick's sister.

544
00:52:06.274 --> 00:52:08.243
She's beat up and he's missing.

545
00:52:08.276 --> 00:52:09.511
Jesus Christ.

546
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:15.685
I don't want any part of this.

547
00:52:15.718 --> 00:52:17.252
I saw this shit at your house,

548
00:52:17.285 --> 00:52:18.721
you're already involved in this.

549
00:52:19.354 --> 00:52:20.923
Which means you
know where it came from.

550
00:52:22.357 --> 00:52:24.827
Now, you can
either help me or not.

551
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.630
But either way,
I'm going to find out.

552
00:52:34.837 --> 00:52:36.572
Belongs to a guy named Curry.

553
00:52:38.273 --> 00:52:39.307
Curry.

554
00:52:40.743 --> 00:52:43.012
He's that slumlord
that's making a run for office.

555
00:52:43.045 --> 00:52:44.647
I don't care about the politics,

556
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.981
I just want to know where he is.

557
00:52:46.015 --> 00:52:47.348
I don't want you to get hurt.

558
00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:53.254
If you give these guys trouble
and they want you gone,

559
00:52:53.288 --> 00:52:55.725
they'll stop at nothing
until they see you dead.

560
00:52:58.728 --> 00:53:01.496
This girl has
nothing to do with you, Cam.

561
00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:03.899
Just go home.

562
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:08.671
Be with your family.

563
00:53:10.039 --> 00:53:11.306
Yeah.

564
00:53:13.008 --> 00:53:14.777
- Cam...
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

565
00:53:16.612 --> 00:53:17.913
I got it.

566
00:53:17.947 --> 00:53:20.281
Hey, come on,
do it for me, all right?

567
00:53:23.418 --> 00:53:25.788
There is too little time
in life to be so angry.

568
00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:40.736
The universe
is going to keep going

569
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:41.937
with or without us.

570
00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:48.476
You be safe, right?

571
00:53:49.444 --> 00:53:50.512
I always am.

572
00:53:53.348 --> 00:53:54.415
Hey yo, Lu.

573
00:53:56.417 --> 00:53:58.888
One last shot
to remember you by?

574
00:53:59.955 --> 00:54:01.023
Of course.

575
00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:21.577
See you on
the other side of the universe.

576
00:55:06.655 --> 00:55:08.023
<i>If you can
provide any information</i>

577
00:55:08.057 --> 00:55:09.825
<i>on the missing persons,
please dial 411</i>

578
00:55:09.859 --> 00:55:12.061
<i>or your local police department</i>

579
00:55:12.094 --> 00:55:13.762
<i>if they haven't been suspended.</i>

580
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:16.497
Still no sign of her yet.

581
00:55:27.877 --> 00:55:28.978
You got a light?

582
00:55:30.012 --> 00:55:31.847
- A lighter.
- Yeah.

583
00:55:36.185 --> 00:55:37.953
Boom, like that.

584
00:55:45.594 --> 00:55:47.062
Don't slip, all right?

585
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:48.898
Did you feed the fish?

586
00:55:51.967 --> 00:55:53.068
Yup.

587
00:55:53.102 --> 00:55:54.169
No, you didn't.

588
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.472
You didn't clean
the fucking tank out.

589
00:55:57.505 --> 00:55:59.942
I got you a dog,
we had to give the dog away.

590
00:55:59.975 --> 00:56:01.844
I got you a cat.
I don't know where that went.

591
00:56:01.877 --> 00:56:03.478
I got you a turtle.

592
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:04.756
Why do you got
to bring the pets up

593
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.915
all the fucking time?

594
00:56:05.948 --> 00:56:07.683
Good evening, gentlemen.

595
00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:09.919
I couldn't help but
notice that you were smoking.

596
00:56:09.952 --> 00:56:11.153
May I?

597
00:56:11.186 --> 00:56:12.554
Yeah, I got you.

598
00:56:13.521 --> 00:56:15.557
So, you fellows from the city?

599
00:56:19.628 --> 00:56:20.863
Yeah, we're from the city.

600
00:56:22.798 --> 00:56:25.000
I... I noticed that you are...

601
00:56:25.034 --> 00:56:26.869
You've been sitting
out here for a while.

602
00:56:28.536 --> 00:56:29.638
Well, we're drivers.

603
00:56:33.676 --> 00:56:35.044
Waiting on a passenger.

604
00:56:35.611 --> 00:56:37.012
That's perfect.

605
00:56:38.213 --> 00:56:39.715
You're going to
put them in the back

606
00:56:39.748 --> 00:56:41.650
- with all your trash?
- Here you go.

607
00:56:41.684 --> 00:56:43.194
Who the fuck kind
of fucking wise guy are you?

608
00:56:43.218 --> 00:56:44.653
Here, take these.

609
00:56:44.687 --> 00:56:45.854
Go ahead.

610
00:56:47.756 --> 00:56:49.058
Keep the whole thing.

611
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:50.568
- No, don't keep...
- Thank you very much.

612
00:56:50.592 --> 00:56:51.961
- You're welcome.
- Sir.

613
00:56:53.762 --> 00:56:55.140
Why did you give
the fucking matches away?

614
00:56:55.164 --> 00:56:57.066
Fuck the matches.
We have a lighter.

615
00:56:57.099 --> 00:56:59.635
I keep the matches,
you know, I collect them.

616
00:56:59.668 --> 00:57:00.803
I know you collect them.

617
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:02.938
We have a lighter.

618
00:57:03.973 --> 00:57:05.083
Do you understand
the concept of lighter?

619
00:57:05.107 --> 00:57:06.875
- So what?
- The lighter has fuel.

620
00:57:06.909 --> 00:57:09.178
You have a thousand
different matches in it.

621
00:57:09.211 --> 00:57:10.980
You don't have to strike.

622
00:57:11.013 --> 00:57:13.514
Why do you have
to give everything away?

623
00:57:13.548 --> 00:57:15.550
They're fucking matches, man.

624
00:57:28.897 --> 00:57:30.032
Fucking asshole.

625
00:57:42.077 --> 00:57:43.145
Hello?

626
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:46.982
Ed?

627
00:57:48.884 --> 00:57:49.952
Katie?

628
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.091
Guy on couch?

629
00:58:37.099 --> 00:58:39.301
Jesus Christ,
you fucking scared me.

630
00:58:41.637 --> 00:58:42.671
Oh.

631
00:58:43.639 --> 00:58:46.041
So you decided
to help find your friend then?

632
00:58:46.075 --> 00:58:47.676
Where have you been?

633
00:58:49.011 --> 00:58:51.713
I went to the Brooklyn Bridge
to look for Ed

634
00:58:51.747 --> 00:58:53.282
because he said
he was going to jump.

635
00:58:54.716 --> 00:58:56.919
He called like 45 minutes ago,
saying to meet back here.

636
00:58:57.986 --> 00:58:59.254
Fuck. Fuck.

637
00:58:59.288 --> 00:59:01.723
Quickly, quickly.
Get in the bathroom.

638
00:59:01.757 --> 00:59:03.225
Get in the bathroom. Come on.

639
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.328
Come on, let's go.

640
00:59:06.361 --> 00:59:09.331
Cam, what the hell is going on?

641
00:59:09.364 --> 00:59:10.632
They found you.

642
00:59:10.666 --> 00:59:12.034
They saw you come in here.

643
00:59:12.067 --> 00:59:13.969
They are coming up
the stairs right now.

644
00:59:14.002 --> 00:59:16.405
Just stay in here
until I come and get you.

645
00:59:16.438 --> 00:59:17.973
Stay here.

646
00:59:19.842 --> 00:59:21.110
Fuck.

647
00:59:22.077 --> 00:59:23.312
Shit.

648
01:00:16.398 --> 01:00:18.700
Boss wants his fucking money.

649
01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:20.035
You are going to give it to him.

650
01:01:18.894 --> 01:01:20.462
<i>Steve Spears back on
the airwaves here.</i>

651
01:01:20.495 --> 01:01:22.231
<i>Authorities
continue to encourage</i>

652
01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:23.841
<i>all Manhattan residents
to evacuate the city.</i>

653
01:01:23.865 --> 01:01:25.267
<i>More threats have come in,</i>

654
01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.135
<i>suggesting most exit routes</i>

655
01:01:27.169 --> 01:01:28.947
<i>out of the greater New York
area are either at risk</i>

656
01:01:28.971 --> 01:01:30.872
<i>of attack or have
already been compromised.</i>

657
01:01:30.906 --> 01:01:32.817
<i>And many have already been
hurt in the deadly bombing</i>

658
01:01:32.841 --> 01:01:34.276
<i>of the GW bridge.</i>

659
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:35.978
<i>As New Yorkers, we all know,</i>

660
01:01:36.011 --> 01:01:38.113
<i>if you see something,
say something.</i>

661
01:01:39.414 --> 01:01:40.749
You need to go home.

662
01:01:44.019 --> 01:01:45.254
What home?

663
01:01:47.055 --> 01:01:50.959
My parents left me,
my boyfriend left me.

664
01:01:51.927 --> 01:01:53.829
All I have left is my brother.

665
01:01:53.862 --> 01:01:57.899
<i>I just want to
say one more time to my wife.</i>

666
01:01:57.933 --> 01:02:01.536
<i>Hazel, I... I am not
sure if you're listening,</i>

667
01:02:01.571 --> 01:02:03.071
<i>I know the universe...</i>

668
01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:04.373
Katie.

669
01:02:04.406 --> 01:02:07.042
They left us
with only one choice.

670
01:02:15.284 --> 01:02:16.885
You don't understand.

671
01:02:18.453 --> 01:02:22.257
We've looked after
each other for our whole lives

672
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:24.493
and we promised
that we always would.

673
01:02:24.526 --> 01:02:25.827
And...

674
01:02:28.196 --> 01:02:30.065
<i>And finally, I'd like to make</i>

675
01:02:30.098 --> 01:02:31.376
<i>one last statement on
the air before signing off.</i>

676
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.168
<i>Before we face the end...</i>

677
01:02:33.201 --> 01:02:36.271
He said that
he found a place for us to...

678
01:02:36.305 --> 01:02:38.340
To get out of here, to survive.

679
01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:46.582
We're going to
get ourselves killed.

680
01:02:47.082 --> 01:02:48.817
I have nothing left.

681
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:52.454
I have to find him.

682
01:02:52.487 --> 01:02:54.557
<i>But there
is no mysterious enemy.</i>

683
01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:56.425
<i>There is only us.</i>

684
01:02:56.458 --> 01:02:58.360
<i>We are our own enemies.</i>

685
01:02:58.393 --> 01:03:00.062
<i>Go look through history.</i>

686
01:03:00.095 --> 01:03:01.597
<i>Look at the hinge
events and tell me,</i>

687
01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:03.865
<i>was this not our own doing?</i>

688
01:03:03.899 --> 01:03:06.134
<i>- When we had the opportunity,</i>
- Fuck.

689
01:03:06.168 --> 01:03:08.070
<i>What actions did we take?</i>

690
01:03:08.103 --> 01:03:10.640
<i>Or was it simply inaction?
And look where we are now.</i>

691
01:03:10.673 --> 01:03:14.443
<i>A direct result of our own
complacency, our indifference.</i>

692
01:03:15.645 --> 01:03:16.945
<i>What's going to happen tomorrow?</i>

693
01:03:16.978 --> 01:03:18.246
<i>I don't have that answer.</i>

694
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.615
<i>I don't think anyone does.</i>

695
01:03:20.082 --> 01:03:21.183
I had someone.

696
01:03:24.654 --> 01:03:26.589
I had someone too, once.

697
01:03:26.622 --> 01:03:28.523
<i>Building towards this</i>

698
01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:30.335
<i>and we have brought ourselves
into this very moment.</i>

699
01:03:30.359 --> 01:03:32.260
<i>All the choices that...</i>

700
01:03:32.294 --> 01:03:33.629
You know...

701
01:03:33.663 --> 01:03:35.263
<i>a very specific reason</i>

702
01:03:35.297 --> 01:03:37.232
<i>those decisions
led us directly here.</i>

703
01:03:37.265 --> 01:03:39.534
<i>At the end of the world,
as we've always done.</i>

704
01:03:39.569 --> 01:03:43.004
<i>And not one goddamn
thing you can do about it.</i>

705
01:03:43.038 --> 01:03:44.439
<i>We made this bed.</i>

706
01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:46.108
<i>Now we sleep in it.</i>

707
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:49.444
<i>But that leaves me
with one choice.</i>

708
01:03:49.478 --> 01:03:51.279
<i>One opportunity
to do the right thing.</i>

709
01:03:51.313 --> 01:03:53.482
<i>So Hazel, I am coming for you.</i>

710
01:03:53.515 --> 01:03:55.183
<i>I don't know where you are,</i>

711
01:03:55.217 --> 01:03:57.319
<i>but I got a couple
of ideas and I'm coming.</i>

712
01:03:57.352 --> 01:04:00.389
<i>I love you
more than life itself.</i>

713
01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:02.224
<i>So to all
my listeners out there,</i>

714
01:04:02.257 --> 01:04:04.202
<i>I want to thank you for
the many years of support.</i>

715
01:04:04.226 --> 01:04:06.596
<i>All I ever wanted in life
was to play the music I love</i>

716
01:04:06.629 --> 01:04:08.296
<i>for people who
wanted to hear it.</i>

717
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:09.699
<i>Stay strong, New York.</i>

718
01:04:09.732 --> 01:04:11.466
<i>Be brave, earthlings.</i>

719
01:04:12.568 --> 01:04:14.202
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

720
01:04:15.303 --> 01:04:17.607
<i>Steve Spears signing off.</i>

721
01:05:19.267 --> 01:05:21.303
These street's
are a death sentence.

722
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:49.397
Shh.

723
01:06:01.711 --> 01:06:03.245
Fuck!

724
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.620
We have to find
another place to go.

725
01:07:07.475 --> 01:07:08.611
Take it.

726
01:07:27.462 --> 01:07:28.698
We'll find him.

727
01:07:31.834 --> 01:07:33.268
We'll find him.

728
01:07:34.604 --> 01:07:38.306
Something beautiful
will come out of this mess.

729
01:07:50.385 --> 01:07:52.420
I can't believe
they took my fucking safe.

730
01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:53.889
The money is not good, anyway.

731
01:07:53.923 --> 01:07:56.826
It's not about
the motherfucking money, okay?

732
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.428
Shit.

733
01:08:05.701 --> 01:08:07.469
That pill you gave me.

734
01:08:07.502 --> 01:08:09.471
No, it will help
calm you down, all right?

735
01:08:10.906 --> 01:08:14.242
Look, Lulu said that
this guy is running for mayor.

736
01:08:14.275 --> 01:08:16.912
So, all we have
to do is figure out

737
01:08:16.946 --> 01:08:18.680
where his campaign
headquarters is

738
01:08:18.714 --> 01:08:20.950
and then we'll
go get some answers.

739
01:08:20.983 --> 01:08:23.283
I shouldn't have taken that.

740
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.688
Shit.

741
01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:40.435
Motherfucker.

742
01:08:42.571 --> 01:08:43.939
Hey, dude.

743
01:08:43.973 --> 01:08:45.573
I'm Ed.

744
01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:48.542
Yeah, I know.
We've met many, many times.

745
01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:51.412
Oh, dude.

746
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.448
Cam.

747
01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:54.617
- Cam.
- Yeah.

748
01:08:57.653 --> 01:08:59.187
Katie called me,
said she was here.

749
01:08:59.988 --> 01:09:01.456
- Were you followed?
- No.

750
01:09:02.524 --> 01:09:04.694
I went in and out
about four apartment buildings

751
01:09:04.727 --> 01:09:06.327
before I came to this place, so.

752
01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:10.231
- Oh.
- Hey, Katie.

753
01:09:10.265 --> 01:09:11.600
What happened to your friend,

754
01:09:11.634 --> 01:09:13.073
the guy who was
asleep in your house?

755
01:09:15.805 --> 01:09:16.872
He's dead?

756
01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:20.442
Nah, man, worse.

757
01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:23.578
He went back to Jersey.

758
01:09:31.453 --> 01:09:37.492
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

759
01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:39.595
Speaking of apartments,

760
01:09:39.627 --> 01:09:40.996
would have appreciated it

761
01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:42.598
if you guys
cleaned up after yourselves.

762
01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.667
There was blood all
over my bamboo flooring.

763
01:09:45.433 --> 01:09:48.604
Um, actually, Ed,
we were about to head out.

764
01:09:48.636 --> 01:09:50.371
Oh, you are?

765
01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.540
Let me tell you something, Sam.

766
01:09:52.575 --> 01:09:55.443
You would not believe the scene
on the bridge yesterday.

767
01:09:55.477 --> 01:09:57.278
The place was
packed with jumpers.

768
01:09:57.312 --> 01:09:58.647
I couldn't even get a taste.

769
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:00.448
You got a light?

770
01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:13.394
The truth is, Dan,
there is no goddamn control.

771
01:10:13.428 --> 01:10:15.263
At least not
in this fucking city.

772
01:10:17.499 --> 01:10:19.602
Can't even kill myself.

773
01:10:26.809 --> 01:10:28.476
I want out.

774
01:10:39.521 --> 01:10:40.790
Hey, where are you going?

775
01:10:49.397 --> 01:10:50.833
Fucking bummer, man.

776
01:11:33.976 --> 01:11:35.343
What do you want, little man?

777
01:11:37.713 --> 01:11:38.848
You got any beer?

778
01:11:39.447 --> 01:11:40.548
Draft or bottle?

779
01:11:41.717 --> 01:11:42.785
Are you pouring?

780
01:11:44.987 --> 01:11:47.656
- That's right.
- I'll take a bottle, thanks.

781
01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:00.703
Enjoy.

782
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:03.739
Cheers.

783
01:12:07.508 --> 01:12:09.377
You look lost, stranger.

784
01:12:10.579 --> 01:12:14.016
Uh. Oh, no, I'm just...

785
01:12:14.049 --> 01:12:16.451
I'm looking for
somebody who comes here a lot.

786
01:12:16.752 --> 01:12:18.386
Somebody who comes here.

787
01:12:19.889 --> 01:12:21.857
I'll come
anywhere you want, sugar.

788
01:12:22.758 --> 01:12:24.960
But it's going
to run you about 50 bucks.

789
01:12:29.565 --> 01:12:31.466
Oh. Mm-mm.

790
01:12:31.499 --> 01:12:34.502
No, no, dear God, no.

791
01:12:34.535 --> 01:12:37.673
Ma'am, I'm just
looking for a guy named Curry.

792
01:12:47.515 --> 01:12:48.751
Bothering my regulars?

793
01:12:48.784 --> 01:12:51.687
No, I'm just looking for Curry.

794
01:12:57.226 --> 01:12:58.928
What do you want with Mr. Curry?

795
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:02.497
He's got something
that belongs to me.

796
01:14:19.008 --> 01:14:21.010
I knew you'd come.

797
01:14:21.043 --> 01:14:22.945
Please, sit.

798
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:28.717
I need some answers.

799
01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:30.185
Answers to what?

800
01:14:31.253 --> 01:14:32.788
Where's Nick?

801
01:14:32.821 --> 01:14:34.189
Where did you take him?

802
01:14:34.223 --> 01:14:35.523
I need to know.

803
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:38.193
- Who?
- What do you mean, who?

804
01:14:39.261 --> 01:14:40.996
Nick.

805
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:42.765
Young, privileged white boy.

806
01:14:42.798 --> 01:14:45.167
Yesterday at his
apartment, uptown.

807
01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.908
Wait.

808
01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:55.677
I've seen you before, haven't I?

809
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:01.817
We should do
this again some time.

810
01:15:02.117 --> 01:15:03.585
This was fun.

811
01:15:09.158 --> 01:15:11.693
You got a lot of fucking
balls showing up here!

812
01:15:12.861 --> 01:15:14.296
You fucked up my friend!

813
01:15:16.165 --> 01:15:17.866
Give me one good reason why

814
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.302
I should not dismember
you right here, right now.

815
01:15:20.335 --> 01:15:22.004
I just want to talk to Curry.

816
01:15:22.304 --> 01:15:23.939
I want to know
what happened to Nick

817
01:15:23.972 --> 01:15:26.108
and I want
my motherfucking safe back.

818
01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:28.610
If I catch you snooping
around here one more time,

819
01:15:28.644 --> 01:15:31.380
I will not hesitate
to dismember you.

820
01:15:39.988 --> 01:15:41.390
<i>At the tone,</i>

821
01:15:41.423 --> 01:15:43.358
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

822
01:15:43.392 --> 01:15:45.094
<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

823
01:15:45.127 --> 01:15:47.863
<i>you may hang up or press
pound for more options.</i>

824
01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:50.833
Dad, it's Katie.

825
01:15:54.269 --> 01:15:56.405
I don't know
where you and Mom went

826
01:15:56.438 --> 01:15:58.273
or why we can't find you.

827
01:16:08.417 --> 01:16:09.718
But...

828
01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:13.689
if this is the end,

829
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:18.193
I just want you to
know that I hope it...

830
01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:28.003
If this is the end,
I hope it comes to you first.

831
01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:36.712
And if it's not, then...

832
01:16:42.317 --> 01:16:44.753
I hope I never
fucking see you again.

833
01:16:50.025 --> 01:16:51.393
Katie, it's me.

834
01:16:53.061 --> 01:16:54.830
Oh, my God, what happened?

835
01:16:55.898 --> 01:16:56.999
Where have you been?

836
01:16:58.867 --> 01:17:00.269
Cam, what the fuck?

837
01:17:00.302 --> 01:17:02.104
Where do you think?

838
01:17:02.137 --> 01:17:04.039
Why did you go without me?

839
01:17:04.072 --> 01:17:05.908
What is this about the safe?

840
01:17:05.941 --> 01:17:07.376
No.

841
01:17:07.409 --> 01:17:08.920
Okay, well, then what
the hell is it about?

842
01:17:08.944 --> 01:17:11.947
Look, I'm getting
out of this fucking city.

843
01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:14.750
Something I should
have done a long time ago.

844
01:17:14.783 --> 01:17:16.451
Oh, my God.

845
01:17:16.485 --> 01:17:19.688
But I stayed so that I could
risk my life looking for Nick.

846
01:17:20.756 --> 01:17:22.824
Nick is my brother,
he's all I have left.

847
01:17:22.858 --> 01:17:24.993
Katie, Nick is dead.

848
01:17:25.027 --> 01:17:26.762
Don't you get it?

849
01:17:26.795 --> 01:17:28.830
That's the only explanation.

850
01:17:28.864 --> 01:17:29.998
Did you see him?

851
01:17:30.032 --> 01:17:31.400
I didn't see shit.

852
01:17:31.433 --> 01:17:34.403
- Okay, so...
- Look, Ed, come on, man.

853
01:17:34.436 --> 01:17:36.281
You can't fucking stay here,
get your fucking lazy ass up.

854
01:17:36.305 --> 01:17:39.141
- Come on.
- Cam, if you didn't see him,

855
01:17:39.174 --> 01:17:41.476
then he might still be alive.
We can...

856
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:44.746
I don't even know
why I agreed to help you.

857
01:17:48.483 --> 01:17:49.918
Fuck you, Cam.

858
01:17:49.952 --> 01:17:51.486
Fuck me?

859
01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.088
Me?

860
01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:55.791
Fuck you, all right?

861
01:17:55.824 --> 01:17:57.426
Fuck you. Come on, Ed, let's go.

862
01:17:58.927 --> 01:18:00.262
Ed?

863
01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:02.364
Yo, Ed, my dude,
last call, let's go.

864
01:18:09.371 --> 01:18:14.977
<i>"Dear world, you are. Ed"</i>

865
01:18:24.253 --> 01:18:25.354
Oh, shit.

866
01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:28.357
He's dead.

867
01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:49.177
Hey, get out.

868
01:18:49.211 --> 01:18:51.411
Get out, you said you wanted
to leave, get the fuck out.

869
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.515
What?

870
01:18:53.548 --> 01:18:55.517
Everyone else is
giving up and now you,

871
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:56.952
you fucking junkie.

872
01:18:57.886 --> 01:18:59.855
God, I should have
expected it from the one guy

873
01:18:59.888 --> 01:19:03.559
who's given up on everyone
and everything in his life.

874
01:19:03.593 --> 01:19:05.294
You're fucking useless.

875
01:19:06.428 --> 01:19:07.996
No wonder that girl left you.

876
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:10.032
- It's not even like that.
- Oh, my God.

877
01:19:10.065 --> 01:19:13.969
Just take your shit
and get the fuck out, okay?

878
01:20:46.696 --> 01:20:48.096
<i>Who is this?</i>

879
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:49.431
<i>This Cam?</i>

880
01:20:51.032 --> 01:20:52.367
<i>We've got your girl, kid.</i>

881
01:20:54.436 --> 01:20:56.706
<i>It's in your best interest
to come here and pick her up.</i>

882
01:20:56.739 --> 01:20:58.273
<i>Quick.</i>

883
01:20:58.306 --> 01:21:00.008
<i>She's a pain in the fucking ass</i>

884
01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:01.543
<i>and if she doesn't shut up soon,</i>

885
01:21:01.577 --> 01:21:04.146
<i>I'm gonna twist her head
off and eat her organs.</i>

886
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.281
<i>You know where I am.</i>

887
01:21:20.763 --> 01:21:23.165
Well, I don't
fucking believe it.

888
01:21:24.567 --> 01:21:25.635
Where's the girl?

889
01:21:26.602 --> 01:21:28.303
Back for more?

890
01:21:28.336 --> 01:21:29.705
Okay.

891
01:21:35.177 --> 01:21:36.344
Fuck, man.

892
01:21:36.378 --> 01:21:37.680
Shit.

893
01:22:35.771 --> 01:22:37.740
I have to know
that my friends are safe.

894
01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:48.784
Nick's dead.

895
01:22:52.655 --> 01:22:54.189
I don't think
he even made it out

896
01:22:54.222 --> 01:22:55.591
of the apartment building.

897
01:22:56.525 --> 01:22:57.760
I think not.

898
01:22:58.828 --> 01:23:03.566
Took him out, threw him
down every single stair

899
01:23:03.599 --> 01:23:04.667
in that building.

900
01:23:27.122 --> 01:23:28.423
I need Katie back.

901
01:23:50.345 --> 01:23:51.446
You killed our guy.

902
01:23:59.789 --> 01:24:01.389
Why should I give her back?

903
01:24:04.359 --> 01:24:05.493
The big guy's friend?

904
01:24:07.462 --> 01:24:08.864
Died in his sleep last night.

905
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:16.639
She doesn't deserve this.

906
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:21.811
Maybe you're right.

907
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.881
Maybe she doesn't.

908
01:24:33.455 --> 01:24:34.890
I heard you're a photographer.

909
01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:37.525
- May I see?
- No.

910
01:24:42.698 --> 01:24:44.399
Heard you were headstrong, too.

911
01:24:45.768 --> 01:24:47.268
To a fault.

912
01:24:47.302 --> 01:24:48.403
See.

913
01:24:50.806 --> 01:24:54.342
I had a friend telling me
a couple of things about you.

914
01:24:56.311 --> 01:24:58.513
I heard that you
were a corrupt prick.

915
01:25:01.784 --> 01:25:02.852
Well now...

916
01:25:04.787 --> 01:25:06.622
That depends on who you ask.

917
01:25:10.358 --> 01:25:11.426
Where is she?

918
01:25:11.459 --> 01:25:12.595
Be patient, Cam.

919
01:25:14.529 --> 01:25:15.798
Right now, it's you and me.

920
01:25:20.903 --> 01:25:22.905
Oh. And my latest tenants.

921
01:25:26.909 --> 01:25:28.176
They're workers.

922
01:25:29.712 --> 01:25:31.246
They won't stop
until the very end.

923
01:25:35.017 --> 01:25:36.284
Respect that.

924
01:25:38.386 --> 01:25:41.857
You've been a real Thorn
in my side these past few days.

925
01:25:41.891 --> 01:25:43.859
We just wanted to get Nick back.

926
01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.361
Well, then.

927
01:26:16.726 --> 01:26:20.596
Lulu told me that
your girlfriend killed herself

928
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:21.797
right in front of you.

929
01:26:24.767 --> 01:26:26.001
She overdosed.

930
01:26:28.536 --> 01:26:29.705
Same shit.

931
01:26:30.873 --> 01:26:32.675
You were there.

932
01:26:35.077 --> 01:26:36.879
A junkie's death
is self-destruction,

933
01:26:36.912 --> 01:26:38.647
no matter how
you want to cut it.

934
01:26:41.316 --> 01:26:42.517
Hear that, little lady?

935
01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:50.726
Your friend here doesn't
have a real good reputation

936
01:26:52.027 --> 01:26:54.697
of keeping
the people around him safe,

937
01:26:54.730 --> 01:26:55.898
does he now?

938
01:27:00.636 --> 01:27:02.738
Wouldn't want these
to get out in public.

939
01:27:03.739 --> 01:27:05.674
Just because
civilization's going to end,

940
01:27:05.708 --> 01:27:07.643
it doesn't mean
that I'm going to.

941
01:27:09.612 --> 01:27:10.913
So, tell me, Cam.

942
01:27:13.381 --> 01:27:15.785
Give me one good
goddamn reason why you

943
01:27:15.818 --> 01:27:17.887
and that poor,
helpless little girl over there

944
01:27:18.687 --> 01:27:20.321
should walk out of here.

945
01:27:46.115 --> 01:27:47.415
Poor, helpless little girl.

946
01:27:47.448 --> 01:27:49.484
Give me one good goddamn reason

947
01:27:49.517 --> 01:27:50.920
why you should walk out of here.

948
01:28:01.997 --> 01:28:03.732
Give me back my safe.

949
01:28:05.601 --> 01:28:06.735
The money is mine, kid.

950
01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.939
I don't give
a fuck about the money.

951
01:28:13.075 --> 01:28:16.779
Give me back my safe.

952
01:28:23.652 --> 01:28:24.920
All right, then.

953
01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:28.557
I think that can be arranged.

954
01:28:33.028 --> 01:28:34.797
This is what you're looking for?

955
01:28:50.646 --> 01:28:51.714
Thank you.

956
01:28:55.516 --> 01:28:56.585
Come on, Katie.

957
01:28:57.987 --> 01:28:59.054
Let's go.
