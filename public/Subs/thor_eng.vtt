1
00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:29.779
How come they feed him
better than us?

2
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:44.894
Oh, look who's late
with my meal again.

3
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.577
Uh, Ivar.

4
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.946
Would you be a gentlemen
and get me more olives, please?

5
00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.350
It's my birthday, after all.

6
00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:13.923
Give out your hand.

7
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.193
All right, I'll bite.

8
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.767
I'm going for more wine.

9
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.921
So long, Ivar.

10
00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:49.326
Yes.

11
00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:50.994
Ivar? Ivar!

12
00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.970
You will never escape.

13
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.542
Odin and Thor will find you.

14
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.644
I've already escaped.

15
00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:10.974
Loki has escaped!
Search every room!

16
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.009
Search the castle!

17
00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:21.784
Loki!

18
00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:27.890
Stop this madness right now.

19
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.327
Midgard will fall.

20
00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:34.331
And I will replant this tree.

21
00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:37.501
When that happens,
you can either join me

22
00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:38.968
or you can be against me.

23
00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:40.638
But I assure you,
it will be too late,

24
00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:42.038
for I will have all the power.

25
00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:47.278
Only a fool would seek
a shattered world.

26
00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:51.848
There would be nothing left
for you to rule!

27
00:03:51.914 --> 00:03:54.884
I will not allow you

28
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:58.955
to fulfill
the destiny of Ragnarok.

29
00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.024
It was not the answer
I'd hoped for,

30
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.295
but if you get in the way,
so be it.

31
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:13.604
Your magic does not work...

32
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:16.473
in my throne room.

33
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.244
I don't need magic to defeat
your old, decrepit soul.

34
00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:26.550
Without your staff,
you are nothing!

35
00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:29.586
Loki, stop this now.

36
00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:32.556
What, are you afraid that
once I release the Great Wolf,

37
00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:35.092
that he will hunt you down
and fulfill his destiny

38
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.363
- by destroying you?
- There can still be peace.

39
00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:01.951
I took no pleasure
in your sentencing.

40
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:08.958
Yet there I was,
rotting away in that dungeon.

41
00:05:11.027 --> 00:05:15.065
I spent far too long idly by...

42
00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:16.933
mocked and ridiculed
by the people, our people,

43
00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.302
while you've sat there
in that throne room,

44
00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.437
doing nothing for our world.

45
00:05:21.572 --> 00:05:24.441
I can finish what I started
all those years ago!

46
00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:33.617
Surrender, Loki.
Surrender!

47
00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:35.586
Thor is on his way.

48
00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:38.522
And you have no escape.

49
00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:41.924
Surrender?

50
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:44.328
I am just getting
started, Odin.

51
00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:46.929
Aah!

52
00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.066
Thor!

53
00:05:56.407 --> 00:05:58.208
Ugh...

54
00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:01.944
Odin...

55
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:04.248
I warned you.

56
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:08.078
Father!

57
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.748
Father!

58
00:07:34.972 --> 00:07:37.006
Oh! No!

59
00:07:37.074 --> 00:07:39.610
Father.
Father!

60
00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:44.081
Rag... Ragnarok.

61
00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:46.048
Father, save your strength.

62
00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:48.685
- I'll get help.
- No, no.

63
00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:52.456
Loki... Loki is
going to Midgard...

64
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.626
to awaken Fenrir

65
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:59.329
and destroy
the tree of the Nine Realms

66
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:03.066
that will then regrow
in Loki's control!

67
00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:05.836
Fenrir...
Fenrir was imprisoned.

68
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:07.271
Never to be set free.

69
00:08:07.337 --> 00:08:09.573
The mortals,
they don't understand.

70
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.143
They don't understand what
they... they have released.

71
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.745
How do I stop it, Father?

72
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:16.480
You need to find...

73
00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:19.917
the other half
of the Vargr amulet.

74
00:08:19.983 --> 00:08:22.085
If the two halves
are put together,

75
00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:23.887
they could destroy
the Great Wolf.

76
00:08:23.954 --> 00:08:28.091
You must follow him.
You cannot let him succeed.

77
00:08:28.158 --> 00:08:29.560
Where do I find the amulet?

78
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:31.929
It was given
to a mortal king

79
00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:33.630
many years ago.

80
00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:39.135
Even I... do not know
where it resides.

81
00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:44.207
You need to find Fenrir's tomb!

82
00:08:45.642 --> 00:08:48.612
Father... Father?

83
00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:52.416
Father! Father!

84
00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:20.078
That's a 2.6.

85
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.112
What do you think,
Grace, 2.6.?

86
00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:23.747
Huh?

87
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:26.950
- That earthquake.
- What earthquake?

88
00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:29.186
Hand me the hilt.

89
00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:41.131
Why do you keep
looking at that?

90
00:09:41.198 --> 00:09:43.667
See this?

91
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.905
Yeah. Looks like a kite.

92
00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:50.707
You think indigenous
Native Americans are

93
00:09:50.774 --> 00:09:52.876
flying kites?
Is this some kind of

94
00:09:52.943 --> 00:09:55.512
sporting goods store
from 200 years ago?

95
00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.414
Can you at least pretend
you know petroglyphs?

96
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:00.851
Hey, you want a geologist?
I'm your guy.

97
00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:03.487
You want someone to do
a coffee run, still your guy.

98
00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:06.957
You want somebody to identify
indigenous symbols?

99
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:09.726
- Not your guy.
- Clearly.

100
00:10:09.793 --> 00:10:13.864
And besides, this isn't
indigenous Native Americans.

101
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.565
What is it?

102
00:10:15.632 --> 00:10:18.835
This is the symbol
of Fenrir, the Great Wolf.

103
00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:22.572
He was a god,
with the power to destroy Odin.

104
00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:26.576
Odin? Like Thor.
Like that Odin?

105
00:10:26.643 --> 00:10:27.844
Yep.

106
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:29.913
And legend has it
that Fenrir was so mean

107
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.816
and uncontrolled that he tried
to start the end of times.

108
00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:35.585
If he were to fulfill
his prophecy, then he would

109
00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:39.756
destroy the Nine Realms and
kill Odin and his wife, Frigg.

110
00:10:39.823 --> 00:10:41.725
What happened to Fenrir?

111
00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:43.727
They captured him
and imprisoned him

112
00:10:43.794 --> 00:10:45.996
for all eternity.

113
00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:47.764
Let's hope he doesn't escape.

114
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.735
Grace.

115
00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:54.504
Hey, Adrian. Grace here
just discovered Valhalla.

116
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.274
And the end of the world.
That's pretty cool, right?

117
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.709
Dr. Sagias wants us
to hold off.

118
00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.477
- Why?
- Well, he's worried

119
00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:02.245
that we're
experiencing foreshock

120
00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:04.948
leading up
to one big earthquake.

121
00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:08.885
No, he-- tell Dr. Sagias
you don't know if a foreshock

122
00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:11.588
is a foreshock unless
it's preceded by a bigger quake,

123
00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.725
and the main event may
not happen for months.

124
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:16.426
Look, let me just call him,
I'll talk to him...

125
00:11:16.493 --> 00:11:18.762
- No, it's more than that.
- What do you mean?

126
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:21.498
It's a cluster of quakes,
and they've been happening

127
00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:24.267
at the same time and apparently
around the whole world.

128
00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:26.303
No, you can't have
two quakes at once,

129
00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.371
let alone a cluster of them.

130
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.907
But let me get online,
and I'll check the USGS,

131
00:11:30.974 --> 00:11:33.577
and I'll look at their
seismographs, okay?

132
00:11:33.643 --> 00:11:35.213
Okay.

133
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.581
Adrian, look.

134
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:48.226
- Migration period?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.493
Vikings.

136
00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.861
I can see that.

137
00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:54.064
It's easily
over a thousand years old.

138
00:11:54.132 --> 00:11:55.832
Adrian, this is everything.

139
00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:58.368
We can prove that Vikings
traveled across North America

140
00:11:58.435 --> 00:11:59.503
all the way to California,

141
00:11:59.569 --> 00:12:01.072
way before anyone ever thought.

142
00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:02.305
It could be a plunder.

143
00:12:02.372 --> 00:12:04.708
You know,
a souvenir from battle.

144
00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:07.444
I mean, Vikings were already
in Newfoundland by this time.

145
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:10.514
That's fine.
But look closely at these rocks.

146
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.784
I see petroglyphs
of other symbols, all Norse.

147
00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.754
- This makes no sense.
- Adrian,

148
00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:21.424
this is a Viking tomb,
and we just have to get inside.

149
00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:26.730
There's no record of Vikings
making it this far west.

150
00:12:26.797 --> 00:12:27.964
I know!

151
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.201
This is like when...
Cope and Marsh

152
00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.568
discovered huge dinosaur bones

153
00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:33.403
in the United States
in the 1800s.

154
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.372
No one knew they could
make it this far.

155
00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:38.975
Sorry. I can't open it

156
00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.744
until we get the all clear.

157
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:42.813
We're so close.
We just have to open this tomb.

158
00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:44.881
I'll go inside, I'll see inside
for just a moment.

159
00:12:44.948 --> 00:12:47.050
I'll get a site survey
out here in a week.

160
00:12:47.118 --> 00:12:48.819
I can get it certified
in less than two weeks.

161
00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:50.353
Two weeks makes
no difference for a tomb

162
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.755
that's been here
for a thousand years.

163
00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:53.423
I'll get my team here
to secure the site

164
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.025
so Dr. Sagias is
more comfortable.

165
00:12:55.092 --> 00:12:58.061
Okay. And then we'll have
this turned around in a week.

166
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:06.903
Everyone okay?

167
00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:12.742
It opened by itself.

168
00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.647
Give me the rock saw.

169
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.317
I'm going to go get help.

170
00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.418
I'll talk to Dr. Sagias.

171
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.293
Hi. Yes, I need to speak
to Dr. Sagias now.

172
00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:30.694
It's Adrian at the site.

173
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.764
Flashlight?

174
00:13:36.967 --> 00:13:39.369
It's 30,000 lumens.

175
00:13:43.341 --> 00:13:45.809
- What's that beeping?
- That's me.

176
00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:47.878
Hydrogen levels are really high.

177
00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:49.012
Dangerous?

178
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.780
Probably happened
when the door opened.

179
00:13:50.847 --> 00:13:52.449
Yeah, when hydrogen
meets oxygen,

180
00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:54.584
it's pretty explosive.

181
00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:57.121
Yeah-- it also makes water.

182
00:13:58.455 --> 00:14:00.091
Yeah.

183
00:14:03.994 --> 00:14:07.131
Nick, you won't believe
what just happened.

184
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.941
Not much in here.

185
00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:19.876
Maybe we're not
the first to open it.

186
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:23.413
No. Viking tombs were not
like Egyptian tombs.

187
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.448
Very basic.

188
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.619
I'm surprised
it has petroglyphs.

189
00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:32.223
Must have been someone special.

190
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.191
Or something.

191
00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:40.164
I don't see a body.

192
00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:42.532
Vikings were usually cremated.

193
00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:44.968
So this isn't a tomb?

194
00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:46.503
I don't know.

195
00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:48.605
Could be a shrine.

196
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.542
What did the symbols say?

197
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:55.979
Sorry.

198
00:14:56.046 --> 00:14:58.215
Just talked to Dr. Sagias.
He doesn't want us in here.

199
00:14:58.282 --> 00:15:00.016
Come on. You gotta be
kidding me right now.

200
00:15:00.084 --> 00:15:01.451
He wants to send
a structural engineer

201
00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:03.520
out here
to make sure it's safe.

202
00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.224
Okay.

203
00:15:08.925 --> 00:15:10.660
Okay.

204
00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:13.964
Come on, Grace.

205
00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:17.834
Got it.

206
00:15:27.445 --> 00:15:29.546
Grace, come on.

207
00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:50.734
Definitely Norse.

208
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.535
I see more of the wolf
hieroglyphs.

209
00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:53.536
Fenrir?

210
00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:55.239
Yes, but...

211
00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.807
I see some
Native American symbols, too,

212
00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.543
like early.
Tongva symbols.

213
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.712
So, this tomb was
a joint venture

214
00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:05.515
between indigenous tribes
and the Vikings?

215
00:16:05.582 --> 00:16:07.817
Taking a guess, but...

216
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.487
maybe both groups built this

217
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:10.887
because they both
had a vested interest.

218
00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:12.922
In building a Viking tomb?

219
00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:15.058
Why would the Tongva
tribes do that?

220
00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:16.893
Respect?

221
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.561
Or fear.

222
00:16:18.628 --> 00:16:20.498
Look at these symbols.

223
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.632
That's a Valknut,
symbol of death.

224
00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:25.735
That's Yggdrasil,
tree of the Nine Realms.

225
00:16:25.802 --> 00:16:29.140
That's Tongva
for bad spirit, sun.

226
00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:31.342
Maybe it's not a tomb.

227
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:33.477
Maybe it's something else.

228
00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:35.413
Like what?

229
00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:37.614
Anything.

230
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.050
A passageway,
a room, a shrine.

231
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:41.651
A prison.

232
00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:43.220
For the wolf god

233
00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:46.357
that wants to eat the sun
and destroy the Nine Realms.

234
00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:48.092
Stop.

235
00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:53.330
Two cultures teaming together
to build a prison. Why?

236
00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:39.210
Whoa, whoa.
I don't think so.

237
00:17:39.276 --> 00:17:41.778
- Excuse me, sir.
- Do not touch me.

238
00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:45.116
This is a secure area.
We need to see some I.D.

239
00:17:45.182 --> 00:17:47.184
Some I.D.?

240
00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:49.752
What is I.D.?
Do you not know who I am?

241
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.155
Sir, you could
be Abraham Lincoln

242
00:17:51.222 --> 00:17:52.689
walking in here
with John Wilkes Booth.

243
00:17:52.755 --> 00:17:54.858
And I'd still need I.D.

244
00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:58.129
Clearly must be
some friends of yours.

245
00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:02.632
You're not in charge, are you?

246
00:18:02.699 --> 00:18:04.502
I.D.

247
00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:07.071
Enough with the I.D.

248
00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:09.440
Who's in charge?

249
00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:11.342
That'd be Dr. Nick Sagias,

250
00:18:11.408 --> 00:18:14.944
executive director
at the Odinkar Museum.

251
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.480
That guy.

252
00:18:16.547 --> 00:18:18.149
Dr. Sagias.

253
00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:19.716
Handsome fellow.

254
00:18:24.555 --> 00:18:26.055
May I go in?

255
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.362
- I need to call this in.
- No, you don't.

256
00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:35.199
No, I don't.

257
00:18:40.337 --> 00:18:41.871
Afternoon, Dr. Sagias.

258
00:18:43.607 --> 00:18:45.708
It's great to see you.

259
00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.611
Would you like me
to get the team

260
00:18:47.677 --> 00:18:49.712
and meet you at the site?

261
00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:51.748
Won't be necessary.

262
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.684
All right.

263
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:56.986
Sounds good.

264
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:28.885
Been in prison
far too long, my friend.

265
00:19:37.727 --> 00:19:39.796
I know what you're
going through.

266
00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:50.006
The wait is over.

267
00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:54.078
I can't believe I missed that.

268
00:19:54.144 --> 00:19:55.512
What?

269
00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:57.081
That's thulite.

270
00:19:57.147 --> 00:19:58.881
That's why it has
that pink tint to it.

271
00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.518
- Thulite?
- Yeah, it's Norwegian.

272
00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:03.420
These are huge rocks.

273
00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:05.089
What are they doing here?

274
00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:06.624
Would they travel
across the country

275
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.092
with tons of thulite?

276
00:20:08.158 --> 00:20:10.059
You can't find thulite
in California.

277
00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:12.529
Not a thousand years ago.
I mean, they found something

278
00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:14.531
similar at Searles Lake,
but deep.

279
00:20:14.598 --> 00:20:17.534
Really deep-- you'd need
19th century engineering

280
00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:20.337
- to extract it.
- Hey, Dr. Choi.

281
00:20:20.404 --> 00:20:22.339
Morning, Harold.

282
00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:23.973
Did Sagias say
he was coming in today?

283
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.510
No, I just spoke to him
on the phone. Why?

284
00:20:26.577 --> 00:20:28.811
I'm pretty sure he's here.

285
00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:30.913
- What?
- I think he's in the tomb.

286
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:35.286
Did you authorize
the explosives?

287
00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:38.355
- Why would I do that?
- Harold, call 911.

288
00:20:41.858 --> 00:20:43.960
Nick? Hello?

289
00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:46.497
Grace, I think
the room got bigger.

290
00:20:46.563 --> 00:20:47.765
Another door opened!

291
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.233
- Nick!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

292
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.669
- It's a lot of hydrogen!
- We should wait outside.

293
00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:53.504
Listen, my guess is
this time

294
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.806
there was a volatile
chemical reaction.

295
00:20:56.873 --> 00:20:58.676
Another door.
Who cares? Let's go!

296
00:20:58.742 --> 00:21:00.177
We're looking for Nick.

297
00:21:00.244 --> 00:21:02.146
No, this is a volatile site
that just exploded

298
00:21:02.212 --> 00:21:05.215
and possibly killed someone.
We need to go.

299
00:21:05.282 --> 00:21:07.117
- He could be hurt.
- Dr. Choi?

300
00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:08.985
First responders are
on their way,

301
00:21:09.052 --> 00:21:11.155
but they've got questions
because it's a dig site.

302
00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:14.057
Hello?

303
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:16.360
Patrick, let's go.

304
00:21:18.796 --> 00:21:20.798
Patrick!

305
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.232
Patrick...

306
00:21:33.243 --> 00:21:34.745
Patrick!

307
00:21:34.812 --> 00:21:35.945
- Patrick!
- Adrian.

308
00:21:36.012 --> 00:21:37.247
Patrick, let's go.

309
00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:39.015
Wait, wait,
that's Dr. Sagias.

310
00:21:40.617 --> 00:21:41.552
Oh my God.

311
00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:42.885
Nick?

312
00:21:42.952 --> 00:21:45.422
Don't touch me.

313
00:21:45.489 --> 00:21:47.491
It's okay, Dr. Sagias.

314
00:21:47.558 --> 00:21:48.958
You're at the dig site.

315
00:21:49.025 --> 00:21:50.728
There was an explosion.

316
00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:53.831
Nick, it's me,
Adrian Quinn.

317
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:55.132
Are you... Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

318
00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:56.966
I don't want your help, okay?

319
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.171
They found him.

320
00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:03.940
Yeah, he's just
a little stunned.

321
00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:05.275
All right, everybody,
it's not safe here.

322
00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:06.810
We got to get everybody out.

323
00:22:06.876 --> 00:22:08.345
Sir? Dr. Sagias,

324
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:10.714
I'm going to lead you
to the surface, all right?

325
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:13.250
Stay away from me.
All of you!

326
00:22:13.317 --> 00:22:17.087
Nick.
It's me, Grace.

327
00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:23.527
I do not require
your assistance at this time.

328
00:22:23.594 --> 00:22:25.462
Why are you here, Nick?

329
00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:28.898
I came...

330
00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:31.235
to visit the prison
of Fenrir myself.

331
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.539
How did you know this was
the prison of Fenrir?

332
00:22:37.074 --> 00:22:38.275
We need to go outside.

333
00:22:38.342 --> 00:22:40.344
This room is too unstable.

334
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:41.978
We need to leave.

335
00:22:42.044 --> 00:22:45.649
That's fine.
I'll go with Patrick here.

336
00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:48.352
You all leave.

337
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.422
Okay.

338
00:22:51.488 --> 00:22:55.459
- You got him?
- I'm fine, fine, just-- yeah.

339
00:23:08.572 --> 00:23:10.541
Uh-uh.

340
00:23:12.342 --> 00:23:13.911
Did Nick seem off to you?

341
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:16.847
No one said anything about him
showing up to the site.

342
00:23:16.914 --> 00:23:18.148
He's like that.

343
00:23:18.215 --> 00:23:20.016
Yeah, but you
just talked to him.

344
00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.752
I talked to him on the phone.

345
00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:24.020
He could have been
on his way to the site.

346
00:23:24.087 --> 00:23:26.055
Right.

347
00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:28.192
Look, Nick is eccentric.

348
00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:31.495
Could have been stunned
from the blast.

349
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.400
Did you notice he's not limping?
He always has a cane.

350
00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:39.001
I mean, we should have heard him
or at least seen him.

351
00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:40.904
How'd he sneak past us?

352
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.474
I'm gonna make a few calls.
I'm not sure what's going on,

353
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.543
- but it doesn't feel right.
- I'm going to go back.

354
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.445
What?

355
00:23:50.314 --> 00:23:52.749
I was just wondering
if you were worth saving.

356
00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:54.485
Excuse me?

357
00:23:54.551 --> 00:23:58.054
I thought you wanted me to help
you out of here, Dr. Sagias.

358
00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:00.824
Then help.

359
00:24:03.727 --> 00:24:04.994
You reached security,
this is Greg.

360
00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:05.995
How can I help you?

361
00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:07.531
Yes. Hi, I'm Grace Choi.

362
00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:09.166
I'm one of the archeologists
working with Sagias.

363
00:24:09.233 --> 00:24:10.701
I was wondering
if I could speak with him.

364
00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:13.704
I'm afraid that Dr. Sagias
is in a meeting.

365
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.972
You have to call back later.

366
00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:16.507
He's in a meeting?

367
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:19.409
Did he go to the site?

368
00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:23.012
No, I just buzzed in his lunch
about 10 minutes ago.

369
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.482
He's been at
the museum all day.

370
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:28.519
- Okay. Thanks.
- Of course.

371
00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:30.687
Is there anything else
I can help with?

372
00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:32.689
Is there anything wrong?

373
00:24:32.756 --> 00:24:34.625
Could you have him
call me when he's done?

374
00:24:34.691 --> 00:24:36.226
Tell him it's important.

375
00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:38.595
Certainly. I'll have him
call you back at once.

376
00:24:38.662 --> 00:24:40.097
Thanks, Greg.

377
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:44.801
- Harold.
- Yeah?

378
00:24:44.868 --> 00:24:46.103
Toss me your radio.

379
00:24:50.307 --> 00:24:53.577
Patrick?
Quinn?

380
00:24:53.644 --> 00:24:55.546
Come in, over?

381
00:24:58.882 --> 00:25:00.817
Can anyone hear me, over?

382
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.523
Come on.
Follow me.

383
00:25:23.073 --> 00:25:25.776
What is all this?

384
00:25:25.842 --> 00:25:28.312
A sentry station.

385
00:25:31.848 --> 00:25:35.252
Guards?
For what?

386
00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:43.226
Fenrir.

387
00:25:45.963 --> 00:25:47.164
Nick!

388
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.167
- Nick, stop!
- At last.

389
00:25:50.233 --> 00:25:51.802
Stop.

390
00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:55.073
I'm sorry, but there are
procedures for stuff like this.

391
00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:56.573
I'm sorry?

392
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.709
You can't just take things
from an excavation site.

393
00:25:58.775 --> 00:26:00.344
We have to log it.

394
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.713
But more importantly,
we have to get out of here now.

395
00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:05.115
Dr. Sagias...

396
00:26:05.182 --> 00:26:08.051
Open the urn.

397
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:11.121
- Nick!
- Now. Open the urn.

398
00:26:16.493 --> 00:26:18.862
Patrick.
Patrick, stop!

399
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:37.347
I can't breathe.

400
00:26:59.103 --> 00:27:01.371
Much better.
Thank you, Doctor.

401
00:27:01.438 --> 00:27:03.573
Without your assistance,
I would've never

402
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.411
been able to retrieve
the Great Wolf's fang.

403
00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:12.116
You can't remove that.

404
00:27:12.182 --> 00:27:13.917
I don't understand.

405
00:27:13.984 --> 00:27:15.519
Who are you?

406
00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:18.622
Where are my manners?

407
00:27:18.689 --> 00:27:20.757
Why, I'm Loki.

408
00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:25.328
Get away from him.

409
00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:27.197
That's not Nick.

410
00:27:27.264 --> 00:27:28.532
That's the guy!

411
00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:29.933
That's the guy
that got past me.

412
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.435
What do you want?

413
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:35.106
What's rightfully mine,
of course.

414
00:27:35.173 --> 00:27:37.108
He's controlling
Patrick somehow.

415
00:27:37.175 --> 00:27:38.208
Grace,
we got to get out of here.

416
00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:39.943
What have you done to Patrick?

417
00:27:43.914 --> 00:27:45.649
Well, unfortunately,
Odin made it

418
00:27:45.716 --> 00:27:50.387
so that a God is unable
to unearth the Great Wolf.

419
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:54.725
So I needed a mortal,

420
00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:59.163
and the good doctor here
was willing and able.

421
00:27:59.229 --> 00:28:01.498
And now that I have the fang...

422
00:28:03.266 --> 00:28:07.270
there's just
one more thing to do.

423
00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:11.041
Patrick!

424
00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:14.478
- No!
- Get out of here! Go!

425
00:28:14.544 --> 00:28:18.381
Save yourself!
Go! Ah!

426
00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:20.450
You heard him,
save yourself.

427
00:28:20.517 --> 00:28:23.420
- Go!
- Save yourselves! Go!

428
00:28:39.137 --> 00:28:41.271
Ah!

429
00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:43.974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

430
00:28:52.183 --> 00:28:55.318
There he is.

431
00:29:01.525 --> 00:29:03.927
I was wondering
when you'd show up, Thor.

432
00:29:03.994 --> 00:29:05.529
Looks like you were
not as good

433
00:29:05.595 --> 00:29:07.697
at hiding your whereabouts
as you think.

434
00:29:07.764 --> 00:29:10.300
You will pay for your crimes
against Asgard.

435
00:29:10.367 --> 00:29:13.436
Crimes? What crimes?

436
00:29:13.503 --> 00:29:16.740
Liberating this planet?
Freeing the mortals.

437
00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:19.342
I believe you're the one
committing the crime, Thor.

438
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:47.205
I'm afraid it's too late,
for Fenrir is awake.

439
00:30:03.321 --> 00:30:05.289
The end of the world is near.

440
00:30:05.355 --> 00:30:07.158
I must run.

441
00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:09.526
No. No! Loki!

442
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:14.764
Loki!

443
00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:20.704
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

444
00:30:25.343 --> 00:30:27.278
Wait, Grace!

445
00:30:27.345 --> 00:30:29.113
Wait, wait.

446
00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:43.927
Excuse me.

447
00:30:45.028 --> 00:30:46.696
Hi, uh...

448
00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:51.269
I'm, uh... Grace.

449
00:30:51.335 --> 00:30:53.304
I'm Dr. Grace Choi.

450
00:30:53.371 --> 00:30:56.506
I'm site manager
at this excavation.

451
00:30:56.573 --> 00:30:59.243
Um, uh-uh.

452
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.179
That's Loki, so...

453
00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:06.016
You must be Thor.

454
00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:07.984
You know of my name?

455
00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.355
How?

456
00:31:11.421 --> 00:31:14.658
Well... the hammer.

457
00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:17.527
Mjolnir?

458
00:31:17.594 --> 00:31:19.562
You know of it?

459
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:21.932
Norse mythology is
my specialty.

460
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.435
Well...

461
00:31:25.502 --> 00:31:27.171
Not mythology, I guess.

462
00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:30.874
You studied us.

463
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:32.909
Then you may know
where Loki is.

464
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.245
You can help me.

465
00:31:34.312 --> 00:31:36.880
Um, maybe?

466
00:31:38.682 --> 00:31:41.718
The fate of your world
depends upon it

467
00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:43.887
and your knowledge of us.

468
00:31:44.754 --> 00:31:47.158
Well, when you put it like that.

469
00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:51.461
Come with me.

470
00:31:53.463 --> 00:31:54.965
Okay.

471
00:32:07.078 --> 00:32:09.679
The Fang of Fenrir.
Do not touch that.

472
00:32:09.746 --> 00:32:12.582
Wait, what happened to
the markings on your face?

473
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:14.684
War paint of the gods.

474
00:32:14.751 --> 00:32:16.820
It manifests during battle.

475
00:32:21.459 --> 00:32:23.526
Wait-- hey!

476
00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:45.648
That's Yggdrasil,
the tree of the Nine Realms.

477
00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:46.916
You know of it?

478
00:32:46.983 --> 00:32:48.319
Yeah.

479
00:32:48.386 --> 00:32:51.255
Basically each branch holds
a part of the universe.

480
00:32:51.322 --> 00:32:52.490
Earth is part of it.

481
00:32:52.555 --> 00:32:55.493
This is what Loki is after.

482
00:32:55.558 --> 00:32:57.328
He seeks to destroy the tree

483
00:32:57.395 --> 00:33:00.730
and plant a new one
that he could control.

484
00:33:00.797 --> 00:33:02.932
And that's why he needs Fenrir?

485
00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:05.869
Loki can destroy the tree.

486
00:33:07.238 --> 00:33:10.141
But attacking each realm,
that will be difficult.

487
00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:13.477
Fenrir will grow
stronger and bigger,

488
00:33:13.543 --> 00:33:15.413
and he will devour each realm.

489
00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:17.881
Where's the tree?

490
00:33:17.947 --> 00:33:20.317
My father said it's nearby.

491
00:33:20.384 --> 00:33:24.221
Fenrir was imprisoned
when he got too close to it.

492
00:33:24.288 --> 00:33:28.658
The gods stopped Fenrir.
We are just mortals.

493
00:33:28.725 --> 00:33:31.462
No one is asking you to do this.

494
00:33:31.529 --> 00:33:33.297
I will take on this
challenge myself.

495
00:33:33.364 --> 00:33:35.132
No, we can't let Patrick die.

496
00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:36.699
Your friend is right.

497
00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:38.902
Fenrir grows more powerful

498
00:33:38.968 --> 00:33:40.670
and your friend,
he will disappear forever.

499
00:33:40.737 --> 00:33:42.073
We can stop them.

500
00:33:44.508 --> 00:33:46.444
This is what I like
about your kind.

501
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.777
The odds are against you.

502
00:33:47.844 --> 00:33:49.779
Yet you choose to fight
for one another.

503
00:33:49.846 --> 00:33:53.117
- Can we fight them?
- No.

504
00:33:53.184 --> 00:33:56.387
Just tell me where they are
and I will fight them on my own.

505
00:33:56.454 --> 00:34:00.091
No. You want my help,
that I'm going with you.

506
00:34:00.157 --> 00:34:01.758
Me, too.

507
00:34:03.461 --> 00:34:06.696
Stubborn, foolish.

508
00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:08.831
But full of heart.

509
00:34:08.898 --> 00:34:11.268
Fine.
We will travel together.

510
00:34:11.335 --> 00:34:13.070
So where are we going?

511
00:34:13.137 --> 00:34:17.607
Loki has awakened Fenrir
with the Vargr amulet.

512
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.079
But he only has one half.

513
00:34:22.146 --> 00:34:26.616
If we find the other half
before he realizes his mistake,

514
00:34:26.683 --> 00:34:28.585
we have a chance
of stopping Fenrir

515
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.286
from devouring the tree.

516
00:34:30.353 --> 00:34:32.722
So we have to locate
the other half of the amulet.

517
00:34:32.789 --> 00:34:34.324
Indeed.

518
00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:39.597
- Sagias.
- Yes.

519
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:42.600
- What is this?
- Not a what, who.

520
00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:44.368
Doctor Nicholas Sagias.

521
00:34:44.435 --> 00:34:47.438
If anyone knows where to locate
the second half of the amulet,

522
00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:48.606
he does.

523
00:34:56.846 --> 00:34:58.215
That is Fenrir.

524
00:34:58.282 --> 00:34:59.682
He grows more powerful
by the moment.

525
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.018
If we do not stop Loki,

526
00:35:02.086 --> 00:35:04.921
Fenrir will be unstoppable.

527
00:35:04.988 --> 00:35:08.024
This hammer is amazing.

528
00:35:10.628 --> 00:35:12.896
No one can wield Mjolnir...

529
00:35:14.565 --> 00:35:16.367
unless they are worthy.

530
00:35:18.435 --> 00:35:19.903
Of course.

531
00:35:30.481 --> 00:35:32.550
This is the most impressive
form of transportation.

532
00:35:32.616 --> 00:35:35.152
Have you been able to reach
Dr. Sagias at all?

533
00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:36.920
Mm-mm.

534
00:35:36.986 --> 00:35:40.191
Our knowledge
of you mortals is flawed.

535
00:35:41.691 --> 00:35:43.826
What do you mean?

536
00:35:43.893 --> 00:35:45.596
Well, the last time
our paths crossed,

537
00:35:45.663 --> 00:35:48.064
you had swords and ships.

538
00:35:49.366 --> 00:35:51.402
When was the last time
you were on Earth, exactly?

539
00:35:51.468 --> 00:35:53.637
Long before your time.

540
00:35:53.703 --> 00:35:55.239
We humans have come a long way.

541
00:36:02.946 --> 00:36:05.014
Another quake?

542
00:36:05.082 --> 00:36:06.116
Hold on.

543
00:36:10.053 --> 00:36:11.854
Hold on!

544
00:36:14.425 --> 00:36:16.627
- What are you doing?
- We have to get to Nick.

545
00:36:16.694 --> 00:36:19.129
I'm gonna drive right through.
We don't have another choice.

546
00:36:31.408 --> 00:36:33.577
Oh, fantastic.

547
00:36:33.644 --> 00:36:36.113
You would have made
a most formidable Valkyrie.

548
00:36:38.014 --> 00:36:39.916
I'll take that as a compliment.

549
00:36:39.983 --> 00:36:42.852
Please, don't do that again.

550
00:36:47.157 --> 00:36:51.861
Yes! Again, again, again.
Let's go! Yes.

551
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.005
Hello?
It's Grace Choi!

552
00:37:02.072 --> 00:37:04.108
Quinn,
try and reach Nick again.

553
00:37:04.174 --> 00:37:05.509
Okay.

554
00:37:06.744 --> 00:37:09.346
Step aside.
I will open this door.

555
00:37:16.654 --> 00:37:18.054
Sorry. Adrian?

556
00:37:18.122 --> 00:37:20.391
Sagias is just waiting
for you. Come on in.

557
00:37:21.558 --> 00:37:22.892
So, is this a cosplay thing?

558
00:37:22.959 --> 00:37:25.262
- What?
- The guy in the costume.

559
00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:26.330
No.

560
00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:29.899
I'm Thor of Asgard,
Son of Odin.

561
00:37:29.966 --> 00:37:33.237
Of course you are.
Dr. Sagias?

562
00:37:33.304 --> 00:37:35.072
Oh, hey.

563
00:37:36.307 --> 00:37:41.911
So is this... Thor,
our Norse god?

564
00:37:41.978 --> 00:37:44.315
The one and only.

565
00:37:44.381 --> 00:37:46.816
- I know it sounds...
- No, no, no.

566
00:38:08.905 --> 00:38:11.642
The end of days.

567
00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:18.248
Ragnarok.

568
00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:20.551
And?

569
00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:26.989
So, he knows the...
the ancient tongue.

570
00:38:27.056 --> 00:38:30.427
That doesn't... that doesn't
mean anything to me.

571
00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:36.999
Okay.

572
00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:38.769
So he's Thor. Got it.

573
00:38:38.836 --> 00:38:40.604
We are wasting time.

574
00:38:40.671 --> 00:38:42.706
Do you know where the other half
of the amulet is?

575
00:38:42.773 --> 00:38:48.145
I assume Patrick is the human
host for Fenrir the Wolf?

576
00:38:48.212 --> 00:38:51.013
- How did you...
- Well, he's not here.

577
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:54.284
You would have said something
if... if he died.

578
00:38:54.351 --> 00:38:58.054
Right? Because Fenrir needs
a human host. Correct?

579
00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:09.065
They are becoming
more frequent.

580
00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:10.868
Fenrir grows more powerful.

581
00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:12.669
As I said
on the phone in the van,

582
00:39:12.736 --> 00:39:15.938
this is why we need the second
piece of the amulet of Vargr.

583
00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:17.608
The full amulet is
the only thing

584
00:39:17.674 --> 00:39:18.975
that can stop Fenrir

585
00:39:19.041 --> 00:39:20.511
and prevent Loki
from destroying the world.

586
00:39:29.653 --> 00:39:31.020
So you know what it is?

587
00:39:36.993 --> 00:39:38.995
Come with me.

588
00:39:50.874 --> 00:39:53.510
That is a burial boat.

589
00:39:53.577 --> 00:39:55.044
Not meant for battle?

590
00:39:57.414 --> 00:39:59.583
Meant for travel to Valhalla.

591
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:04.954
You should not have taken this
from their tomb.

592
00:40:06.423 --> 00:40:10.194
We study it.
Learn from it.

593
00:40:14.498 --> 00:40:17.967
You have cursed yourselves
by disturbing the dead.

594
00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:24.441
What are those statues?

595
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:32.583
- Jormungandr.
- The World Serpent.

596
00:40:32.649 --> 00:40:35.385
We almost lost them
in the quake earlier.

597
00:40:35.452 --> 00:40:37.654
We secured them as
you guys arrived.

598
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:40.958
Those are one of the crown
jewels of the exhibit.

599
00:40:41.023 --> 00:40:44.495
Jormungandr is
a child of Loki.

600
00:40:47.664 --> 00:40:51.235
Why do you have
this cursed thing here?

601
00:40:51.301 --> 00:40:53.637
- Thor!
- Whoa, whoa!

602
00:40:53.704 --> 00:40:54.838
They must be destroyed.

603
00:40:54.905 --> 00:40:56.340
Wait!

604
00:40:56.406 --> 00:40:58.609
Very rare and extremely
valuable, this stuff.

605
00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:03.580
We're here for the amulet.

606
00:41:03.647 --> 00:41:05.449
Let's just get it to you
so we can leave.

607
00:41:06.483 --> 00:41:07.551
Great.

608
00:41:32.543 --> 00:41:33.977
Come, Fenrir.

609
00:41:34.043 --> 00:41:35.512
Soon.

610
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.148
Soon, my child.

611
00:41:50.894 --> 00:41:53.096
Right here.

612
00:41:54.798 --> 00:41:56.333
The amulet.

613
00:42:02.606 --> 00:42:04.174
Beautiful.

614
00:42:05.676 --> 00:42:09.846
When we put these halves
together, we will stop Fenrir.

615
00:42:09.913 --> 00:42:11.481
Now, how do we find Loki?

616
00:42:15.919 --> 00:42:17.387
Oh, my God.

617
00:42:17.454 --> 00:42:20.090
I have to go home.
I have to find my boyfriend.

618
00:42:20.157 --> 00:42:22.292
Is this even possible?

619
00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:25.028
Australia and New Zealand.

620
00:42:25.095 --> 00:42:26.697
The tsunami is heading here.

621
00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:29.967
The earth will quake.

622
00:42:30.033 --> 00:42:31.835
Floods will come.

623
00:42:31.902 --> 00:42:33.503
The end is near.

624
00:42:34.338 --> 00:42:36.473
We need to get
to higher elevation.

625
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.376
- I have to go, I have to--
- Hey, hey,

626
00:42:39.443 --> 00:42:41.079
you need to stay with us.

627
00:42:41.144 --> 00:42:43.947
We'll leave together.

628
00:42:44.014 --> 00:42:46.717
It may be too late.

629
00:42:46.783 --> 00:42:48.685
Ragnarok has begun.

630
00:42:53.023 --> 00:42:54.224
Fenrir.

631
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:55.792
Why do you hurt?

632
00:42:55.859 --> 00:42:58.695
I don't understand,
you... you should not feel pain.

633
00:42:58.762 --> 00:43:00.430
You can't.

634
00:43:02.733 --> 00:43:04.301
What am I missing?

635
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.006
What is happening?

636
00:43:09.073 --> 00:43:10.207
What is happening?

637
00:43:10.273 --> 00:43:12.342
Loki...

638
00:43:12.409 --> 00:43:15.612
You've made
a grave mistake, my son.

639
00:43:15.679 --> 00:43:17.314
Odin.

640
00:43:17.381 --> 00:43:19.282
- Odin, you are dead.
- Am I?

641
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:20.484
You are dead, you are no more!

642
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:24.187
And you are in Asgard.

643
00:43:27.824 --> 00:43:29.593
No, no, no.

644
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.262
Just more of your tricks.

645
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:33.797
I killed you.

646
00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:36.333
And yet...

647
00:43:39.236 --> 00:43:43.473
You stand before me.

648
00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:51.815
No, no, it's--
it's just an illusion.

649
00:43:51.882 --> 00:43:56.887
Maybe my time in Valhalla
was not yet.

650
00:43:59.923 --> 00:44:01.291
Maybe you're scared.

651
00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:05.529
You're scared,
that's why you came back.

652
00:44:05.595 --> 00:44:06.897
No.

653
00:44:06.963 --> 00:44:09.133
I came back to warn you

654
00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:11.668
to stop this foolishness.

655
00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:17.274
This trick of yours
will backfire.

656
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:23.346
The prophecy has been foretold.

657
00:44:24.548 --> 00:44:26.150
I will start the end of days.

658
00:44:26.216 --> 00:44:29.753
You will be dead before you find

659
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.522
the other half
of the amulet.

660
00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:37.861
The other half?

661
00:44:37.928 --> 00:44:40.764
You would have figured
this out eventually.

662
00:44:42.265 --> 00:44:44.534
But I have a deal for you.

663
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:47.971
Stop this right now

664
00:44:48.038 --> 00:44:54.044
and come... sit beside me.

665
00:44:54.112 --> 00:44:57.447
And we shall rule together.

666
00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:02.018
Together?

667
00:45:06.923 --> 00:45:08.625
You must think I'm mad.

668
00:45:11.928 --> 00:45:13.764
No.

669
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.365
The end of days has
been foretold.

670
00:45:15.432 --> 00:45:17.768
I will win.

671
00:45:17.834 --> 00:45:19.736
I will destroy
the Nine Realms,

672
00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:23.974
and Fenrir will hunt you down
in the halls of Asgard

673
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.410
and eat your heart out--
oh, glorious Odin!

674
00:45:35.186 --> 00:45:38.355
Odin! Odin!

675
00:45:40.191 --> 00:45:41.525
No!

676
00:46:03.114 --> 00:46:05.448
Odin... Odin.

677
00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:09.619
Come, Fenrir.

678
00:46:09.686 --> 00:46:12.223
We must find the other
half of the amulet.

679
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.323
Now.

680
00:46:20.964 --> 00:46:22.399
Grab whatever you can.

681
00:46:28.206 --> 00:46:29.439
We have to go.

682
00:46:29.506 --> 00:46:30.807
I know.

683
00:46:34.377 --> 00:46:38.381
We should wait here.
Loki is coming.

684
00:46:38.448 --> 00:46:40.050
We have 15 minutes before

685
00:46:40.117 --> 00:46:42.519
this whole building
will be underwater.

686
00:46:42.586 --> 00:46:43.520
Please just grab
what you can

687
00:46:43.587 --> 00:46:44.688
and let's get in my car.

688
00:46:44.754 --> 00:46:46.356
Loki is coming here.

689
00:46:46.423 --> 00:46:49.025
No offense,
but you are immortal.

690
00:46:49.093 --> 00:46:50.094
We are not.

691
00:46:50.161 --> 00:46:51.895
We need to leave.

692
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:57.601
You have something
that belongs to me.

693
00:46:57.667 --> 00:47:00.137
You are playing
a dangerous game, Loki.

694
00:47:01.938 --> 00:47:03.740
- We need to leave.
- Let's go.

695
00:47:03.807 --> 00:47:05.475
Give me the amulet,
and I promise

696
00:47:05.542 --> 00:47:08.279
your deaths will be
quick and painless.

697
00:47:37.308 --> 00:47:39.409
Stop this madness, Loki.

698
00:47:42.213 --> 00:47:44.248
Never.

699
00:47:50.087 --> 00:47:51.821
What are those things?

700
00:47:51.888 --> 00:47:53.690
Looks like Loki's
let out his children.

701
00:47:53.757 --> 00:47:55.259
They're blocking the exits.

702
00:47:55.326 --> 00:47:57.460
We gotta get out of here,
or we're going to die here.

703
00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:01.498
Wait.

704
00:48:01.564 --> 00:48:03.800
What are you doing? Wait!

705
00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:09.773
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

706
00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:10.840
These aren't
going to do anything

707
00:48:10.907 --> 00:48:12.442
against those animated sentries.

708
00:48:12.509 --> 00:48:14.678
I don't think
we have any other choice.

709
00:48:22.286 --> 00:48:24.020
The amulet.

710
00:48:55.885 --> 00:48:56.953
No!

711
00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.555
Loki!

712
00:49:32.622 --> 00:49:34.125
Where did Loki go?

713
00:49:34.191 --> 00:49:37.428
He fled and he possesses
both halves of the amulet.

714
00:49:37.495 --> 00:49:39.263
Fenrir will be unstoppable now.

715
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.630
I'm sorry, Nick.

716
00:49:40.697 --> 00:49:41.898
We have to go.

717
00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:43.867
The tsunami
will be here any minute.

718
00:49:43.933 --> 00:49:45.568
If we stay here,
we're going to die.

719
00:49:45.635 --> 00:49:48.205
We'll figure out another way
as we get to higher elevation.

720
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:36.686
This is not your time
to enter Valhalla.

721
00:50:48.165 --> 00:50:49.699
Adrian!

722
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.043
I could not save her.

723
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:09.186
Nick.

724
00:51:29.939 --> 00:51:33.210
We lost her.
We lost her, we lost Adrian.

725
00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:35.745
We-- We lost Adrian.
We lost Greg.

726
00:51:35.812 --> 00:51:37.548
And we lost the amulet.

727
00:51:37.615 --> 00:51:39.517
It's okay.

728
00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:42.253
- We lost everything.
- I... can't get them back.

729
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:57.368
If we can still
find the amulet...

730
00:51:59.236 --> 00:52:01.305
can you save us?

731
00:52:01.372 --> 00:52:02.972
Is it too late?

732
00:52:04.108 --> 00:52:08.412
It is never too late
to give up hope.

733
00:52:08.479 --> 00:52:11.814
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

734
00:52:11.881 --> 00:52:13.651
I can't do this.

735
00:52:13.716 --> 00:52:15.352
I can't.

736
00:52:15.419 --> 00:52:17.053
Can't bring them back.

737
00:52:18.688 --> 00:52:19.923
Okay?

738
00:52:23.494 --> 00:52:25.929
Odin, father.

739
00:52:27.464 --> 00:52:28.831
Bring your daughter home.

740
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.137
She waits for the final journey.

741
00:52:35.206 --> 00:52:38.642
Has she earned her place...

742
00:52:38.708 --> 00:52:41.811
Or in darkness to roam.

743
00:52:54.791 --> 00:52:56.160
She's gone.

744
00:52:57.561 --> 00:52:58.795
Okay?

745
00:53:00.029 --> 00:53:03.733
- I'm here.
- Do you think we can stop him?

746
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:10.107
Humans... have endured
a lot of suffering

747
00:53:10.174 --> 00:53:13.743
and almost extinction
but we survived.

748
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:20.184
Plagues, famine,
drought, everything.

749
00:53:22.051 --> 00:53:25.489
But you know what?
We survived.

750
00:53:25.556 --> 00:53:28.791
And we will survive this, too.

751
00:53:28.858 --> 00:53:30.261
You have got to hold on--

752
00:53:30.327 --> 00:53:34.864
we have got to make
something of all of this.

753
00:53:37.635 --> 00:53:39.136
Absolutely.

754
00:53:40.204 --> 00:53:41.938
Good.

755
00:53:47.578 --> 00:53:50.414
Nick, we need to
find the laptop.

756
00:53:50.481 --> 00:53:51.881
I know.

757
00:53:52.882 --> 00:53:53.850
Did you find it?

758
00:53:53.916 --> 00:53:56.819
No. Something better.

759
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:01.458
It's a Valknut.

760
00:54:01.525 --> 00:54:03.193
The symbol of Odin.

761
00:54:05.696 --> 00:54:09.199
Your star.
It's a catalyst.

762
00:54:09.266 --> 00:54:12.202
It can open a portal
for communication.

763
00:54:16.005 --> 00:54:18.742
What about up here?
With connection, power.

764
00:54:18.808 --> 00:54:21.010
Things like that.

765
00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.727
Father.
Father!

766
00:54:36.794 --> 00:54:40.631
I thought surely that
Loki had taken you from us.

767
00:54:40.698 --> 00:54:43.267
My death was not to be.

768
00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:47.638
Mighty Odin.

769
00:54:47.705 --> 00:54:50.507
You can come. You can come
to Earth and help us.

770
00:54:50.574 --> 00:54:53.777
- We need you.
- I can't. I'm too weak.

771
00:54:53.843 --> 00:54:56.313
I'm amazed at this connection.

772
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.183
There should be no connection
between the Realms

773
00:54:59.249 --> 00:55:00.818
with me in this shape.

774
00:55:00.883 --> 00:55:03.120
Yes, well, the mortals,

775
00:55:03.187 --> 00:55:05.756
they have
the Valknut relic now.

776
00:55:05.823 --> 00:55:09.892
A relic from a--
a time long forgotten.

777
00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:12.162
Yes, yes indeed.

778
00:55:13.364 --> 00:55:15.599
And Loki?

779
00:55:15.666 --> 00:55:17.568
What of him?

780
00:55:17.634 --> 00:55:20.036
Fenrir has awakened.

781
00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:22.506
And Loki has both
halves of the amulet.

782
00:55:22.573 --> 00:55:27.411
Earthquakes are-- are shaking
this planet to its core.

783
00:55:27.478 --> 00:55:31.013
And the flooding is
wreaking havoc everywhere.

784
00:55:33.817 --> 00:55:39.423
Has Loki approached
the tree of the Nine Realms?

785
00:55:42.925 --> 00:55:45.129
I'm not sure.

786
00:55:51.435 --> 00:55:53.237
Then time is not
on your side, my son.

787
00:55:53.303 --> 00:55:56.407
You must kill the beast
before it gets strong enough

788
00:55:56.473 --> 00:55:59.510
to devour the realms
straight from the tree.

789
00:55:59.576 --> 00:56:01.712
I fear this is too much
to ask of them.

790
00:56:01.779 --> 00:56:06.350
- Them?
- Yes. Mortals.

791
00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:09.253
Morals have been
accompanying me in this,

792
00:56:09.319 --> 00:56:14.124
and they've been valiant
in their efforts to help.

793
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.396
Help is good.

794
00:56:20.764 --> 00:56:24.768
Listen, if you cannot
reclaim the amulet,

795
00:56:24.835 --> 00:56:26.904
there is only one other way

796
00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:31.442
you can destroy Fenrir.

797
00:56:33.343 --> 00:56:39.048
That which can create
may also destroy.

798
00:56:40.117 --> 00:56:44.354
Father... the connection
is weakening.

799
00:56:44.421 --> 00:56:47.925
Do you know, where is Loki,
where is he?

800
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:53.996
The Valknut is not strong enough
to keep the connection.

801
00:56:54.063 --> 00:56:56.667
Where, Father?
Where are they?

802
00:56:56.733 --> 00:56:59.603
Loki is... with Fenrir

803
00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:04.040
in Vigrid,
the fields of battle.

804
00:57:04.107 --> 00:57:09.446
There exists a bridge
between worlds.

805
00:57:09.513 --> 00:57:11.715
It's...

806
00:57:11.782 --> 00:57:12.916
it's a cave.

807
00:57:12.982 --> 00:57:17.019
There you will find Yggdrasil.

808
00:57:17.087 --> 00:57:18.589
Father...

809
00:57:20.457 --> 00:57:21.925
Father!

810
00:57:21.991 --> 00:57:23.961
Father, please don't go!

811
00:57:24.026 --> 00:57:25.696
We need you.
I need you.

812
00:57:25.762 --> 00:57:26.930
Father, please!

813
00:57:26.996 --> 00:57:28.565
Please, Father!

814
00:57:30.467 --> 00:57:33.437
My father...
he's alive.

815
00:57:33.504 --> 00:57:35.572
- My father's alive!
- That's good, right?

816
00:57:35.639 --> 00:57:38.609
Yes, yes. Yes.
There's still hope.

817
00:57:38.675 --> 00:57:42.779
If we can find Loki and Fenrir,
and defeat them.

818
00:57:42.846 --> 00:57:44.281
So he's sending help?

819
00:57:44.348 --> 00:57:47.217
No. He's far too weak for that.

820
00:57:47.284 --> 00:57:49.051
He must regain
his strength first.

821
00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:50.988
We can't wait.

822
00:57:51.053 --> 00:57:52.890
We have a plan.

823
00:57:52.956 --> 00:57:55.158
I will find Loki.

824
00:57:55.225 --> 00:57:57.227
Where is he?
Did your father tell you?

825
00:57:57.294 --> 00:57:59.162
Yes.
Yes, he did.

826
00:57:59.229 --> 00:58:01.832
He's near Fenrir's tomb.
There's a cave.

827
00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:05.502
Yes, I know,
where we did our site survey.

828
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:08.037
It's a few miles east
of the dig and the sequoias.

829
00:58:08.105 --> 00:58:10.841
It's by Boyden Cavern.
It's very deep.

830
00:58:16.346 --> 00:58:18.382
This structure
is going to collapse.

831
00:58:18.448 --> 00:58:20.484
You'll survive.
We won't.

832
00:58:20.551 --> 00:58:22.051
We have to get off the roof.

833
00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:23.887
I understand that.

834
00:58:23.954 --> 00:58:25.756
But Main Street is

835
00:58:25.822 --> 00:58:28.057
under the Pacific Ocean
right now.

836
00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:29.927
This is our safest place,
right here.

837
00:58:29.993 --> 00:58:31.295
I will go find Loki,

838
00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:32.896
and I will come back
for you two.

839
00:58:32.963 --> 00:58:34.531
Maybe I can get
one of the...

840
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:37.534
benefactor's helicopters,
but even if I can get one,

841
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:39.903
it'll have to be far enough
away from this water.

842
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:43.340
Wait. Of course.

843
00:58:43.407 --> 00:58:45.242
- What?
- Your idea.

844
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:47.511
- What idea?
- The water.

845
00:58:47.578 --> 00:58:51.281
The water.
I can't swim with this leg.

846
00:58:51.348 --> 00:58:53.650
Who said anything
about swimming?

847
00:59:09.099 --> 00:59:11.101
Do you have a question?

848
00:59:11.168 --> 00:59:12.636
Thousands.

849
00:59:14.938 --> 00:59:16.540
Why did you leave Earth?

850
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:20.544
I never left Earth.

851
00:59:22.346 --> 00:59:23.647
I just was not needed.

852
00:59:25.816 --> 00:59:27.150
But you're needed now.

853
00:59:28.185 --> 00:59:29.753
To protect the Nine Realms.

854
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:31.154
Yes.

855
00:59:34.524 --> 00:59:37.227
Why does saving us
mean so much to you?

856
00:59:38.629 --> 00:59:42.165
Your world is
a part of the Nine Realms.

857
00:59:42.232 --> 00:59:44.701
And I am the protector
of the Nine Realms.

858
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:53.477
My grandfather...

859
00:59:53.543 --> 00:59:56.013
he created this world.

860
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.349
He gave his life for it.

861
00:59:59.416 --> 01:00:01.652
His flesh and blood.

862
01:00:01.718 --> 01:00:03.553
Made the mountains and the sea.

863
01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:08.325
My father Odin...

864
01:00:08.392 --> 01:00:10.160
He was the caretaker.

865
01:00:11.595 --> 01:00:14.498
And this is where I met
my beloved Sif.

866
01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:18.669
Ahh, the golden haired goddess.

867
01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:25.709
Where is she now?

868
01:00:25.776 --> 01:00:27.277
Asgard...

869
01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:28.712
with my father.

870
01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:36.219
Wait. You see that?

871
01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:40.857
There, see?

872
01:00:44.128 --> 01:00:46.196
The Ravens.

873
01:00:46.263 --> 01:00:49.167
Huginn, Muninn.

874
01:00:49.232 --> 01:00:50.400
Odin's messengers.

875
01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:51.968
They only answer to him.

876
01:00:52.035 --> 01:00:54.371
He said he would try
to send help if he could.

877
01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:56.840
We need to follow them.

878
01:00:56.907 --> 01:00:58.241
Are you sure?

879
01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:02.012
I'm certain.
He must know where Loki is.

880
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.947
Is he sending any more help?

881
01:01:04.014 --> 01:01:06.249
I think we're going to need
all the help we can get.

882
01:01:06.316 --> 01:01:07.751
I do not know.

883
01:01:07.818 --> 01:01:10.554
Sending his ravens
may have spent

884
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.889
what little power he has left,

885
01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:16.226
but he knows how valuable
this world is.

886
01:01:17.227 --> 01:01:19.496
It cannot fall.

887
01:01:19.563 --> 01:01:21.631
We need to dock the ship
and start climbing.

888
01:01:21.698 --> 01:01:24.868
We may get more waves
with this tsunami.

889
01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:26.436
What choice do we have?

890
01:01:30.307 --> 01:01:31.942
You okay, Nick?

891
01:01:32.008 --> 01:01:33.477
I'm good.
Let's keep going.

892
01:01:38.182 --> 01:01:40.851
What's Asgard like?

893
01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:42.786
Much like this world.

894
01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:46.723
It's a wonderful thing.

895
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.993
Your planet is beautiful
and spectacular.

896
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.230
Yet Loki wants to destroy it.

897
01:01:52.295 --> 01:01:56.333
Loki does not see Earth
the way I see it.

898
01:01:56.399 --> 01:02:00.971
He sees Earth
as power and control.

899
01:02:01.037 --> 01:02:04.142
In the stories I was told
Loki was a trickster,

900
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:07.978
a rabble rouser, not someone
who wanted to destroy the realm.

901
01:02:08.044 --> 01:02:10.847
He seeks to control
the realms, but in reality,

902
01:02:10.914 --> 01:02:14.985
he just wants a playground
for his dark fantasies.

903
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:19.723
Loki's not happy unless he is
tricking or deceiving everyone.

904
01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:21.391
He will not be happy
when he realizes

905
01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:24.128
he's only fooling himself.

906
01:02:24.195 --> 01:02:25.629
Let's hope he never gets there.

907
01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:28.765
Unfortunately,
it is pre-ordained.

908
01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:32.170
Fenrir will grow,
and he will devour the tree.

909
01:02:32.236 --> 01:02:35.072
Loki will kill my father, Odin.

910
01:02:35.139 --> 01:02:36.606
I thought you said that--

911
01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:39.442
He is destined
for these things.

912
01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:44.815
But you're here.
You're here to stop it, right?

913
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:46.483
Yes.

914
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:49.120
But you said it was preordained.

915
01:02:49.187 --> 01:02:51.888
Loki wins.

916
01:02:51.955 --> 01:02:54.457
Every story has a writer.

917
01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:57.761
Every story has
a predestiny.

918
01:02:57.828 --> 01:03:00.664
But not every writer
is the same.

919
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.499
Not every story
is the same.

920
01:03:02.566 --> 01:03:04.101
So there's a chance

921
01:03:04.168 --> 01:03:06.436
Loki's story doesn't end
the way he wants it to.

922
01:03:07.404 --> 01:03:08.805
Now you are getting it.

923
01:03:10.407 --> 01:03:13.577
- Okay, Doctor?
- Fine.

924
01:03:13.643 --> 01:03:16.746
- We can come back for you.
- No.

925
01:03:16.813 --> 01:03:18.682
I'm okay.

926
01:03:18.748 --> 01:03:20.750
You can get on my back.

927
01:03:20.817 --> 01:03:23.620
Uh, no, I'm okay.
Thanks.

928
01:03:23.687 --> 01:03:26.456
Nonsense, come on.

929
01:03:26.523 --> 01:03:29.426
Okay.
Here we go. Yeah.

930
01:03:29.492 --> 01:03:32.129
All right.
Thor is carrying me.

931
01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:35.498
That's what we're doing.

932
01:03:40.271 --> 01:03:41.872
Oh, yep.

933
01:03:44.007 --> 01:03:46.042
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome, friend.

934
01:03:49.213 --> 01:03:50.914
The Ravens.

935
01:03:50.981 --> 01:03:52.883
They're saying
Loki is this way.

936
01:03:55.518 --> 01:03:57.255
I don't see another entrance.

937
01:03:57.321 --> 01:03:58.555
Is there another way in?

938
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.626
Let me speak to you
for a minute.

939
01:04:02.692 --> 01:04:05.462
- Really? Now, here?
- Yeah, yeah. Right now.

940
01:04:05.528 --> 01:04:07.397
We're out of our league here.

941
01:04:07.464 --> 01:04:08.932
We're going to help.

942
01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:11.668
We're playing with the gods,
and their games.

943
01:04:11.735 --> 01:04:12.969
We're just mortals.

944
01:04:13.036 --> 01:04:15.672
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

945
01:04:15.739 --> 01:04:17.874
Loki's dangerous
enough on his own.

946
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:22.079
But Fenrir, this wolf,
it's a whole 'nother thing.

947
01:04:22.146 --> 01:04:23.680
We have Thor.

948
01:04:25.283 --> 01:04:29.353
Ragnarok. It's the end
of the world as we know it.

949
01:04:29.419 --> 01:04:31.888
- It's not 100%.
- Close enough.

950
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:35.159
That's enough for me
to try-- hey.

951
01:04:35.226 --> 01:04:37.727
As my old mentor
used to tell me,

952
01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:39.496
we have to make this matter.

953
01:04:42.499 --> 01:04:43.900
Wait.

954
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.469
Loki's in there.
I can sense it.

955
01:04:46.536 --> 01:04:48.438
Move away.

956
01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:03.954
Stay with me.
I can see the way.

957
01:05:19.602 --> 01:05:21.205
There's no shame.

958
01:05:21.272 --> 01:05:22.639
You've gotten this far.

959
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.675
No.

960
01:05:25.742 --> 01:05:28.545
No, let's go kick some
Norse god's ass, shall we?

961
01:05:30.081 --> 01:05:31.614
Come on.

962
01:06:02.979 --> 01:06:04.981
It's the Tree of Nine Realms.

963
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.422
The Tree of Nine Realms
is very powerful.

964
01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:15.058
Loki will need all his magic
and tricks to destroy it.

965
01:06:15.126 --> 01:06:17.761
And once he destroys it?

966
01:06:17.827 --> 01:06:19.629
He will plant a new one.

967
01:06:19.696 --> 01:06:21.365
One that he can control.

968
01:06:21.432 --> 01:06:24.768
And then he will control
all the realms in the universe.

969
01:06:25.835 --> 01:06:27.138
How do we stop this?

970
01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.575
You don't.

971
01:06:34.412 --> 01:06:36.046
You're too late.

972
01:06:36.113 --> 01:06:38.581
Fenrir, kill them!

973
01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:40.884
Go, now!

974
01:06:42.286 --> 01:06:43.586
Come on, Thor.

975
01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:07.211
Nick?

976
01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:08.945
Come on.

977
01:07:09.012 --> 01:07:10.381
Nick!

978
01:07:10.448 --> 01:07:12.283
Back here.

979
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:13.284
Are you okay?

980
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.585
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

981
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:18.822
Do you see Thor?

982
01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:21.691
No.

983
01:07:23.494 --> 01:07:25.929
Grace...

984
01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:28.064
You know he's a god, don't you?

985
01:07:28.132 --> 01:07:29.732
Who can get hurt.

986
01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:31.601
We have to find him.

987
01:07:35.038 --> 01:07:37.841
The rocks are loose.
I think we have a way out.

988
01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:40.277
- We have to hurry.
- Okay, let's go.

989
01:08:04.868 --> 01:08:07.036
Oh, that wound
looks nasty, Thor.

990
01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:08.771
I hope it doesn't hurt too much.

991
01:08:09.873 --> 01:08:12.742
I do not need my lightning.

992
01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:14.878
I can defeat you
with my hammer.

993
01:08:16.412 --> 01:08:17.981
Fenrir!

994
01:08:47.478 --> 01:08:49.912
Feel my power, Thor!

995
01:08:58.522 --> 01:09:00.124
Enough is enough.

996
01:09:06.596 --> 01:09:08.465
There you are.

997
01:09:08.532 --> 01:09:10.201
Thor!

998
01:09:20.144 --> 01:09:22.078
Nick, we have
to do something.

999
01:09:32.755 --> 01:09:35.192
Enough with
this nonsense, mortals.

1000
01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:37.094
You cannot win!

1001
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:38.962
It's over.

1002
01:09:39.028 --> 01:09:41.064
I have the complete amulet.

1003
01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:44.268
Control of the Nine Realms
and the Great Wolf

1004
01:09:44.335 --> 01:09:45.902
is mine once again.

1005
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:51.808
If you don't mind,
I have a tree to plant.

1006
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:08.092
Thor, my son.

1007
01:10:08.158 --> 01:10:09.859
Awake.

1008
01:10:12.463 --> 01:10:13.564
Where am I?

1009
01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:15.499
Where is this place?

1010
01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:20.437
You don't recognize your home?

1011
01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:25.842
My home?

1012
01:10:27.211 --> 01:10:28.911
My home.

1013
01:10:30.281 --> 01:10:32.849
This is one of many
possibilities.

1014
01:10:32.915 --> 01:10:36.186
But only one can be real.

1015
01:10:36.253 --> 01:10:40.790
And that is up to you,
and what you decide.

1016
01:10:48.565 --> 01:10:50.534
They are unstoppable, Father.

1017
01:10:54.271 --> 01:11:00.810
Father, what more can I do
that I've not already done?

1018
01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:06.949
The floods.

1019
01:11:07.016 --> 01:11:10.621
The floods have nearly
consumed the earth.

1020
01:11:10.688 --> 01:11:13.457
And the tree is almost dead
because of my failure.

1021
01:11:13.524 --> 01:11:18.095
They may be near,
but the earth is not lost.

1022
01:11:19.496 --> 01:11:23.833
Why do you consider defeat
when the Earthlings fight on?

1023
01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:27.970
They may have their problems,

1024
01:11:28.037 --> 01:11:32.543
but when they're
faced with death,

1025
01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:35.412
they rush in head on.

1026
01:11:35.479 --> 01:11:40.484
They will die for
the right cause without worry.

1027
01:11:41.418 --> 01:11:43.920
We could learn a lot from them.

1028
01:11:43.986 --> 01:11:47.558
You are Thor of Asgard.

1029
01:11:48.525 --> 01:11:51.662
Son of Odin.

1030
01:11:51.729 --> 01:11:55.265
A great, great warrior.

1031
01:11:55.332 --> 01:12:02.106
Thunder and lightning
beckon at your call.

1032
01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:08.812
My power no longer
answers to me.

1033
01:12:08.878 --> 01:12:11.248
Your power has not
left you, my son,

1034
01:12:11.315 --> 01:12:16.253
it has just been corrupted
by Fenrir's bite.

1035
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.923
I am not strong
enough without it.

1036
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.261
You don't need to defeat Loki.

1037
01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:29.333
Ragnarok lies
down with the Beast.

1038
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.301
It always has.

1039
01:12:31.368 --> 01:12:35.572
That beast has no weakness!

1040
01:12:35.639 --> 01:12:39.343
Everything has
a weakness, my son.

1041
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:43.946
I would not have entrusted
you with this task

1042
01:12:44.013 --> 01:12:48.050
if I did not think
that you could do it.

1043
01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:52.689
Remember who you are.

1044
01:12:52.756 --> 01:12:55.592
And remember what you have.

1045
01:12:56.794 --> 01:13:00.731
I cannot do this without
your strength, Father.

1046
01:13:00.798 --> 01:13:02.499
It is impossible.

1047
01:13:02.566 --> 01:13:05.636
My strength has

1048
01:13:05.702 --> 01:13:09.506
and always will be with you.

1049
01:13:09.573 --> 01:13:13.210
Wait, Father, please.
Please don't go, Father.

1050
01:13:13.277 --> 01:13:16.079
Please wait, Father.

1051
01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:18.081
It's all right, my son.

1052
01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:21.218
You only have a short way to go.

1053
01:13:21.285 --> 01:13:23.854
The earth needs you.

1054
01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:27.291
Your friends,
they need you.

1055
01:13:27.357 --> 01:13:32.129
They fight on,
but they cannot defeat Loki.

1056
01:13:32.196 --> 01:13:38.067
They need Thor,
the God of Thunder.

1057
01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:24.147
Thor, stop this!

1058
01:14:24.214 --> 01:14:25.782
Accept defeat.

1059
01:14:25.849 --> 01:14:27.317
Never.

1060
01:14:27.384 --> 01:14:30.254
Then I will make it
a quick and painless death.

1061
01:14:32.054 --> 01:14:34.157
Fenrir, destroy him!

1062
01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:37.427
Thor, the fang!

1063
01:14:51.508 --> 01:14:52.643
Patrick!

1064
01:15:05.789 --> 01:15:08.225
You have killed Fenrir.

1065
01:15:09.192 --> 01:15:11.662
You have killed my wolf!

1066
01:15:15.465 --> 01:15:19.102
The earth still stands, brother.

1067
01:15:19.169 --> 01:15:20.571
You have not won.

1068
01:15:20.637 --> 01:15:22.306
You still mock me!

1069
01:15:26.376 --> 01:15:30.047
I may have lost the realms,
but I will have vengeance.

1070
01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:34.017
I will kill you
once and for all.

1071
01:15:34.084 --> 01:15:36.453
You couldn't kill Odin.

1072
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.355
Brother, you will not kill me.

1073
01:15:38.422 --> 01:15:41.391
Odin is gone.
Odin is dead.

1074
01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.328
Odin is but an illusion!

1075
01:15:47.364 --> 01:15:49.499
Oh, stupid brother.

1076
01:15:49.566 --> 01:15:51.868
How do you think
we found this place?

1077
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:58.809
Even weakened,
Odin has managed to defeat you.

1078
01:16:03.447 --> 01:16:07.351
Even with your planning,
and your power...

1079
01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:10.787
- Careful.
- And you have failed.

1080
01:16:12.422 --> 01:16:15.892
Because that's
your destiny, brother.

1081
01:16:18.795 --> 01:16:21.331
You will always fail!

1082
01:16:21.398 --> 01:16:25.502
As long as there is
someone to oppose you.

1083
01:16:28.238 --> 01:16:29.906
No.

1084
01:16:29.973 --> 01:16:31.908
No, no!

1085
01:16:46.456 --> 01:16:49.893
Earth will never fall
to the likes of you.

1086
01:17:01.672 --> 01:17:03.173
How?

1087
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.676
You are but a mortal!

1088
01:17:07.044 --> 01:17:09.212
How?

1089
01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:16.420
Surrender and I will
spare your life, brother.

1090
01:17:16.486 --> 01:17:19.623
- Spare me?
- Yes.

1091
01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:24.494
Spare me, oh brother.
Spare me this nonsense.

1092
01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:27.597
Please stop,
brother, please.

1093
01:17:27.664 --> 01:17:28.932
So what?

1094
01:17:28.999 --> 01:17:31.201
I can rot in that prison

1095
01:17:31.268 --> 01:17:33.670
for your worthless father?

1096
01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:36.940
Stop. Stop.

1097
01:17:37.007 --> 01:17:39.443
No, never again. Never!

1098
01:17:39.509 --> 01:17:42.146
- No!
- This ends here, brother!

1099
01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:44.448
No!

1100
01:17:49.019 --> 01:17:50.987
Loki!

1101
01:17:52.289 --> 01:17:54.192
Brother!

1102
01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:11.475
Grace.

1103
01:18:13.810 --> 01:18:15.512
Grace-- Grace.

1104
01:18:17.748 --> 01:18:19.449
Is it over?

1105
01:18:21.085 --> 01:18:22.853
Is Loki...

1106
01:18:22.919 --> 01:18:25.288
Loki is dead.

1107
01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:27.225
It is over.

1108
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:29.493
Come, let's go.

1109
01:18:30.327 --> 01:18:33.730
That hammer of yours,
it's pretty heavy.

1110
01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:37.300
You are a true warrior, Grace.

1111
01:18:37.367 --> 01:18:39.770
Only the worthy can
wield Mjolnir.

1112
01:18:42.405 --> 01:18:44.708
Nick.

1113
01:18:44.775 --> 01:18:46.643
Nick!

1114
01:18:50.714 --> 01:18:52.516
It's over.

1115
01:18:52.582 --> 01:18:54.551
We stopped Ragnarok.

1116
01:18:55.852 --> 01:18:57.320
So what now?

1117
01:19:11.635 --> 01:19:13.970
I thought you killed Fenrir.

1118
01:19:14.037 --> 01:19:15.639
He should be dead!

1119
01:19:16.873 --> 01:19:18.276
Patrick.

1120
01:19:18.341 --> 01:19:20.043
Grace!

1121
01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:24.347
Are you okay?

1122
01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:26.416
We need to
get him out of here.

1123
01:19:26.483 --> 01:19:27.984
He needs a doctor.

1124
01:19:29.253 --> 01:19:30.787
Oh, good to see you.

1125
01:19:33.557 --> 01:19:35.992
Is Earth okay?

1126
01:19:36.059 --> 01:19:37.794
It is.

1127
01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:39.629
At least for now.

1128
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.701
That's a good sign.

1129
01:19:46.237 --> 01:19:47.971
A good sign indeed.

1130
01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.676
They call me home to Asgard.

1131
01:19:52.742 --> 01:19:54.711
Will we see you again?

1132
01:19:56.513 --> 01:19:58.949
If you need me, I will return.

1133
01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:01.785
Your world is
under my protection.

1134
01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:04.721
Did you mean what you said?

1135
01:20:04.788 --> 01:20:07.691
About Adrian and Greg
in Valhalla?

1136
01:20:07.757 --> 01:20:13.063
Yes. Your friends will be
celebrated amongst the gods.

1137
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:14.898
You have my word.

1138
01:20:14.965 --> 01:20:16.933
Still a mess.

1139
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.870
A lot of lives were
lost here today.

1140
01:20:23.074 --> 01:20:24.741
Yes, there were.

1141
01:20:24.808 --> 01:20:26.776
I'm sorry for your losses.

1142
01:20:28.312 --> 01:20:30.580
Thank you, my friend.

1143
01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:33.416
Thank you, all of you.

1144
01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:36.486
You're so brave.

1145
01:20:39.257 --> 01:20:41.259
It is time.

1146
01:20:41.325 --> 01:20:43.460
Stand back.

1147
01:20:48.064 --> 01:20:50.066
Okay.

1148
01:20:50.134 --> 01:20:52.169
So I met a god today.

1149
01:20:52.236 --> 01:20:54.037
That's above my pay grade.

1150
01:20:54.105 --> 01:20:56.173
Man, that guy's awesome.

1151
01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:03.147
Yeah, he is.

1152
01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.535
Thor!

1153
01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:50.161
Father.

1154
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:04.841
Rise, my son. Rise.

1155
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.745
And what of your brother, Loki?

1156
01:22:11.514 --> 01:22:13.217
Father, he is...

1157
01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:14.684
he is dead.

1158
01:22:16.187 --> 01:22:18.122
He left me no choice.

1159
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:20.424
He would not yield.

1160
01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:22.159
If I had not stopped him,

1161
01:22:22.226 --> 01:22:24.527
he would have destroyed
the Nine Realms.

1162
01:22:27.431 --> 01:22:28.798
I should have known.

1163
01:22:30.234 --> 01:22:31.668
He was a fool.

1164
01:22:33.104 --> 01:22:36.773
But he was my brother,
and I loved him dearly.

1165
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.842
Still...

1166
01:22:38.908 --> 01:22:41.544
you did something good.

1167
01:22:41.611 --> 01:22:44.848
The earthlings are
a resilient people.

1168
01:22:44.914 --> 01:22:47.851
In times of crisis,
they come together

1169
01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:50.287
to help their fellow man.

1170
01:22:50.354 --> 01:22:54.358
Thanks to you,
they have a chance to rebuild.

1171
01:22:54.425 --> 01:22:57.694
The earthlings and Asgard

1172
01:22:57.761 --> 01:23:00.930
will forever be in your debt.

1173
01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:05.635
Oh, Father, I...

1174
01:23:05.702 --> 01:23:07.971
I did not have the heart
to tell the mortals

1175
01:23:08.038 --> 01:23:11.975
that... Fenrir still lives
in this amulet.

1176
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:16.113
His soul forever.

1177
01:23:26.556 --> 01:23:31.162
All of this was prophesized,

1178
01:23:31.228 --> 01:23:33.663
and the end was

1179
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:38.635
because of
all of our decisions.

1180
01:23:41.505 --> 01:23:43.140
Come.

1181
01:23:44.442 --> 01:23:45.975
Rejoice!

1182
01:23:46.042 --> 01:23:51.415
Rejoice,
for the Nine Realms...

1183
01:23:51.482 --> 01:23:54.318
are at peace once again.

1184
01:23:54.385 --> 01:23:57.020
Thor!

1185
01:23:57.088 --> 01:23:58.289
To Asgard!

1186
01:23:58.355 --> 01:24:00.257
To Asgard!

1187
01:24:00.324 --> 01:24:03.394
To Asgard, my son.

1188
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:05.028
Yes, Father.
