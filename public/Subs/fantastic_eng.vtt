1
00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:05.730
Thank you.

2
00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:07.064
Would you like something else?

3
00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:10.193
No. No, no, not just yet.
I'm waiting.

4
00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:12.570
I'm expecting someone.

5
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:01.202
Would this be one
of your regular haunts?

6
00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:03.955
I don't have any regular haunts.

7
00:02:14.882 --> 00:02:16.759
Let me see it.

8
00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:29.272
Sometimes I imagine I still
feel it around my neck.

9
00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:32.233
I carried it for so many years.

10
00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:34.026
How does it feel around yours?

11
00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:37.989
We can free each other of it.

12
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:46.080
Love to chatter, don't they,
our Muggle friends.

13
00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:49.166
Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.

14
00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:53.838
What you're doing is madness.

15
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.091
It's what we said we'd do.

16
00:02:57.174 --> 00:02:59.886
- I was young. I was...
- Committed.

17
00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.262
To me.

18
00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.890
To us.

19
00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:07.602
No.

20
00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:10.062
I went along because...

21
00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.773
Because?

22
00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:15.151
Because I was in love with you.

23
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:18.029
Yes.

24
00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:23.034
But that's not why
you went along.

25
00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:26.412
It was you who said
we could reshape the world.

26
00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:27.914
That it was our birthright.

27
00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:51.771
Can you smell it? The stench.

28
00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.027
Do you really intend to turn
your back on your own kind?

29
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.820
For these animals?

30
00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:06.661
With or without you, I'll burn
down their world, Albus.

31
00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.997
There's nothing you can do
to stop me.

32
00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:15.962
Enjoy your cup of tea.

33
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.246
She's ready.

34
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35
00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.737
Beautiful.

36
00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.491
All right, you two.

37
00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:53.536
Now, the tricky bit.

38
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:30.239
Accio.

39
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.222
I'm so sorry.

40
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.175
Twins.

41
00:09:57.594 --> 00:09:59.263
You had twins.

42
00:12:25.117 --> 00:12:26.618
Leave us.

43
00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:30.456
Show me.

44
00:12:40.507 --> 00:12:43.177
The others,
they said it was special.

45
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.554
Ooh, it's beyond special.

46
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.848
See?

47
00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:50.809
See its eyes?

48
00:12:50.893 --> 00:12:53.103
Those eyes see everything.

49
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:58.150
When a Qilin is born,
a righteous leader will rise

50
00:12:58.233 --> 00:13:00.444
to change our world forever.

51
00:13:02.613 --> 00:13:07.993
Her birth brings change,
Credence, to everything.

52
00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:11.413
You did well.

53
00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:16.293
Go.

54
00:13:16.376 --> 00:13:17.461
Rest.

55
00:14:02.965 --> 00:14:04.424
There.

56
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:07.386
There.

57
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.820
I don't suppose
you'd like to tell me

58
00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:46.466
what this is about, would you?

59
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.676
He just asked that we meet,

60
00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.636
and that I be sure to bring you.

61
00:14:50.804 --> 00:14:51.972
Hmm. Right.

62
00:15:06.236 --> 00:15:09.197
Here to meet my brother,
I expect.

63
00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:12.326
No, sir. We're here
to see Albus Dumbledore.

64
00:15:16.163 --> 00:15:18.874
- That would be my brother.
- Oh.

65
00:15:19.833 --> 00:15:21.501
Sorry. I'm, um... Brilliant.

66
00:15:21.585 --> 00:15:23.503
I'm Newt Scamander,
and this is Theseus...

67
00:15:23.587 --> 00:15:26.131
Up the stairs.
First on the left.

68
00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:40.354
Has Newt told you
why you're here?

69
00:15:41.396 --> 00:15:42.522
Was he meant to?

70
00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:45.233
No.
As a matter of fact.

71
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.821
There's something that we, uh...

72
00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:53.408
That, uh, Dumbledore wishes
to speak to you about.

73
00:15:53.492 --> 00:15:55.035
It's a proposal.

74
00:15:58.789 --> 00:15:59.998
All right.

75
00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:04.586
You know what this is,
of course.

76
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.713
Newt had it in Paris.

77
00:16:06.797 --> 00:16:09.716
I can't say I have much
experience with such things,

78
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.760
but it looks to me
to be a blood troth.

79
00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:14.846
That would be correct.

80
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.265
And whose blood
is contained within?

81
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:19.685
Mine.

82
00:16:19.768 --> 00:16:21.436
And Grindelwald's.

83
00:16:25.148 --> 00:16:27.043
I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?

84
00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:28.110
Yes.

85
00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:30.696
Nor he against me.

86
00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:35.283
Can I ask, what would possess
you to make such a thing?

87
00:16:36.451 --> 00:16:37.786
Love.

88
00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:43.291
Arrogance. Naivete.
Pick your poison.

89
00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:46.670
We were young, we were
going to transform the world.

90
00:16:46.753 --> 00:16:47.754
Mm.

91
00:16:47.838 --> 00:16:49.047
This ensured that we would,

92
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:51.758
even if one of us
had a change of heart.

93
00:16:51.842 --> 00:16:55.595
And what would happen
if you were to fight him?

94
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:08.733
It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.

95
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:15.824
Were I to even
think about defying it...

96
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.713
It knows, you see.

97
00:17:34.593 --> 00:17:35.719
Albus.

98
00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.846
It senses the betrayal
in my heart.

99
00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:39.973
Albus.

100
00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:44.936
Albus.

101
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.284
That would be the least of it.

102
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:08.710
Young man's magic,
but as you can see,

103
00:18:09.836 --> 00:18:11.421
powerful magic.

104
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.843
It can't be undone.

105
00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:24.267
So this proposal,

106
00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:26.231
I take it the Qilin
has something to do with it?

107
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:28.063
He promises
he won't tell a soul.

108
00:18:31.525 --> 00:18:33.235
If we're to defeat him,

109
00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:35.612
the Qilin's only part of it.

110
00:18:36.905 --> 00:18:39.783
The world as we know it
is coming undone.

111
00:18:41.201 --> 00:18:45.747
Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.

112
00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:51.545
Things that seem
unimaginable today will seem

113
00:18:51.628 --> 00:18:54.089
inevitable tomorrow,

114
00:18:54.172 --> 00:18:55.841
if we don't stop him.

115
00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:00.178
Should you agree
to do what I ask,

116
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:03.849
you'll have to trust me.

117
00:19:03.932 --> 00:19:06.434
Even when every instinct
tells you not to.

118
00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:17.696
Let's hear it.

119
00:19:43.054 --> 00:19:47.434
Does he send you to spy on me?

120
00:19:48.476 --> 00:19:50.270
No.

121
00:19:50.353 --> 00:19:52.105
But he asks.

122
00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:54.524
What ya thinkin',
what ya feeling.

123
00:19:54.608 --> 00:19:56.693
And the others?

124
00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.820
Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?

125
00:19:58.904 --> 00:20:02.532
Yes, but it's mostly you.

126
00:20:03.366 --> 00:20:04.910
And do you tell him?

127
00:20:07.245 --> 00:20:09.748
You do.

128
00:20:10.707 --> 00:20:13.168
Who's reading whose mind now?

129
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:22.219
Tell me what you see.

130
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.765
You're a Dumbledore.

131
00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:30.518
It's an important family.

132
00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:33.480
You know this
because he's told you.

133
00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:39.235
He's also told you
they abandoned you.

134
00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:42.864
That you were a...
A dirty secret.

135
00:20:44.282 --> 00:20:47.827
Um... He says
Dumbledore abandoned him too,

136
00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:50.705
and he knows how you feel.

137
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:53.124
And for that reason...

138
00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.961
For that reason,
he's asked you to kill him.

139
00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:01.675
I want you to go now, Queenie.

140
00:21:05.595 --> 00:21:07.263
I don't tell him.

141
00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:10.934
Not always.

142
00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:14.813
Not everything.

143
00:22:24.132 --> 00:22:25.842
Hey, we're...

144
00:22:28.762 --> 00:22:30.346
Queenie.

145
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.890
Hi, sweetie.

146
00:22:39.355 --> 00:22:41.608
Honey...

147
00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:43.985
look at your bakery.

148
00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:45.528
It's like a ghost town.

149
00:22:46.654 --> 00:22:48.448
Yeah, well, I missed you.

150
00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:50.283
Oh, baby.

151
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:52.952
Why don't you come here?

152
00:22:53.912 --> 00:22:55.330
Come here.

153
00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:02.921
Hey.

154
00:23:05.882 --> 00:23:09.844
Everything's gonna be all right.

155
00:23:09.928 --> 00:23:13.556
Everything's gonna be just fine.

156
00:23:40.166 --> 00:23:44.170
Hey, sweetheart,
what brings you downtown?

157
00:23:44.254 --> 00:23:46.339
I really hope
you didn't spend all day

158
00:23:46.422 --> 00:23:48.383
coming up with that.

159
00:23:50.218 --> 00:23:53.680
Oh, you want scary,
is that what you want?

160
00:23:53.763 --> 00:23:55.515
You know what it is,

161
00:23:55.598 --> 00:23:58.017
you just aren't menacing enough.

162
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:02.105
I think I'm plenty menacing.

163
00:24:02.981 --> 00:24:04.899
Am I not menacing?

164
00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:07.193
Maybe if you waved
your arms around,

165
00:24:07.277 --> 00:24:08.945
you know, like a crazy man,

166
00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:11.614
then you'd appear more menacing.

167
00:24:16.744 --> 00:24:19.497
That's good. A little more.

168
00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:24.127
A little more.

169
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.962
Keep going. Perfect.

170
00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:29.591
Three, two, one.

171
00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:30.717
Hey!

172
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.764
That's enough. Get outta here.

173
00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:38.516
What's on your mind, baker boy?

174
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.767
Ah, jeez.

175
00:24:39.851 --> 00:24:41.477
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

176
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:42.645
Oh, well, we're not.

177
00:24:42.729 --> 00:24:44.564
It's a lady.

178
00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:47.609
I tell you what,

179
00:24:47.692 --> 00:24:49.360
I'll give you the first shot.
Go ahead.

180
00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:50.695
You sure?

181
00:24:50.778 --> 00:24:53.406
Oh, boy.

182
00:25:00.997 --> 00:25:03.249
Last time I ever help
that woman out again.

183
00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.667
Lally!

184
00:25:04.751 --> 00:25:07.128
Whoopsie, Frank. Sometimes
I forget my own strength.

185
00:25:07.212 --> 00:25:09.631
I'll take it from here.
Thank you!

186
00:25:09.714 --> 00:25:10.924
Welcome.

187
00:25:11.007 --> 00:25:12.842
- Catch you later, Lally.
- Bye, Stanley.

188
00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:14.806
I'll be over for a game
of Befudler Dudley soon.

189
00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:16.596
All right.

190
00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:19.390
That's my cousin Stanley.
He's a wizard.

191
00:25:19.474 --> 00:25:20.934
No.

192
00:25:21.017 --> 00:25:22.852
Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.

193
00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:24.336
I said I wanted out,
and I want out.

194
00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:25.939
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

195
00:25:26.022 --> 00:25:28.000
Can't believe my therapist
said you wizards don't exist.

196
00:25:28.024 --> 00:25:30.360
What a waste of money!

197
00:25:30.443 --> 00:25:32.904
You do know I'm a witch, right?

198
00:25:33.696 --> 00:25:34.614
Yeah.

199
00:25:34.697 --> 00:25:36.115
Look...

200
00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:37.825
you seem like
a really nice witch.

201
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:39.845
You don't know what I've been
through with you people.

202
00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:43.539
So, could you please
get out of my life?

203
00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:47.460
- A little over a year ago...
- Oh, my...

204
00:25:47.543 --> 00:25:49.271
in the hopes of securing
a small business loan,

205
00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:51.357
you walked through the doors
of the Steen National Bank,

206
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:53.758
located about six blocks
from here.

207
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:55.486
You then made the acquaintance
of Newt Scamander,

208
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.305
the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.

209
00:25:59.389 --> 00:26:00.723
You then learned of a world

210
00:26:00.807 --> 00:26:02.284
you had previously
been wholly unaware of.

211
00:26:02.308 --> 00:26:03.476
You met and fell in love

212
00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:04.912
with a witch
named Queenie Goldstein,

213
00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:06.896
had your brain wiped
by means of Obliviation,

214
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.481
only it didn't take.

215
00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:11.234
And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who,

216
00:26:11.317 --> 00:26:14.404
after your refusal
to marry her, mm,

217
00:26:14.487 --> 00:26:15.989
decided to join
Gellert Grindelwald

218
00:26:16.072 --> 00:26:17.699
and his dark army of followers,

219
00:26:17.782 --> 00:26:19.242
who pose
the single greatest threat

220
00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:22.078
to both your world and ours
in four centuries.

221
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:23.663
How did I do?

222
00:26:23.746 --> 00:26:25.540
That was good.

223
00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:26.791
Except for the part

224
00:26:26.874 --> 00:26:29.502
about Queenie going over
to the dark side.

225
00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:33.131
I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.

226
00:26:33.214 --> 00:26:35.842
But she's got a heart bigger
than this whole crazy island,

227
00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:37.802
and she's so smart, you know?

228
00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:39.725
She can legitimately
read your brain, you know,

229
00:26:39.762 --> 00:26:40.847
she's a whatchamacallit...

230
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.016
- A Legilimens.
- Yeah.

231
00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:47.937
Look...

232
00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:53.526
You see this?

233
00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:57.322
You see the pan?
That's me, I'm the pan.

234
00:26:57.405 --> 00:27:00.408
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
I'm just a schmo.

235
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:02.035
I don't know
what kind of crazy ideas

236
00:27:02.118 --> 00:27:03.578
you have
in your head there, lady,

237
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:05.764
but I'm sure as hell you could
do a lot better than me.

238
00:27:05.788 --> 00:27:07.582
Goodbye.

239
00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:09.459
I don't think we can,
Mr. Kowalski.

240
00:27:11.169 --> 00:27:14.047
You could have ducked under
the counter, but you didn't.

241
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.300
You could have looked
the other way, but you didn't.

242
00:27:17.383 --> 00:27:20.428
In fact, you were willing
to put yourself in danger

243
00:27:20.511 --> 00:27:22.889
to save a perfect stranger.

244
00:27:22.972 --> 00:27:25.224
Seems to me you're just
the kind of average Joe

245
00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:27.268
the world needs right now.

246
00:27:27.352 --> 00:27:29.228
You just don't know it yet.

247
00:27:29.312 --> 00:27:31.606
That's why I had to show you.

248
00:27:33.983 --> 00:27:37.278
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

249
00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:44.494
All right.

250
00:27:45.203 --> 00:27:46.537
Call me Jacob.

251
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:47.621
Call me Lally.

252
00:27:47.663 --> 00:27:48.956
- Lally.
- Mm.

253
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.291
I gotta lock up.

254
00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:58.341
- Thanks.
- Much better, Jacob.

255
00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:11.020
I believe you know
how this works, Jacob.

256
00:28:11.104 --> 00:28:12.146
Mm.

257
00:28:46.097 --> 00:28:48.224
What did they say
at the Ministry?

258
00:28:48.307 --> 00:28:49.976
Liu or Santos?

259
00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:53.020
Officially, the Ministry
takes no position.

260
00:28:53.104 --> 00:28:56.899
Unofficially,
smart money's on Santos.

261
00:28:56.983 --> 00:28:59.360
Although anyone
would be better than Vogel.

262
00:28:59.444 --> 00:29:00.653
Anyone?

263
00:29:03.906 --> 00:29:06.492
I don't believe
he's on the ballot, Kama.

264
00:29:06.576 --> 00:29:08.786
He also happens
to be a fugitive.

265
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.329
Is there a difference?

266
00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:15.126
Spinning!
Always with the spinning.

267
00:29:15.209 --> 00:29:16.252
Jacob.

268
00:29:17.253 --> 00:29:19.005
Welcome. You brilliant man.

269
00:29:19.088 --> 00:29:20.339
Sorry.

270
00:29:20.423 --> 00:29:21.674
I was absolutely sure

271
00:29:21.757 --> 00:29:23.509
that Professor Hicks
would convince you.

272
00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:24.594
Yeah.

273
00:29:24.677 --> 00:29:25.928
You know me, pal.

274
00:29:26.012 --> 00:29:28.639
I can't pass up a good Portkey.

275
00:29:29.348 --> 00:29:31.601
Mr. Scamander.

276
00:29:31.684 --> 00:29:32.685
Professor Hicks.

277
00:29:32.768 --> 00:29:33.936
At long last.

278
00:29:35.062 --> 00:29:36.397
So, Professor Hicks and I,

279
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:38.357
we've corresponded
for many years,

280
00:29:38.441 --> 00:29:39.859
but we've never actually met.

281
00:29:39.942 --> 00:29:42.195
So, her book on advanced
charm casting is a must-read.

282
00:29:42.278 --> 00:29:43.529
Newt is far too kind.

283
00:29:43.613 --> 00:29:45.615
Fantastic Beasts
is required reading

284
00:29:45.698 --> 00:29:47.241
for all my fifth years.

285
00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:49.202
Now, let me make
some introductions.

286
00:29:49.285 --> 00:29:51.621
So, this is, um,
Bunty Broadacre,

287
00:29:51.704 --> 00:29:53.831
my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.

288
00:29:53.915 --> 00:29:56.459
Eight... years.

289
00:29:56.542 --> 00:29:58.836
And 164 days.

290
00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920
Hmm.

291
00:29:59.962 --> 00:30:01.589
As you can see, indispensable.

292
00:30:01.672 --> 00:30:02.882
And this is...

293
00:30:02.965 --> 00:30:04.967
Yusuf Kama.

294
00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:06.469
Pleasure.

295
00:30:06.552 --> 00:30:09.931
And you, obviously, already
made Jacob's acquaintance.

296
00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:13.518
Newt.

297
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:17.230
So... So, this is my brother,
Theseus,

298
00:30:17.313 --> 00:30:19.732
and, um, he works
for the Ministry.

299
00:30:19.815 --> 00:30:22.068
Actually, head
of the British Auror Office.

300
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:23.486
Ah! Well, I'll have to ensure

301
00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:25.696
my wand registration's
up to date.

302
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.823
Yes.

303
00:30:27.907 --> 00:30:29.075
Although, strictly speaking,

304
00:30:29.158 --> 00:30:30.558
that doesn't fall
within my purview.

305
00:30:41.003 --> 00:30:42.255
Oh.

306
00:30:50.096 --> 00:30:51.347
All right then.

307
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.182
Well, I imagine
that you're all wondering

308
00:30:53.266 --> 00:30:55.476
why you find yourselves here.

309
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.436
And in anticipation of that,

310
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.690
Dumbledore asked
that I convey a message.

311
00:31:00.773 --> 00:31:02.775
So, Grindelwald has the ability

312
00:31:02.858 --> 00:31:05.278
to see snatches of the future.

313
00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:08.614
So, we have to assume that
he'll be able to anticipate

314
00:31:08.698 --> 00:31:10.616
what we do before we do it.

315
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.954
So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world,

316
00:31:15.037 --> 00:31:17.665
to save your world, Jacob,

317
00:31:17.748 --> 00:31:21.502
then our best hope
is to confuse him.

318
00:31:22.128 --> 00:31:23.129
Uh...

319
00:31:24.213 --> 00:31:25.798
'Scuse me.

320
00:31:25.881 --> 00:31:28.884
I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?

321
00:31:28.968 --> 00:31:31.053
Countersight.

322
00:31:31.137 --> 00:31:32.847
Exactly.

323
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.141
The best plan being no plan.

324
00:31:35.224 --> 00:31:36.976
Or, many overlapping plans.

325
00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:38.477
Thus, confusion.

326
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:39.979
It's working on me right now.

327
00:31:41.647 --> 00:31:44.650
In fact, Dumbledore asked that
I give you something, Jacob.

328
00:31:53.534 --> 00:31:54.994
It's snakewood.

329
00:31:55.077 --> 00:31:56.662
It's, uh, somewhat rare.

330
00:31:56.746 --> 00:31:58.831
Are you kiddin' me right now?

331
00:31:58.914 --> 00:32:00.374
Is this thing real?

332
00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:01.834
Yes.

333
00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:05.046
Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.

334
00:32:05.129 --> 00:32:06.589
It's sorta real?

335
00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:13.387
More importantly, where
we're going, you'll need it.

336
00:32:13.471 --> 00:32:15.765
Now, there's something
for you too, I think, Theseus.

337
00:32:15.848 --> 00:32:17.141
Um...

338
00:32:17.224 --> 00:32:20.227
Teddy, please let go now.

339
00:32:20.311 --> 00:32:22.104
Teddy, please let go.

340
00:32:23.147 --> 00:32:25.524
No. Teddy, will you behave?

341
00:32:25.608 --> 00:32:27.860
This is Theseus'...

342
00:32:33.157 --> 00:32:34.533
Um, that's...

343
00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:36.160
Well, of course.

344
00:32:37.453 --> 00:32:39.038
Now everything makes sense.

345
00:32:39.121 --> 00:32:42.041
Um, Lally, I believe you were
given some reading material?

346
00:32:42.124 --> 00:32:43.501
You know what they say.

347
00:32:43.584 --> 00:32:44.978
A book can take you around
the world and back,

348
00:32:45.002 --> 00:32:46.921
all you have to do is open it.

349
00:32:47.004 --> 00:32:48.047
She ain't kiddin'.

350
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.508
Yes, uh, Bunty, um...

351
00:32:51.592 --> 00:32:52.760
that's for you.

352
00:32:52.843 --> 00:32:54.887
I was told
it was for your eyes only.

353
00:32:55.763 --> 00:32:56.806
Oh.

354
00:33:06.273 --> 00:33:07.274
Oh.

355
00:33:08.693 --> 00:33:09.777
And, Kama.

356
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.904
I have what I need.

357
00:33:13.364 --> 00:33:16.742
What about Tina?
Uh, is Tina coming?

358
00:33:16.826 --> 00:33:18.494
Tina's not available.

359
00:33:18.577 --> 00:33:19.954
Um...

360
00:33:20.037 --> 00:33:23.749
Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...

361
00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:25.334
Well, from what I understand.

362
00:33:25.418 --> 00:33:28.879
Tina's been made head
of the American Auror Office.

363
00:33:28.963 --> 00:33:30.256
- Oh.
- We know each other well.

364
00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:33.467
She's quite a remarkable woman.

365
00:33:34.093 --> 00:33:35.428
She is.

366
00:33:35.511 --> 00:33:37.155
So, this is the team
that's gonna take down

367
00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:40.266
the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.

368
00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:42.685
A magizoologist,
his indispensable assistant,

369
00:33:42.768 --> 00:33:44.103
a schoolteacher,

370
00:33:44.186 --> 00:33:46.564
a wizard descended
from a very old French family,

371
00:33:46.647 --> 00:33:47.898
and...

372
00:33:47.982 --> 00:33:50.609
a Muggle baker

373
00:33:50.693 --> 00:33:52.027
with his fake wand.

374
00:33:52.111 --> 00:33:54.947
Hey, we got you too, pal,

375
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.574
and his wand works.

376
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.620
Who wouldn't like our chances?

377
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.665
Oh. Uh...

378
00:34:28.397 --> 00:34:30.065
You're all right, little one.

379
00:34:36.822 --> 00:34:38.074
Berlin.

380
00:34:39.408 --> 00:34:40.701
Wonderful.

381
00:34:46.873 --> 00:34:48.626
Kama,

382
00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.377
stay safe.

383
00:35:02.473 --> 00:35:05.476
I must be going too now, Newt.

384
00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:07.895
No one can know everything,

385
00:35:09.313 --> 00:35:10.898
not even you.

386
00:35:44.557 --> 00:35:46.100
Right.

387
00:35:46.183 --> 00:35:48.394
Well, here it is.

388
00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:05.911
Huh.

389
00:36:12.334 --> 00:36:14.295
German Ministry of Magic?

390
00:36:14.378 --> 00:36:15.462
Yes.

391
00:36:19.216 --> 00:36:21.719
I take it we're here
for a reason.

392
00:36:21.802 --> 00:36:24.847
Yes, we have
a tea ceremony to attend,

393
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.392
and if we don't hurry up,
we'll be late.

394
00:36:30.311 --> 00:36:32.938
Jacob, stay with the group.

395
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.452
Santos! Santos! Santos!

396
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.788
Santos! Santos! Santos!

397
00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:01.175
Evening...

398
00:37:02.509 --> 00:37:03.636
Helmut.

399
00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:05.638
Theseus.

400
00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:07.681
Hey, hey.

401
00:37:08.557 --> 00:37:10.434
They're with me.

402
00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:27.701
Santos! Santos! Santos!

403
00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:36.919
Incendio.

404
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.694
I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.

405
00:38:01.777 --> 00:38:05.698
Uh, no, I have
a message to deliver.

406
00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:07.074
A message?

407
00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:09.368
To who?

408
00:38:11.453 --> 00:38:13.706
Mr. Vogel,
it's a pleasure to be here.

409
00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:15.290
It's an honor to meet you.

410
00:38:15.374 --> 00:38:17.042
You are joking.

411
00:38:18.293 --> 00:38:20.087
No.

412
00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.756
What am I even
doing here? Let's go outside.

413
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.717
I'm not very good
in these situations.

414
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.301
These situations?

415
00:38:26.385 --> 00:38:28.846
With all the people,
the fancy people.

416
00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:32.349
Hello.

417
00:38:32.433 --> 00:38:34.601
I saw you enter the room

418
00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:36.228
and I thought to myself,

419
00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:39.732
Edith, that's
an interesting-looking man.

420
00:38:40.482 --> 00:38:41.650
Jacob Kowalski.

421
00:38:41.734 --> 00:38:43.861
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

422
00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:47.239
And where is it you hail from,
Mr. Kowalski?

423
00:38:47.322 --> 00:38:49.700
Queens.

424
00:38:49.783 --> 00:38:51.577
Ah!

425
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.120
Sorry, Herr Vogel.

426
00:38:53.203 --> 00:38:55.831
Sorry, I wonder
if I could have a word?

427
00:38:57.082 --> 00:38:58.375
Oh!

428
00:38:58.459 --> 00:39:01.712
Merlin's beard,
it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

429
00:39:01.795 --> 00:39:03.005
Herr Vogel...

430
00:39:05.883 --> 00:39:08.302
I have a message from a friend,

431
00:39:08.385 --> 00:39:11.096
and it cannot wait.

432
00:39:15.142 --> 00:39:16.977
Do what is right,

433
00:39:17.728 --> 00:39:19.354
not what is easy.

434
00:39:21.732 --> 00:39:23.859
He said it was important
that I reach you tonight,

435
00:39:23.942 --> 00:39:27.446
that you hear them tonight,
the words.

436
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.407
It's time, sir.

437
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:37.748
Is he here?

438
00:39:37.831 --> 00:39:39.291
In Berlin?

439
00:39:40.876 --> 00:39:42.920
No, of course not.

440
00:39:43.003 --> 00:39:46.673
Why leave Hogwarts when
the world outside is burning?

441
00:39:51.845 --> 00:39:54.848
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

442
00:40:30.259 --> 00:40:31.552
Thank you.

443
00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:34.012
Thank you.

444
00:40:36.557 --> 00:40:40.185
I see many familiar faces
here tonight.

445
00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:43.021
Colleagues, friends,

446
00:40:44.273 --> 00:40:45.315
foes.

447
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:49.653
Within the next 48 hours,

448
00:40:49.736 --> 00:40:53.407
you, along with the rest of
the Wizarding World,

449
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.951
will choose
our next great leader.

450
00:40:56.034 --> 00:40:58.412
A choice
that will shape our lives

451
00:40:58.495 --> 00:41:01.290
for generations to come.

452
00:41:01.373 --> 00:41:07.337
I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph,

453
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:10.090
the Confederation
will be in able hands.

454
00:41:10.174 --> 00:41:11.717
Liu Tao.

455
00:41:19.057 --> 00:41:20.559
Vicencia Santos.

456
00:41:22.394 --> 00:41:25.439
Thank you, thank you.

457
00:41:28.192 --> 00:41:30.986
It's in moments such as these
we are reminded

458
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:34.239
that it is this peaceful
transfer of power

459
00:41:34.323 --> 00:41:36.283
which marks our humanity

460
00:41:36.366 --> 00:41:41.246
and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences,

461
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.916
all voices
deserve to be heard...

462
00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:49.087
even voices which many
may find disagreeable.

463
00:41:51.423 --> 00:41:52.674
Newt.

464
00:41:52.758 --> 00:41:54.509
Any of those lot
look familiar to you?

465
00:41:58.847 --> 00:42:02.601
Paris. The night that Leta...

466
00:42:02.684 --> 00:42:05.103
They were with Grindelwald.

467
00:42:07.564 --> 00:42:08.565
Mm.

468
00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:22.287
And so, after
an extensive investigation,

469
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:25.457
the Confederation has concluded

470
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.585
that insufficient evidence
exists

471
00:42:29.962 --> 00:42:32.631
to prosecute Gellert Grindelwald

472
00:42:32.714 --> 00:42:34.925
for the crimes
against the Muggle community

473
00:42:35.008 --> 00:42:38.303
of which he was accused.

474
00:42:38.387 --> 00:42:44.059
He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.

475
00:42:47.604 --> 00:42:49.022
Are you kidding me?

476
00:42:49.106 --> 00:42:50.941
They're letting the guy off?

477
00:42:51.024 --> 00:42:52.818
I was there,
he was killing people.

478
00:42:53.735 --> 00:42:55.112
You're under arrest.

479
00:42:55.946 --> 00:42:57.990
All of you.

480
00:42:58.073 --> 00:42:59.116
Wands down!

481
00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:08.709
Theseus.

482
00:43:10.127 --> 00:43:11.837
Theseus!

483
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.007
Newt, Newt. Not here.

484
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.634
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

485
00:43:17.718 --> 00:43:19.678
Let's go. Newt,

486
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:22.347
they have the German Ministry.
We've got to go.

487
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:23.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

488
00:43:23.724 --> 00:43:25.851
It ain't right.
That's not justice.

489
00:43:25.934 --> 00:43:28.103
"Extended investigation."
I was there.

490
00:43:28.186 --> 00:43:30.689
Were you there?
Were you there? I was there.

491
00:43:30.772 --> 00:43:32.858
- You just let a killer off!
- Jacob.

492
00:43:32.941 --> 00:43:33.941
Whoa!

493
00:43:33.984 --> 00:43:35.777
We have to go. We have to go.

494
00:43:35.861 --> 00:43:37.779
Jacob, let's go.

495
00:44:10.228 --> 00:44:11.813
That's very good.

496
00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:16.568
Her favorite.

497
00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:21.698
Remember how she begged Mother
to make it?

498
00:44:24.534 --> 00:44:26.203
Ariana.

499
00:44:28.705 --> 00:44:30.082
Mother claimed it calmed her,

500
00:44:30.165 --> 00:44:31.750
but I think
that was wishful thinking.

501
00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:32.959
Albus.

502
00:44:34.378 --> 00:44:36.129
I was there.

503
00:44:36.213 --> 00:44:37.923
I grew up in the same house.

504
00:44:38.006 --> 00:44:41.426
Everything you saw, I saw.

505
00:44:45.972 --> 00:44:48.100
Everything.

506
00:45:00.028 --> 00:45:03.115
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

507
00:45:10.956 --> 00:45:12.833
I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.

508
00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:14.459
Tell me, what is it?

509
00:45:14.543 --> 00:45:16.670
It's Berlin.

510
00:45:16.753 --> 00:45:18.380
What happened?

511
00:45:18.463 --> 00:45:22.467
Vogel has absolved
Gellert of all his crimes.

512
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:26.471
He's free.
He says there's no proof.

513
00:45:26.555 --> 00:45:28.765
He tried to arrest Aurors
who were there

514
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:30.725
the night Leta Lestrange
was murdered.

515
00:45:42.571 --> 00:45:45.657
Rather disappointing.

516
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.993
I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.

517
00:45:48.076 --> 00:45:49.703
Can I impose on you?

518
00:45:49.786 --> 00:45:52.581
Of course.
And, Albus, please be...

519
00:45:52.664 --> 00:45:54.583
I'll do my best.

520
00:45:56.751 --> 00:45:58.670
Evening, Aberforth.

521
00:45:58.753 --> 00:46:00.172
Evening, Minerva.

522
00:46:00.255 --> 00:46:02.466
Apologies for calling you
a stupid sod.

523
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:05.260
Apology accepted.

524
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.600
I'm afraid I'll
have to cut our evening short.

525
00:46:11.683 --> 00:46:13.602
Off to save the world, are we?

526
00:46:13.685 --> 00:46:15.937
That will take
a better man than me.

527
00:46:20.775 --> 00:46:22.402
Don't ask.

528
00:46:59.523 --> 00:47:01.107
There are thousands
in the streets

529
00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:03.193
chanting your name.

530
00:47:03.276 --> 00:47:05.153
You're a free man.

531
00:47:10.325 --> 00:47:12.786
Tell the others
to prepare to leave.

532
00:47:13.745 --> 00:47:15.956
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow.

533
00:47:16.039 --> 00:47:18.291
We'll have a visitor
in the morning.

534
00:47:23.338 --> 00:47:26.258
Why does it stay with him?

535
00:47:26.341 --> 00:47:28.677
It must sense
what he's about to do.

536
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.013
And you're sure

537
00:47:33.181 --> 00:47:35.725
that he can kill Dumbledore?

538
00:47:37.435 --> 00:47:39.521
His pain is his power.

539
00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:47.904
The man
that I am inquiring about

540
00:47:47.988 --> 00:47:49.548
is the head
of the British Auror Office.

541
00:47:49.573 --> 00:47:50.824
How can you have misplaced

542
00:47:50.907 --> 00:47:52.909
the head
of the British Auror Office?

543
00:47:55.745 --> 00:47:56.955
As our contention said,

544
00:47:57.038 --> 00:47:59.499
since he was
never in our custody,

545
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:00.792
we never misplaced him.

546
00:48:00.875 --> 00:48:02.544
Sir, there were dozens
of people there.

547
00:48:02.627 --> 00:48:04.129
Any one of them
could corroborate...

548
00:48:04.212 --> 00:48:06.715
- And your name is?
- Let's get out of here.

549
00:48:06.798 --> 00:48:09.217
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

550
00:48:09.301 --> 00:48:10.969
Come here. Come here.

551
00:48:11.052 --> 00:48:12.220
Excuse me!

552
00:48:12.304 --> 00:48:13.305
Hey!

553
00:48:15.807 --> 00:48:17.601
That's the guy.
He knows where Theseus is.

554
00:48:17.684 --> 00:48:18.685
Hello!

555
00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:21.855
Where's Theseus?

556
00:48:21.938 --> 00:48:24.733
That's him.
He knows about Theseus.

557
00:48:46.129 --> 00:48:47.172
Newt.

558
00:48:49.174 --> 00:48:50.300
Ah.

559
00:49:01.019 --> 00:49:02.646
Albus.

560
00:49:06.775 --> 00:49:09.694
Theseus has been taken
to the Erkstag.

561
00:49:09.778 --> 00:49:12.364
Wait, no, but the Erkstag
shut down years ago.

562
00:49:12.447 --> 00:49:13.948
Yes, well,

563
00:49:14.032 --> 00:49:17.577
it's the Ministry's secret
little bed and breakfast now.

564
00:49:17.661 --> 00:49:19.829
You'll need this to see him.

565
00:49:20.997 --> 00:49:22.374
And one of these.

566
00:49:24.292 --> 00:49:26.336
- Mm-hmm.
- And this.

567
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.633
Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:49:33.009 --> 00:49:36.221
I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

569
00:49:36.304 --> 00:49:39.557
Me? Oh, uh... Yeah, thank you,
Mr. Dumbledore.

570
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:40.934
It's a real pip.

571
00:49:41.017 --> 00:49:42.352
I advise you to keep it close.

572
00:49:42.435 --> 00:49:44.062
- Professor Hicks.
- Dumbledore.

573
00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:46.439
Assuming you're
not otherwise engaged,

574
00:49:46.523 --> 00:49:48.066
and frankly even if you are,

575
00:49:48.149 --> 00:49:50.402
I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.

576
00:49:50.485 --> 00:49:51.945
Take Mr. Kowalski.

577
00:49:52.028 --> 00:49:54.239
I'm quite certain there'll be
an assassination attempt.

578
00:49:54.322 --> 00:49:56.074
Anything you can do
to scotch that

579
00:49:56.157 --> 00:49:57.659
will be greatly appreciated.

580
00:49:57.742 --> 00:49:58.743
It's my pleasure.

581
00:49:58.827 --> 00:50:00.120
I shall welcome the challenge.

582
00:50:00.203 --> 00:50:03.373
Besides,
I'll have Jacob with me.

583
00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:04.666
Oh, not to worry.

584
00:50:04.749 --> 00:50:07.919
Professor Hicks'
defensive magic is superb.

585
00:50:08.712 --> 00:50:09.921
Until next time.

586
00:50:10.004 --> 00:50:11.589
Such a flatterer.

587
00:50:11.673 --> 00:50:14.551
Well, not really.
It is superb.

588
00:50:15.301 --> 00:50:16.511
Albus!

589
00:50:16.594 --> 00:50:18.805
I was just wondering...

590
00:50:18.888 --> 00:50:19.931
Ah.

591
00:50:21.057 --> 00:50:22.058
Yes.

592
00:50:23.643 --> 00:50:24.978
- The case.
- Yes.

593
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:28.064
Rest assured,
it's in safe hands.

594
00:50:41.703 --> 00:50:43.163
Can I help you?

595
00:50:43.246 --> 00:50:44.998
Yes.

596
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:48.501
I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.

597
00:50:48.585 --> 00:50:49.794
Certainly.

598
00:50:51.504 --> 00:50:54.799
Oh. No, you mustn't open it.

599
00:50:54.883 --> 00:50:59.137
Um, I mean, it's not necessary.

600
00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.307
The interior isn't important.

601
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.852
I see no reason
I can't make you one.

602
00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:20.200
If you leave it here.

603
00:51:20.283 --> 00:51:21.826
Oh. No...

604
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.788
I couldn't leave it.

605
00:51:24.871 --> 00:51:28.500
And I'll be needing
more than one.

606
00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:31.127
You see, um...

607
00:51:31.211 --> 00:51:34.798
my husband...
he's a bit absentminded.

608
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:36.674
He's always forgetting things.

609
00:51:36.758 --> 00:51:38.968
Just the other day, he forgot
he was married to me.

610
00:51:41.387 --> 00:51:43.473
Can you imagine?

611
00:51:47.852 --> 00:51:50.563
But I love him.

612
00:51:50.647 --> 00:51:53.191
Exactly how many
were you thinking?

613
00:51:53.274 --> 00:51:54.692
Um...

614
00:51:54.776 --> 00:51:56.069
Half a dozen,

615
00:51:56.152 --> 00:51:58.988
and I'll need them
in two days' time.

616
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.290
Show your hands.

617
00:52:14.629 --> 00:52:15.880
Who are you?

618
00:52:16.673 --> 00:52:18.550
My name is Yusuf Kama.

619
00:52:20.051 --> 00:52:21.636
Who's our visitor?

620
00:52:21.719 --> 00:52:23.638
I'm an admirer.

621
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:25.932
You murdered his sister.

622
00:52:26.766 --> 00:52:28.685
Her name was Leta.

623
00:52:30.395 --> 00:52:32.063
Leta Lestrange.

624
00:52:32.605 --> 00:52:34.107
Ah, yes.

625
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.568
You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.

626
00:52:36.651 --> 00:52:37.902
Shared.

627
00:52:37.986 --> 00:52:41.072
That's the only thing we shared.

628
00:52:41.155 --> 00:52:45.034
Dumbledore sent you, am I right?

629
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:48.246
He fears you're in possession
of a creature.

630
00:52:48.329 --> 00:52:51.416
He fears the use
you may put it to.

631
00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:53.793
He sent me here to spy on you.

632
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.922
What would you like
me to tell him?

633
00:53:00.675 --> 00:53:01.843
Queenie.

634
00:53:03.177 --> 00:53:05.305
Is he telling the truth?

635
00:53:18.067 --> 00:53:19.319
What else?

636
00:53:19.402 --> 00:53:21.154
Even though he believes in you,

637
00:53:21.237 --> 00:53:24.198
he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.

638
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.621
He carries her absence
with him every day.

639
00:53:29.704 --> 00:53:33.207
Every breath he takes is a
reminder that she breathes no more.

640
00:53:34.876 --> 00:53:36.210
Then I presume you won't mind

641
00:53:36.294 --> 00:53:38.504
if I relieve you
of your sister's memory.

642
00:53:43.968 --> 00:53:45.136
Right?

643
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.472
Right.

644
00:54:09.369 --> 00:54:10.495
There.

645
00:54:12.038 --> 00:54:13.623
Better?

646
00:54:14.832 --> 00:54:16.250
I thought so.

647
00:54:16.334 --> 00:54:18.670
When we allow ourselves
to be consumed by anger,

648
00:54:18.753 --> 00:54:20.880
the only victim is ourself.

649
00:54:23.257 --> 00:54:26.010
Now, we were just
about to depart.

650
00:54:26.094 --> 00:54:28.471
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

651
00:54:28.554 --> 00:54:30.515
Come, we can talk some more

652
00:54:30.598 --> 00:54:32.976
about our mutual friend,
Dumbledore.

653
00:54:41.693 --> 00:54:43.111
After you.

654
00:56:10.865 --> 00:56:12.575
Hello, Credence.

655
00:56:19.707 --> 00:56:23.795
Do you know what it's like
to have no one?

656
00:56:23.878 --> 00:56:26.089
To always be alone?

657
00:56:27.381 --> 00:56:28.633
It's you.

658
00:56:31.385 --> 00:56:34.555
You're the one sending
messages in the mirror.

659
00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:37.517
I'm a Dumbledore.

660
00:56:38.226 --> 00:56:40.144
You abandoned me.

661
00:56:41.395 --> 00:56:45.650
The same blood that runs
my veins runs yours.

662
00:56:55.243 --> 00:56:57.453
He's not here for you.

663
00:56:57.537 --> 00:56:59.122
He's here for me.

664
00:57:45.084 --> 00:57:49.297
Things are not quite
what they appear, Credence,

665
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.049
no matter what you've been told.

666
00:57:54.051 --> 00:57:55.845
My name is Aurelius.

667
00:57:55.928 --> 00:57:57.388
He's lied to you.

668
00:57:57.471 --> 00:57:58.890
Kindled your hate.

669
00:58:59.408 --> 00:59:02.161
What he's told you isn't true...

670
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:06.540
but we do share the same blood.

671
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.087
You are a Dumbledore.

672
00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:26.435
I'm sorry for your pain.

673
00:59:26.519 --> 00:59:29.230
We didn't know, I promise.

674
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.369
I've come to see my brother.

675
01:00:25.453 --> 01:00:27.455
His name is Theseus Scamander.

676
01:00:36.172 --> 01:00:37.715
Sorry, that's, uh...

677
01:00:39.759 --> 01:00:41.177
Wand.

678
01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:57.443
Oh, that's, uh...

679
01:00:57.526 --> 01:01:00.654
I'm... I'm a magizoologist.

680
01:01:00.738 --> 01:01:02.656
He's perfectly harmless.
He's...

681
01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.700
He's just a pet, really.

682
01:01:06.243 --> 01:01:08.120
Sorry.

683
01:01:11.082 --> 01:01:12.249
That's Teddy.

684
01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:14.168
He's a total nightmare,
truth be told.

685
01:01:14.251 --> 01:01:15.795
They stay here.

686
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.277
So, how will I know
where to find him?

687
01:01:40.361 --> 01:01:41.779
He's your brother?

688
01:01:42.863 --> 01:01:44.156
Yes.

689
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.784
He will be the one
who looks like your brother.

690
01:01:51.122 --> 01:01:53.165
I will be back, Pick.

691
01:01:53.249 --> 01:01:54.583
On my word.

692
01:02:00.881 --> 01:02:02.758
"I'll be back, Pick.

693
01:02:02.842 --> 01:02:05.177
On my word."

694
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:08.597
And I'll be Minister of Magic
one day.

695
01:02:47.803 --> 01:02:50.097
Take us 'round the back.

696
01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:51.432
It's not safe here.

697
01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:53.017
No.

698
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.435
Roll it down.

699
01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:55.769
What?

700
01:02:56.479 --> 01:02:58.022
The window.

701
01:02:58.105 --> 01:02:59.482
Roll it down.

702
01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.746
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

703
01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.627
No. No!

704
01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:29.887
Those people

705
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.056
aren't suggesting
we listen to them.

706
01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:34.683
They aren't asking us to listen.

707
01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.977
They're demanding it.

708
01:03:37.061 --> 01:03:40.898
You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?

709
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:42.900
Yes.

710
01:03:42.983 --> 01:03:44.276
Yes, let him stand.

711
01:03:48.239 --> 01:03:50.449
Gellert Grindelwald
wants a Muggle-wizard war,

712
01:03:50.533 --> 01:03:52.159
and if he gets his wish,

713
01:03:52.243 --> 01:03:53.577
he won't just destroy
their world,

714
01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:54.954
he'll destroy ours as well.

715
01:03:55.037 --> 01:03:57.039
Which is why he cannot win.

716
01:03:58.499 --> 01:04:00.167
Let him stand as a candidate.

717
01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:01.919
Let the people vote.

718
01:04:02.002 --> 01:04:04.880
When he loses,
the people will have spoken.

719
01:04:04.964 --> 01:04:07.591
But deny them their voices,

720
01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:11.136
and those streets
will run with blood.

721
01:04:33.576 --> 01:04:34.702
Theseus.

722
01:04:39.957 --> 01:04:40.958
Theseus.

723
01:06:17.513 --> 01:06:19.056
Lally,

724
01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:20.891
the guy with the hair,

725
01:06:21.684 --> 01:06:24.019
sitting next to Edith.

726
01:06:24.103 --> 01:06:26.271
He looks like
he can kill somebody.

727
01:06:27.606 --> 01:06:29.900
He also looks like
my Uncle Dominic.

728
01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:31.235
Is your Uncle Dominic

729
01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:33.696
the Norwegian Minister of Magic?

730
01:06:33.779 --> 01:06:34.905
No.

731
01:06:34.988 --> 01:06:36.532
Didn't think so.

732
01:07:05.894 --> 01:07:06.895
Queenie.

733
01:07:08.188 --> 01:07:09.189
Queenie.

734
01:07:18.157 --> 01:07:19.450
Ah.

735
01:07:19.533 --> 01:07:23.287
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

736
01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.539
Your supporters
are in fine voice.

737
01:07:25.622 --> 01:07:29.168
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

738
01:07:48.812 --> 01:07:50.314
Rescuing me, are you?

739
01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:51.982
That's the general idea.
Huh.

740
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.735
And I presume this,

741
01:07:54.818 --> 01:07:57.821
whatever it is that
you are doing, is strategic.

742
01:07:57.905 --> 01:07:59.990
Yes, a technique
called limbic mimicry.

743
01:08:00.073 --> 01:08:02.534
It discourages
violent engagement,

744
01:08:02.618 --> 01:08:03.952
theoretically.

745
01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:06.538
I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.

746
01:08:06.622 --> 01:08:09.082
- And the results?
- Uh...

747
01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:11.418
Inconclusive.

748
01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:12.896
Course that was
a laboratory setting

749
01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.481
and the conditions
were strictly controlled,

750
01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:15.839
and the...

751
01:08:15.923 --> 01:08:17.524
Well, the current conditions
are more volatile,

752
01:08:17.549 --> 01:08:19.319
so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.

753
01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:21.804
The ultimate outcome
presumably...

754
01:08:22.805 --> 01:08:26.934
being our survival.

755
01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:22.447
Well done, come on.

756
01:09:27.786 --> 01:09:29.580
And the plan is?

757
01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:30.872
Hold this.

758
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.849
What the bloody
hell was that for?

759
01:09:48.932 --> 01:09:50.267
Um...

760
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.060
We're gonna need some help.

761
01:10:01.862 --> 01:10:03.196
Follow me.

762
01:10:08.076 --> 01:10:09.244
Come on.

763
01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:20.964
You're not swiveling properly.

764
01:10:21.048 --> 01:10:22.090
Swivel...

765
01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:24.801
Swivel, but delicately.

766
01:10:24.885 --> 01:10:27.471
I'm swiveling
like you're swiveling, Newt.

767
01:10:27.554 --> 01:10:29.222
I don't believe you are.

768
01:10:48.533 --> 01:10:49.618
Swivel.

769
01:11:02.923 --> 01:11:04.216
Go to him.

770
01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:13.392
Queenie.

771
01:11:18.063 --> 01:11:20.273
Tell him it's all right.

772
01:11:20.357 --> 01:11:22.776
I can see he's failed.

773
01:11:22.859 --> 01:11:24.528
He'll have another chance.

774
01:11:25.988 --> 01:11:28.657
It's his loyalty I most value.

775
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:04.484
Stay here.

776
01:12:24.755 --> 01:12:25.797
Oh.

777
01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:28.091
Apologies.

778
01:12:33.638 --> 01:12:34.639
Hmm.

779
01:12:54.367 --> 01:12:56.536
Let her go.

780
01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.913
Excuse me?

781
01:13:06.713 --> 01:13:08.507
- Assassin!
- Huh?

782
01:15:10.795 --> 01:15:11.838
Huh?

783
01:17:19.549 --> 01:17:20.549
No, wait.

784
01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:37.067
Newt!

785
01:17:40.403 --> 01:17:41.488
Accio!

786
01:17:42.447 --> 01:17:43.656
Grab the tie.

787
01:18:32.539 --> 01:18:34.124
That was a Portkey.

788
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:35.792
Yeah.

789
01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.713
Well done, you two.

790
01:19:04.779 --> 01:19:06.156
Not that either of you asked,

791
01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:08.658
but I would highly recommend
learning Charms.

792
01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:09.826
Lally.

793
01:19:09.909 --> 01:19:11.119
What kept you two?

794
01:19:11.202 --> 01:19:14.497
Uh, we encountered
some complications. You?

795
01:19:14.581 --> 01:19:17.333
We encountered
some complications.

796
01:19:21.379 --> 01:19:23.214
Jacob tried
to murder Grindelwald?

797
01:19:23.298 --> 01:19:25.216
It's a long story.

798
01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.010
Is it really snakewood?

799
01:19:27.093 --> 01:19:29.179
Yes, it's really snakewood.

800
01:19:29.262 --> 01:19:32.098
- Can I...
- Mm-mm.

801
01:19:32.182 --> 01:19:34.225
Very dangerous.

802
01:19:34.309 --> 01:19:35.727
It's very powerful.

803
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:38.396
It's rare. If it got
in the wrong hands, you know,

804
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.481
mess you up.

805
01:19:39.564 --> 01:19:41.274
Where did you get it?

806
01:19:42.233 --> 01:19:43.943
I got it for Christmas.

807
01:19:44.027 --> 01:19:45.195
Jacob,

808
01:19:45.278 --> 01:19:46.613
look who I found.

809
01:19:46.696 --> 01:19:47.864
Hey.

810
01:19:47.947 --> 01:19:50.033
It's my wizard friends,
Newt and Theseus.

811
01:19:50.116 --> 01:19:52.452
We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.

812
01:19:52.535 --> 01:19:55.538
I gotta go.
All right, have fun.

813
01:19:55.622 --> 01:19:57.874
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

814
01:19:57.957 --> 01:19:59.375
Can you believe this place?

815
01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:00.769
They got pint-sized
little witches and wizards

816
01:20:00.793 --> 01:20:01.628
running around here.

817
01:20:01.711 --> 01:20:03.546
You don't say.

818
01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:05.465
I was the assassin.

819
01:20:05.548 --> 01:20:07.425
Newt and Theseus
both went to Hogwarts.

820
01:20:07.509 --> 01:20:08.635
Oh, I knew that.

821
01:20:08.718 --> 01:20:10.220
Well, they're being
very nice to me.

822
01:20:10.303 --> 01:20:11.655
The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.

823
01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:13.890
They're delicious.
Who wants one?

824
01:20:13.973 --> 01:20:16.309
I never cared for cockroach
clusters much myself,

825
01:20:16.392 --> 01:20:20.146
although Honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.

826
01:20:24.817 --> 01:20:26.611
Off you go.

827
01:20:26.694 --> 01:20:27.820
McGonagall.

828
01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:29.572
Albus.

829
01:20:29.656 --> 01:20:30.740
Well done.

830
01:20:30.824 --> 01:20:32.325
All of you, well done.

831
01:20:32.408 --> 01:20:33.409
Congratulations.

832
01:20:33.493 --> 01:20:35.036
- Congratulations?
- Indeed.

833
01:20:35.119 --> 01:20:39.040
Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.

834
01:20:39.123 --> 01:20:41.668
And you are alive
and you are well.

835
01:20:41.751 --> 01:20:44.671
The fact that everything
didn't go precisely to plan

836
01:20:44.754 --> 01:20:46.130
was precisely the plan.

837
01:20:46.214 --> 01:20:47.632
Countersight 101.

838
01:20:47.715 --> 01:20:50.093
Albus, forgive me, but aren't
we back where we started?

839
01:20:50.176 --> 01:20:52.971
Actually, I would argue
that things are...

840
01:20:53.054 --> 01:20:55.306
a great deal worse.

841
01:20:57.308 --> 01:20:59.936
You haven't told them, have you?

842
01:21:00.019 --> 01:21:03.106
Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.

843
01:21:04.023 --> 01:21:05.775
- What?
- But how?

844
01:21:05.858 --> 01:21:09.654
Because Vogel chose easy
over right.

845
01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:33.261
Hmm.

846
01:21:34.345 --> 01:21:35.805
It's all right.

847
01:21:35.888 --> 01:21:36.973
Bhutan.

848
01:21:37.056 --> 01:21:39.517
Correct.
Three points to Hufflepuff.

849
01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:41.603
The kingdom of Bhutan

850
01:21:41.686 --> 01:21:43.479
sits high
in the Eastern Himalayas.

851
01:21:43.563 --> 01:21:47.275
It's a place
of indescribable beauty.

852
01:21:47.358 --> 01:21:50.945
Some of our most important
magic has its origins there.

853
01:21:51.029 --> 01:21:53.656
They say if you
listen carefully enough,

854
01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:57.118
the past whispers to you.

855
01:21:57.201 --> 01:21:59.912
It also happens to be where
the election will be held.

856
01:21:59.996 --> 01:22:01.372
He can't win, can he?

857
01:22:01.456 --> 01:22:03.750
Only a few days ago he was
a fugitive from justice.

858
01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:06.669
Now he is an official candidate

859
01:22:06.753 --> 01:22:09.422
in the International
Confederation of Wizards.

860
01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:14.302
Dangerous times
favor dangerous men.

861
01:22:16.429 --> 01:22:17.764
By the way,

862
01:22:17.847 --> 01:22:19.849
we'll be dining with
my brother in the village.

863
01:22:19.932 --> 01:22:23.603
Should you need anything
before then, Minerva is here.

864
01:22:23.686 --> 01:22:25.772
Dumbledore has a brother?

865
01:22:29.108 --> 01:22:30.443
Huh.

866
01:22:43.998 --> 01:22:45.375
Here we are.

867
01:22:49.587 --> 01:22:51.339
Bunty, you're here.

868
01:22:51.422 --> 01:22:52.423
Yes.

869
01:22:54.133 --> 01:22:55.134
How is she?

870
01:22:55.218 --> 01:22:56.427
Oh, she's fine.

871
01:22:57.428 --> 01:22:58.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

872
01:22:58.513 --> 01:23:00.098
What's Alfie done now?

873
01:23:00.181 --> 01:23:01.349
Wait, you've not been biting

874
01:23:01.432 --> 01:23:02.576
Timothy's bottom again,
have you?

875
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.893
Miss Broadacre,

876
01:23:03.976 --> 01:23:07.563
I trust my brother
has been a gracious host?

877
01:23:07.647 --> 01:23:10.024
Yes, ever so gracious.

878
01:23:10.108 --> 01:23:11.526
I'm delighted to hear.

879
01:23:11.609 --> 01:23:13.611
Uh, so, rooms have been arranged

880
01:23:13.695 --> 01:23:15.071
for you in the village,

881
01:23:15.154 --> 01:23:16.280
and Aberforth here

882
01:23:16.364 --> 01:23:18.700
will prepare you
a delicious dinner,

883
01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:20.410
his own recipe.

884
01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:29.085
There's more of that
if you want it.

885
01:23:33.506 --> 01:23:34.799
Thank you.

886
01:23:35.508 --> 01:23:36.634
Thanks.

887
01:23:39.929 --> 01:23:41.222
Astonishing.

888
01:23:41.305 --> 01:23:42.866
Never has something
that looks so repellent

889
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:44.934
tasted so delicious.

890
01:23:45.017 --> 01:23:46.769
Who is this little one?

891
01:23:46.853 --> 01:23:48.521
Do you mind?

892
01:23:48.604 --> 01:23:50.523
She's a Qilin, Jacob.

893
01:23:50.606 --> 01:23:52.358
She's incredibly rare.

894
01:23:52.442 --> 01:23:53.860
One of
the most beloved creatures

895
01:23:53.943 --> 01:23:55.403
in the Wizarding World.

896
01:23:55.486 --> 01:23:56.779
Why?

897
01:23:56.863 --> 01:23:59.157
'Cause she can see
into your soul.

898
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.575
Oh. Oh!

899
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:03.995
You're kidding me.

900
01:24:04.078 --> 01:24:08.332
No. So, if you are
good and worthy,

901
01:24:08.416 --> 01:24:09.917
then she'll see that.

902
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:13.838
But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful,

903
01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:15.882
then she'll know that too.

904
01:24:16.632 --> 01:24:17.967
Oh, yeah?

905
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:20.803
Does she just
tell you that or...

906
01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:23.055
Not exactly tells.

907
01:24:23.139 --> 01:24:24.640
Well, she bows,

908
01:24:24.724 --> 01:24:27.935
but only in the presence of
someone truly pure of heart.

909
01:24:29.896 --> 01:24:31.496
I mean, almost none of us are,
of course,

910
01:24:31.564 --> 01:24:35.151
no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.

911
01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:38.321
There was actually a time,
many, many years ago,

912
01:24:38.404 --> 01:24:40.990
when the Qilin chose
who'd lead us.

913
01:24:42.909 --> 01:24:44.035
No...

914
01:24:44.118 --> 01:24:47.330
Whoa. Woop. Whoa...

915
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.125
Okay.
All right, already.

916
01:24:54.003 --> 01:24:55.046
Here you go.

917
01:24:56.297 --> 01:24:57.297
Thriving.

918
01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:58.633
He's just hungry.

919
01:24:58.716 --> 01:25:00.068
- Look at him.
- She really likes you,

920
01:25:00.092 --> 01:25:01.092
- Jacob.
- Oh, all right.

921
01:25:04.263 --> 01:25:05.306
It's okay.

922
01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:16.234
Come with me.

923
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.362
I'll help you.

924
01:25:21.113 --> 01:25:23.241
He's your son, Aberforth.

925
01:25:26.035 --> 01:25:27.620
He needs you.

926
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.968
Newt.

927
01:25:54.689 --> 01:25:56.190
Come in.

928
01:25:56.274 --> 01:26:00.194
Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.

929
01:26:00.278 --> 01:26:01.320
Close the door.

930
01:26:09.078 --> 01:26:11.163
It's from Credence, Newt.

931
01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:17.753
The summer
Gellert and I fell in love,

932
01:26:17.837 --> 01:26:19.922
my brother fell in love as well,

933
01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:22.258
with a girl from the Hollow.

934
01:26:23.384 --> 01:26:25.052
She was sent away.

935
01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:29.223
There were rumors about a child.

936
01:26:31.058 --> 01:26:32.059
Credence...

937
01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:33.603
He's a Dumbledore.

938
01:26:36.731 --> 01:26:39.775
If I'd been a better friend...

939
01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:42.194
to Aberforth, if I'd been
a better brother...

940
01:26:43.613 --> 01:26:46.991
he might have confided in me.

941
01:26:47.074 --> 01:26:50.995
Perhaps things would have been
different, and this boy...

942
01:26:51.078 --> 01:26:54.206
could have been part of
our lives, part of our family.

943
01:26:59.712 --> 01:27:04.091
Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.

944
01:27:04.175 --> 01:27:07.845
But he may yet
be able to save us.

945
01:27:14.226 --> 01:27:16.312
Phoenix ash.

946
01:27:16.395 --> 01:27:19.982
The bird comes to him
because he's dying, Newt.

947
01:27:21.025 --> 01:27:22.735
I know the signs.

948
01:27:23.569 --> 01:27:24.946
You see...

949
01:27:26.697 --> 01:27:30.660
my sister was an Obscurial.

950
01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:34.121
And like Credence, she never
learned to express her magic.

951
01:27:35.373 --> 01:27:39.627
Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.

952
01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:43.339
Worst of all, none of us were
capable of easing her pain.

953
01:27:46.884 --> 01:27:49.720
Can you tell me
how it is that...

954
01:27:49.804 --> 01:27:51.889
or how it came
to an end for her?

955
01:27:54.934 --> 01:27:58.562
Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.

956
01:28:00.064 --> 01:28:03.275
My brother didn't approve.

957
01:28:03.359 --> 01:28:05.945
One night, he confronted us.

958
01:28:06.028 --> 01:28:08.489
Voices were raised,
threats made.

959
01:28:08.572 --> 01:28:12.201
Aberforth drew his wand,
which was foolish.

960
01:28:14.745 --> 01:28:18.207
I drew my wand,
which was even more foolish.

961
01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:23.546
Gellert just laughed.

962
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:26.465
No one heard
Ariana coming down the stairs.

963
01:28:29.427 --> 01:28:31.929
Can't say for certain
it was my...

964
01:28:33.514 --> 01:28:34.515
spell.

965
01:28:39.603 --> 01:28:41.897
Doesn't really matter.

966
01:28:41.981 --> 01:28:43.691
One minute she was there,

967
01:28:43.774 --> 01:28:45.985
and the next she was gone.

968
01:28:46.986 --> 01:28:48.821
I'm so sorry, Albus.

969
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.324
But if it's of any comfort,

970
01:28:52.408 --> 01:28:54.577
perhaps she was saved
some pain...

971
01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.203
Don't.

972
01:28:56.287 --> 01:28:58.330
Don't disappoint me, Newt.

973
01:28:59.457 --> 01:29:01.208
You of all people.

974
01:29:02.501 --> 01:29:04.879
Your honesty is a gift...

975
01:29:06.964 --> 01:29:09.592
even if at times a painful one.

976
01:29:14.346 --> 01:29:17.725
Our friends downstairs will be
tired and wanting to go home.

977
01:29:17.808 --> 01:29:20.102
You should... You should go.

978
01:29:34.116 --> 01:29:37.328
Albus,
Lally said something earlier

979
01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:41.707
about most of us
being ultimately imperfect.

980
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:45.920
But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...

981
01:29:47.379 --> 01:29:50.049
we can try to make things right.

982
01:29:52.551 --> 01:29:54.261
And that's what matters...

983
01:29:57.932 --> 01:29:59.475
trying.

984
01:30:15.407 --> 01:30:16.659
We're with you.

985
01:30:17.326 --> 01:30:18.494
Thank you.

986
01:30:26.877 --> 01:30:29.755
Our time is close,
my brothers and sisters.

987
01:30:30.756 --> 01:30:32.675
Days of hiding are over.

988
01:30:35.177 --> 01:30:37.638
The world will hear our voice.

989
01:30:40.891 --> 01:30:42.434
And it will be deafening.

990
01:30:50.484 --> 01:30:53.529
You didn't come here
to betray Dumbledore.

991
01:30:54.655 --> 01:30:57.449
You know
in your pure-blood heart,

992
01:30:59.034 --> 01:31:01.036
your place is here.

993
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.000
To believe in me
is to believe in yourself.

994
01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:20.723
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

995
01:31:43.412 --> 01:31:45.789
Vulnera Sanentur.

996
01:31:45.873 --> 01:31:50.961
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

997
01:31:51.045 --> 01:31:56.133
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

998
01:31:58.177 --> 01:32:03.849
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

999
01:32:08.729 --> 01:32:09.729
There.

1000
01:32:11.398 --> 01:32:12.816
There, there.

1001
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.111
There.

1002
01:32:18.322 --> 01:32:19.698
Come, look.

1003
01:32:23.535 --> 01:32:25.412
Hmm.

1004
01:32:25.496 --> 01:32:27.665
This is why we are special.

1005
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:31.961
To conceal our powers

1006
01:32:32.044 --> 01:32:34.546
is not merely
an affront to ourselves...

1007
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:37.508
it's sinful.

1008
01:32:52.064 --> 01:32:53.732
Was there another?

1009
01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.193
Another?

1010
01:32:57.361 --> 01:33:00.364
That night,
was there another Qilin?

1011
01:33:04.118 --> 01:33:05.327
I don't think so...

1012
01:33:07.079 --> 01:33:08.580
That's twice you failed me.

1013
01:33:08.664 --> 01:33:12.668
Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?

1014
01:33:16.463 --> 01:33:18.757
One last chance.

1015
01:33:18.841 --> 01:33:20.050
Understood?

1016
01:33:23.262 --> 01:33:24.346
Find it.

1017
01:34:18.901 --> 01:34:20.444
Hey, Newt.

1018
01:34:21.278 --> 01:34:22.905
What is this place?

1019
01:34:23.822 --> 01:34:25.908
The room we require.

1020
01:34:30.162 --> 01:34:31.997
I trust you all have the tickets

1021
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:33.749
that Bunty gave you?

1022
01:34:33.832 --> 01:34:36.418
You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.

1023
01:34:36.502 --> 01:34:37.586
What do you think, Newt?

1024
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:39.296
Can you tell which one is yours?

1025
01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.964
No.

1026
01:34:41.048 --> 01:34:42.883
Good.
I'd be worried if you could.

1027
01:34:42.966 --> 01:34:45.386
I assume the Qilin's
in one of these cases.

1028
01:34:45.469 --> 01:34:46.762
Yes.

1029
01:34:46.845 --> 01:34:48.764
- Well, which one is it?
- Which one indeed.

1030
01:34:48.847 --> 01:34:51.183
Ooh, it's like
a three-card monte thing.

1031
01:34:51.266 --> 01:34:53.143
Like a shell game thing.

1032
01:34:53.227 --> 01:34:54.395
Like a short con.

1033
01:34:56.271 --> 01:34:58.148
Never mind, it's a Muggle thing.

1034
01:34:58.232 --> 01:35:00.651
Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers

1035
01:35:00.734 --> 01:35:03.070
to get his hands
on our rare friend.

1036
01:35:03.153 --> 01:35:05.406
Therefore,
it's essential that we keep

1037
01:35:05.489 --> 01:35:09.118
whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing,

1038
01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:12.287
so the Qilin gets
to the ceremony safely.

1039
01:35:12.371 --> 01:35:17.876
If, by teatime, the Qilin,
not to mention all of us,

1040
01:35:18.752 --> 01:35:20.462
are still alive,

1041
01:35:20.546 --> 01:35:23.465
we should consider
our efforts a success.

1042
01:35:23.549 --> 01:35:25.050
For the record, nobody ever died

1043
01:35:25.134 --> 01:35:27.010
playing three-card monte.

1044
01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.390
An important distinction.

1045
01:35:31.473 --> 01:35:32.808
All right,
everybody choose a case

1046
01:35:32.891 --> 01:35:34.309
and we'll be on our way.

1047
01:35:34.393 --> 01:35:38.147
Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.

1048
01:35:39.022 --> 01:35:40.023
Me?

1049
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:45.737
Okay.

1050
01:36:10.429 --> 01:36:12.574
I'm looking forward to you
educating me a little further

1051
01:36:12.598 --> 01:36:15.476
on the finer points
of three-card monte.

1052
01:36:17.603 --> 01:36:18.645
Mm.

1053
01:36:21.273 --> 01:36:22.733
My pleasure.

1054
01:36:26.069 --> 01:36:27.696
Well...

1055
01:36:27.779 --> 01:36:29.823
Good luck, everybody.

1056
01:36:32.493 --> 01:36:33.535
Good luck.

1057
01:36:34.703 --> 01:36:37.498
And you too, Bunty girl.

1058
01:36:40.292 --> 01:36:41.793
See you, Bunty.

1059
01:36:56.141 --> 01:36:58.477
It is not lost
on those of us in leadership

1060
01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.523
that we are currently
a world divided.

1061
01:37:02.606 --> 01:37:06.318
Each day brings
talk of another conspiracy.

1062
01:37:06.401 --> 01:37:08.904
Each hour another dark whisper.

1063
01:37:08.987 --> 01:37:12.866
These whispers have
only increased in recent days,

1064
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:16.411
with the addition
of a third candidate.

1065
01:37:16.495 --> 01:37:20.749
There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt

1066
01:37:21.667 --> 01:37:23.252
that a worthy candidate exists

1067
01:37:23.335 --> 01:37:27.005
amongst the three
you have been presented.

1068
01:37:45.399 --> 01:37:49.486
As every schoolboy
and girl knows,

1069
01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:54.116
the Qilin
is the purest of creatures

1070
01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:56.785
in our wonderful magical world.

1071
01:37:56.868 --> 01:37:58.745
It cannot be deceived.

1072
01:38:00.289 --> 01:38:02.958
Let the Qilin unite us.

1073
01:38:23.186 --> 01:38:25.147
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1074
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.440
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1075
01:38:33.363 --> 01:38:35.907
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1076
01:38:37.409 --> 01:38:39.077
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1077
01:38:51.381 --> 01:38:52.382
Come.

1078
01:38:56.178 --> 01:38:58.096
Where to, next?

1079
01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.515
Uh, this is where I leave you.

1080
01:39:00.599 --> 01:39:02.976
I'm... I'm sorry, you're what?

1081
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:04.353
Leaving me?

1082
01:39:04.436 --> 01:39:07.689
I have to meet someone else,
Mr. Kowalski.

1083
01:39:07.773 --> 01:39:09.066
Not to worry,

1084
01:39:09.941 --> 01:39:11.485
you'll be perfectly safe.

1085
01:39:15.447 --> 01:39:17.658
You don't have the Qilin.

1086
01:39:17.741 --> 01:39:21.328
Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.

1087
01:39:21.411 --> 01:39:24.581
One other thing,
if you don't mind me saying.

1088
01:39:24.665 --> 01:39:27.042
You should
stop doubting yourself.

1089
01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:30.212
You have something most men
go their entire lives without.

1090
01:39:30.295 --> 01:39:31.797
Do you know what that is?

1091
01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:36.343
A heart that is full.

1092
01:39:36.426 --> 01:39:38.303
Only a truly brave man

1093
01:39:38.387 --> 01:39:42.432
could open himself up
so honestly and completely,

1094
01:39:42.516 --> 01:39:43.558
as you do.

1095
01:40:12.003 --> 01:40:13.797
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1096
01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.717
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1097
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.970
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1098
01:41:26.953 --> 01:41:29.831
Cases, please.

1099
01:41:48.975 --> 01:41:50.018
Hey, fellas.

1100
01:41:54.523 --> 01:41:55.565
Woo-hoo-hoo.

1101
01:41:58.610 --> 01:41:59.820
He's angry.

1102
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:18.839
Wait. Open them,
make sure it's in there.

1103
01:42:18.922 --> 01:42:19.922
Idiots.

1104
01:44:05.695 --> 01:44:07.238
How long does he have?

1105
01:44:48.488 --> 01:44:50.532
Here. Hey. Hi.

1106
01:44:50.615 --> 01:44:51.866
You're in danger, all right?

1107
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:53.576
- You need to leave.
- Well...

1108
01:44:54.703 --> 01:44:57.205
I can't... I can't go, okay?

1109
01:44:57.288 --> 01:44:58.623
I can't come home.

1110
01:44:58.707 --> 01:45:00.000
It's too late for me, all right?

1111
01:45:00.083 --> 01:45:02.752
Some mistakes,
they're just too big.

1112
01:45:02.836 --> 01:45:04.504
Can you listen to me?

1113
01:45:04.587 --> 01:45:07.424
There's no time.
I was followed.

1114
01:45:07.507 --> 01:45:08.758
I gave 'em the slip,

1115
01:45:08.842 --> 01:45:10.552
but it won't be long
before they find me.

1116
01:45:10.635 --> 01:45:12.262
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't care.

1117
01:45:13.471 --> 01:45:14.931
All I got is us.

1118
01:45:15.015 --> 01:45:16.433
I make no sense without us.

1119
01:45:16.516 --> 01:45:19.310
Jacob, what? Come on...

1120
01:45:19.394 --> 01:45:21.354
I don't love you anymore.
Just get outta here.

1121
01:45:21.438 --> 01:45:23.940
You're the worst liar in
the world, Queenie Goldstein.

1122
01:45:25.608 --> 01:45:26.735
You hear that?

1123
01:45:26.818 --> 01:45:28.278
What? No.

1124
01:45:28.361 --> 01:45:29.946
That's a sign.

1125
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:31.156
Oh, man.

1126
01:45:31.239 --> 01:45:33.533
- Oh, come on.
- Come here, come here.

1127
01:45:33.616 --> 01:45:34.993
Close your eyes.

1128
01:45:35.869 --> 01:45:37.787
Please close your eyes.

1129
01:45:39.330 --> 01:45:41.332
You know
what Dumbledore said to me?

1130
01:45:41.958 --> 01:45:43.376
No.

1131
01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.920
He said that I got a full heart.

1132
01:45:50.008 --> 01:45:51.885
He's wrong.

1133
01:45:51.968 --> 01:45:54.679
I'm always gonna have room
in there for you.

1134
01:45:56.014 --> 01:45:57.223
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1135
01:45:57.307 --> 01:45:58.600
You know it.

1136
01:45:59.726 --> 01:46:01.019
Look at me.

1137
01:46:03.855 --> 01:46:05.523
Queenie Goldstein.

1138
01:47:11.631 --> 01:47:13.007
Mr. Scamander.

1139
01:47:13.091 --> 01:47:15.009
We've never been
properly introduced.

1140
01:47:15.093 --> 01:47:17.971
Henrietta Fischer,

1141
01:47:18.054 --> 01:47:19.639
Herr Vogel's attache.

1142
01:47:19.722 --> 01:47:21.724
Ah. Yes, uh,

1143
01:47:21.808 --> 01:47:22.725
hello.

1144
01:47:22.809 --> 01:47:25.478
I can take you up.

1145
01:47:25.562 --> 01:47:28.773
There's a private entrance for
members of the High Council.

1146
01:47:29.774 --> 01:47:31.526
If you just follow me.

1147
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:33.361
I'm sorry,
why would you do that?

1148
01:47:34.028 --> 01:47:35.864
Take me up?

1149
01:47:35.947 --> 01:47:38.199
Isn't it obvious?

1150
01:47:38.283 --> 01:47:41.202
No, frankly, it's, uh, not.

1151
01:47:45.415 --> 01:47:47.417
Dumbledore sent me.

1152
01:47:49.335 --> 01:47:53.256
I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1153
01:48:14.736 --> 01:48:16.654
He should be here any minute.

1154
01:49:20.426 --> 01:49:21.886
What kept you?

1155
01:49:36.276 --> 01:49:39.112
I thank the candidates
for their words.

1156
01:49:39.195 --> 01:49:42.407
Each represents
a distinct vision

1157
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:45.326
of how we will not shape
only our world,

1158
01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:48.037
but the non-magical world
as well.

1159
01:49:49.372 --> 01:49:50.957
Which brings us

1160
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.544
to the most important part
of our ceremony,

1161
01:49:54.627 --> 01:49:56.838
the walk of the Qilin.

1162
01:51:26.344 --> 01:51:28.638
The Qilin has seen.

1163
01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:31.432
Seen goodness,

1164
01:51:31.516 --> 01:51:33.434
strength,

1165
01:51:33.518 --> 01:51:38.356
qualities essential to lead
and to guide us.

1166
01:51:40.525 --> 01:51:42.777
Who do you see?

1167
01:51:58.543 --> 01:52:02.797
Gellert Grindelwald is the new
leader of the magical world

1168
01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.590
by acclamation.

1169
01:52:43.838 --> 01:52:46.757
This is the man
who tried to take my life.

1170
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:52.638
This man, who has no magic,

1171
01:52:52.722 --> 01:52:55.933
who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood,

1172
01:52:56.017 --> 01:53:00.021
create a forbidden union
that would make us less,

1173
01:53:00.104 --> 01:53:02.231
make us weak, like his kind.

1174
01:53:04.192 --> 01:53:05.985
He's not alone, my friends.

1175
01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:10.573
There are thousands
who seek to do the same.

1176
01:53:12.116 --> 01:53:15.703
There can only be one response
to such vermin.

1177
01:53:25.254 --> 01:53:26.464
No.

1178
01:53:29.967 --> 01:53:31.469
Crucio.

1179
01:53:31.552 --> 01:53:32.970
No!

1180
01:53:35.139 --> 01:53:37.225
Make him stop!

1181
01:53:37.308 --> 01:53:42.438
Our war with the Muggles
begins today.

1182
01:53:59.997 --> 01:54:01.582
Jacob.

1183
01:54:41.747 --> 01:54:43.708
He's lying to you.

1184
01:54:46.294 --> 01:54:48.588
That creature is dead.

1185
01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:58.139
Not now. Wait.

1186
01:55:02.768 --> 01:55:04.312
He did it to trick you.

1187
01:55:04.395 --> 01:55:07.106
He killed it and bewitched it

1188
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:10.109
so that you might think him
worthy to lead.

1189
01:55:12.403 --> 01:55:14.655
But he doesn't want to lead you.

1190
01:55:17.116 --> 01:55:19.243
He just wants you to follow.

1191
01:55:19.994 --> 01:55:21.162
Words.

1192
01:55:22.538 --> 01:55:25.333
Words designed to deceive.

1193
01:55:25.416 --> 01:55:27.697
To make you doubt what you've
seen with your own two eyes.

1194
01:55:27.752 --> 01:55:29.462
There were two Qilins
born that night.

1195
01:55:29.545 --> 01:55:31.839
A twin.
And I know that...

1196
01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:34.383
I know that...

1197
01:55:34.467 --> 01:55:35.593
Because?

1198
01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:42.850
Because you have no proof.

1199
01:55:42.933 --> 01:55:45.144
Because there was
no second Qilin.

1200
01:55:46.437 --> 01:55:47.730
Am I not right?

1201
01:55:47.813 --> 01:55:49.106
Its mother
had been killed, it...

1202
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:51.734
Then where is it now,
Mr. Scamander?

1203
01:56:17.468 --> 01:56:19.720
No one can know
everything, Newt.

1204
01:56:19.804 --> 01:56:21.055
Remember?

1205
01:56:51.377 --> 01:56:52.795
I don't get it.

1206
01:57:04.849 --> 01:57:07.268
She can't hear you, little one.

1207
01:57:08.811 --> 01:57:10.271
Not here...

1208
01:57:11.897 --> 01:57:14.483
but perhaps somewhere
she's listening.

1209
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:20.364
This is the true Qilin.

1210
01:57:21.615 --> 01:57:23.159
Look at it,

1211
01:57:23.242 --> 01:57:25.411
you can see it
with your own eyes.

1212
01:57:25.494 --> 01:57:27.663
This is the true...

1213
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:34.670
This can't be allowed to stand.

1214
01:57:34.754 --> 01:57:37.173
The vote must be taken again.

1215
01:57:37.256 --> 01:57:40.050
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1216
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:09.997
You...

1217
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.916
No, no, no, please.

1218
01:58:37.316 --> 01:58:40.027
I'm honored.

1219
01:58:40.110 --> 01:58:43.280
But just as two of you
were born that night,

1220
01:58:43.364 --> 01:58:46.826
there's another here,
equally worthy.

1221
01:58:48.244 --> 01:58:50.120
I'm certain of it.

1222
01:59:05.636 --> 01:59:06.971
Thank you.

1223
02:01:59.435 --> 02:02:01.520
Who will love you now,
Dumbledore?

1224
02:02:04.523 --> 02:02:06.066
You're all alone.

1225
02:02:56.533 --> 02:02:58.535
I was never your enemy.

1226
02:03:05.751 --> 02:03:08.587
Then, or now.

1227
02:03:49.378 --> 02:03:51.463
Did you ever think of me?

1228
02:03:54.091 --> 02:03:55.384
Always.

1229
02:04:02.766 --> 02:04:04.143
Come home.

1230
02:04:52.608 --> 02:04:54.443
Here she is.

1231
02:04:56.028 --> 02:04:57.654
Well done, Bunty.

1232
02:05:01.658 --> 02:05:03.994
Come on, little one.

1233
02:05:04.077 --> 02:05:06.914
I'm sorry. I must have
given you an awful fright.

1234
02:05:06.997 --> 02:05:08.207
No, I think, um,

1235
02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:09.917
sometimes it takes
losing something

1236
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.419
to realize
quite how much it means.

1237
02:05:15.297 --> 02:05:17.466
And sometimes you just...

1238
02:05:20.969 --> 02:05:23.430
Sometimes you just know.

1239
02:05:33.190 --> 02:05:35.359
Right, in you pop.

1240
02:05:37.569 --> 02:05:39.655
Mr. Kowalski.

1241
02:05:41.031 --> 02:05:43.075
I owe you an apology.

1242
02:05:43.158 --> 02:05:44.785
It... It was never my intent

1243
02:05:44.868 --> 02:05:47.621
for you to suffer
the Cruciatus curse.

1244
02:05:48.664 --> 02:05:50.082
Yeah...

1245
02:05:50.165 --> 02:05:52.292
Well, you know, we got Queenie
back, so we're square.

1246
02:05:52.376 --> 02:05:55.212
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1247
02:05:55.295 --> 02:05:56.838
Can I keep this?

1248
02:05:56.922 --> 02:05:58.715
For, like, old times' sake?

1249
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:04.888
I can't think of anyone
more deserving.

1250
02:06:07.182 --> 02:06:08.767
Thanks, Professor.

1251
02:06:29.496 --> 02:06:31.331
- Remarkable.
- But how?

1252
02:06:31.415 --> 02:06:33.142
I thought you couldn't
move against one another.

1253
02:06:33.166 --> 02:06:34.918
We didn't.

1254
02:06:35.002 --> 02:06:37.963
He sought to kill,
I sought to protect.

1255
02:06:38.046 --> 02:06:39.923
Our spells met.

1256
02:06:41.425 --> 02:06:44.386
Let's call it fate.

1257
02:06:44.469 --> 02:06:48.098
After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?

1258
02:06:49.933 --> 02:06:51.226
Albus.

1259
02:06:52.978 --> 02:06:54.604
Promise me.

1260
02:06:56.732 --> 02:06:58.942
You'll find him
and you'll stop him.

1261
02:07:26.511 --> 02:07:29.598
Albert,
don't forget the pierogis.

1262
02:07:29.681 --> 02:07:31.058
Yes, Mr. K.

1263
02:07:31.141 --> 02:07:32.601
Albert.

1264
02:07:32.684 --> 02:07:35.437
No more than eight minutes
on the kolaczkis.

1265
02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.938
Yes, Mr. K.

1266
02:07:37.022 --> 02:07:38.482
He's a sweet kid.
He doesn't know

1267
02:07:38.565 --> 02:07:40.692
the difference between
paszteciki and golabki.

1268
02:07:40.776 --> 02:07:42.069
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What?

1269
02:07:42.152 --> 02:07:43.588
Newt doesn't know
what you're talking about.

1270
02:07:43.612 --> 02:07:44.964
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1271
02:07:44.988 --> 02:07:47.908
And you are not working today,
remember?

1272
02:07:47.991 --> 02:07:49.576
Oh!

1273
02:07:49.659 --> 02:07:51.370
Oh, are you all right, honey?

1274
02:07:51.453 --> 02:07:53.580
Oh, you're nervous about
the speech. Don't be nervous.

1275
02:07:53.663 --> 02:07:54.664
Tell him, honey.

1276
02:07:54.748 --> 02:07:55.975
Don't be nervous
about the speech.

1277
02:07:55.999 --> 02:07:57.292
I'm not nervous.

1278
02:07:57.376 --> 02:07:58.960
What is the smell?
Why is there burning?

1279
02:07:59.044 --> 02:08:00.462
Albert?

1280
02:08:02.881 --> 02:08:06.134
Mm. Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?

1281
02:08:06.218 --> 02:08:08.595
I can't imagine
what you're talking about.

1282
02:08:08.678 --> 02:08:09.805
Mm-hmm.

1283
02:08:22.984 --> 02:08:25.070
So, the day
that I first met Jacob...

1284
02:08:25.153 --> 02:08:26.238
Uh...

1285
02:08:26.321 --> 02:08:27.781
The day that I first met Jacob,

1286
02:08:27.864 --> 02:08:30.033
we were both sitting
in the Steen National Bank.

1287
02:08:31.785 --> 02:08:33.078
Never would I...

1288
02:08:47.551 --> 02:08:49.594
The maid of honor, I presume?

1289
02:08:51.513 --> 02:08:53.932
The best man, I gather?

1290
02:08:55.642 --> 02:08:57.018
You've done something
to your hair.

1291
02:08:57.102 --> 02:08:58.103
No.

1292
02:08:58.812 --> 02:08:59.813
Oh.

1293
02:09:01.273 --> 02:09:03.608
Well, yes, actually, just...

1294
02:09:03.692 --> 02:09:04.818
Just for tonight.

1295
02:09:04.901 --> 02:09:06.486
- Well, it suits you.
- Thank you, Newt.

1296
02:09:11.116 --> 02:09:12.116
Oh.

1297
02:09:12.159 --> 02:09:13.368
- Hello.
- Hi.

1298
02:09:13.452 --> 02:09:14.995
Look who's...

1299
02:09:15.078 --> 02:09:16.079
Hi.

1300
02:09:17.164 --> 02:09:18.999
So good to see you.

1301
02:09:19.082 --> 02:09:20.584
- Hi.
- How are you?

1302
02:09:20.667 --> 02:09:21.835
You look wonderful, Lally.

1303
02:09:21.918 --> 02:09:24.171
Well, thank you, Newt.
I appreciate it.

1304
02:09:24.254 --> 02:09:25.255
Good luck.

1305
02:09:25.338 --> 02:09:26.756
Tina, come on.
You must tell me

1306
02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:28.842
- how MACUSA's been.
- See you inside.

1307
02:09:34.473 --> 02:09:36.683
What about me? How do I look?

1308
02:09:36.766 --> 02:09:38.226
- You all right?
- You look fine.

1309
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:40.395
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1310
02:09:40.479 --> 02:09:41.938
You're not nervous, are you?

1311
02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:44.390
Can't be nervous about a speech

1312
02:09:44.441 --> 02:09:46.318
after saving the world. Hmm.

1313
02:10:03.418 --> 02:10:06.087
It's a historic day.

1314
02:10:06.171 --> 02:10:10.926
Where once was before,
there will now be after.

1315
02:10:13.678 --> 02:10:16.223
Funny how historic days
seem so ordinary

1316
02:10:16.306 --> 02:10:18.517
when you're living them.

1317
02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:19.880
Well, perhaps
that's what happens

1318
02:10:19.935 --> 02:10:21.394
when the world
gets things right.

1319
02:10:21.478 --> 02:10:24.439
Mm, it's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.

1320
02:10:28.318 --> 02:10:31.112
I didn't know
if I'd see you here.

1321
02:10:31.196 --> 02:10:32.697
I wasn't sure you would, either.

1322
02:10:32.781 --> 02:10:34.199
Hey, Newt.

1323
02:10:34.282 --> 02:10:35.492
Yes.

1324
02:10:35.575 --> 02:10:37.327
Jacob seems to think
he's lost the ring.

1325
02:10:37.410 --> 02:10:38.570
Please tell me you've got it.

1326
02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:40.580
No, it's all good. Yep.

1327
02:10:40.664 --> 02:10:41.915
Whew.

1328
02:10:41.998 --> 02:10:43.625
That scared me. Jacob!

1329
02:10:46.419 --> 02:10:47.546
Good man, Pick.

1330
02:10:52.759 --> 02:10:54.302
I should probably, um...

1331
02:10:56.012 --> 02:10:57.222
Thank you, Newt.

1332
02:10:58.807 --> 02:10:59.933
What for?

1333
02:11:00.016 --> 02:11:01.560
Pick your poison.

1334
02:11:03.603 --> 02:11:06.356
I really couldn't have done it
without you.

1335
02:11:13.154 --> 02:11:15.657
I'd do it again, by the way.

1336
02:11:17.409 --> 02:11:18.994
Should you ask.

1337
02:11:34.342 --> 02:11:35.343
Okay.

1338
02:11:37.596 --> 02:11:38.638
Hey.

1339
02:11:49.858 --> 02:11:50.775
- Hey!
- Hello!

1340
02:11:50.859 --> 02:11:53.028
Bunty!

1341
02:11:53.111 --> 02:11:54.654
Bunty!

1342
02:12:14.424 --> 02:12:17.552
Wow, you're so beautiful.

1343
02:12:23.141 --> 02:12:24.267
Oh.

1344
02:12:25.101 --> 02:12:27.228
I can't believe it.

1345
02:12:47.791 --> 02:12:49.376
This is, um...
This is Albert.

1346
02:12:49.459 --> 02:12:51.086
I don't know
if you've met Albert, yet?

1347
02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:52.629
Have you met Lally?
