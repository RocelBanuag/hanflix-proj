1
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.200
You're all clear.

2
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.674
DEA!

3
00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:47.910
Secure the area.

4
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:10.825
Clear.

5
00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.773
Throw down your weapon.

6
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.090
Throw down your weapon!
Throw down your weapon.

7
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:17.493
Down!

8
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.963
<i>Â¡Abajo!</i> On your knees.

9
00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:23.265
Hands up.

10
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.067
Turn around.

11
00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:28.370
Turn around!

12
00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:41.749
Cap!

13
00:05:44.453 --> 00:05:45.753
James.

14
00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:47.890
We need him alive.

15
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:04.106
You gotta check this out.

16
00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:16.839
- Where'd you get that?
- You like it?

17
00:08:16.972 --> 00:08:19.208
- Looks expensive.
- It was.

18
00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:23.579
I mean it is. I...

19
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:27.049
I got it from a friend.
She didn't need it anymore.

20
00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.052
Mom wanted you
to come down.

21
00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:32.254
She said Dad
should be here soon.

22
00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:34.655
All right,
I'll be there in a minute.

23
00:09:06.021 --> 00:09:07.322
Daddy!

24
00:09:08.957 --> 00:09:11.160
Hey, sweetie!

25
00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:12.694
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

26
00:09:12.828 --> 00:09:14.163
I'm good.

27
00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:16.064
Got a little banged up,
though.

28
00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:18.500
- You okay?
- I'll be fine.

29
00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:24.440
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

30
00:09:31.246 --> 00:09:32.481
I remember you.

31
00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:35.350
Why are you limping?

32
00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:38.387
Uh, bug bite.

33
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.358
It'll be okay.

34
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.427
It's nice to have you home.

35
00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:53.068
I feel much better now.

36
00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:24.366
- Watch your back, man.
- Hey, Johnny.

37
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.235
I heard you were
getting out today.

38
00:10:27.436 --> 00:10:29.338
We got some
unfinished business.

39
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.640
Oh, Jesus.

40
00:10:31.773 --> 00:10:33.008
Listen.

41
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:34.911
I don't wanna have
any trouble, all right?

42
00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:37.546
I'm getting out soon and...

43
00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:54.663
Hey, bitch, here.

44
00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:56.765
Fuck this, man.

45
00:11:23.158 --> 00:11:25.661
I can't wait to get
the fuck out of here.

46
00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:28.664
Jesus.

47
00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:34.503
Aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon,

48
00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:37.773
three counts
of first-degree armed robbery.

49
00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:42.045
Do you take your responsibility
for your actions?

50
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:45.581
What I feel bad about is, uh...

51
00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:50.652
You know,
I killed somebody's husband.

52
00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:54.289
His name was George
and he had two kids, and...

53
00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.493
I took that away from them,
and I'm sorry about it,

54
00:11:58.627 --> 00:12:02.364
but, um, I'll always be
sorry about it.

55
00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.535
I'm just...
You know, I just wanna...

56
00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:09.404
I don't know what I wanna do.

57
00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:13.175
I just wanna
be the best man I can be.

58
00:12:13.308 --> 00:12:18.014
You have quite the impressive
military record.

59
00:12:18.146 --> 00:12:20.917
A Silver Star,
two Purple Hearts,

60
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.651
three tours of duty.

61
00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.853
Afghanistan. Iraq.

62
00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:30.158
I think that if anyone
deserves another chance,

63
00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:31.928
it's you, sir.

64
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:35.697
I hope to God
I never see you again.

65
00:12:39.902 --> 00:12:42.404
You know, honestly,
I could kinda tell something was going on.

66
00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:44.673
Like, I could feel it.

67
00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.776
And then Tom said
that he liked Serafina,

68
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.745
and I was like...

69
00:12:57.319 --> 00:12:58.687
No, no!

70
00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:01.523
Dad?

71
00:13:06.528 --> 00:13:08.830
Girls, could you excuse us
for a second?

72
00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.346
Are you all right?

73
00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:27.849
I'm okay.

74
00:13:32.155 --> 00:13:35.190
I guess you don't wanna talk
about what happened.

75
00:13:35.323 --> 00:13:38.326
Talk about what?

76
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.796
I'm glad you're still
a sarcastic asshole.

77
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.698
Yeah, well, I try.

78
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.736
What's going on?

79
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:51.339
- Babe...
- Just...

80
00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.477
Anybody up for some dessert?

81
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:00.016
Wow.

82
00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:02.217
Look at that cake.

83
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.519
And I got you guys this.

84
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.555
Huh?

85
00:14:07.123 --> 00:14:08.390
Open it.

86
00:14:11.526 --> 00:14:13.228
Sunrose Cabins?

87
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:16.264
At first, I thought we could
all go together this weekend,

88
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.332
like old times.

89
00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:19.334
But now I see that you two

90
00:14:19.468 --> 00:14:21.536
need some "alone" time.

91
00:14:23.206 --> 00:14:25.507
Where did you get
that money?

92
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.144
Serafina's mom got it as
a giveaway at some event,

93
00:14:28.276 --> 00:14:31.613
and they couldn't use it,
so they asked if we wanted it.

94
00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:33.315
Okay. Right?

95
00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:35.383
Yeah, why not?

96
00:14:36.384 --> 00:14:37.319
Thanks, babe.

97
00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:39.688
Well, thank you.

98
00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:11.419
- Oh, goddamn!
- Johnny!

99
00:15:11.553 --> 00:15:13.622
Oh, goddamn,
so nice to see you.

100
00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:14.589
Oh!

101
00:15:14.723 --> 00:15:16.159
Good to see you,
man.

102
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.293
Oh, it's been so long.

103
00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:30.006
Been a long time.

104
00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:31.706
You look good.

105
00:15:35.912 --> 00:15:37.546
Thanks for the ride.

106
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.653
Let me get
your stuff, man.

107
00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:47.089
- It's good to have you home.
- Johnny's back!

108
00:15:51.793 --> 00:15:53.728
Let's get
the fuck outta here.

109
00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:11.680
Listen, I've heard
what you two have been doin'.

110
00:16:11.813 --> 00:16:13.115
It's all over the tube.

111
00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:15.784
Everybody knows
y'all are going straight now.

112
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.856
I did promise, uh,
Ma and Pa

113
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.691
I'd keep you
on the straight and narrow,

114
00:16:22.824 --> 00:16:25.493
so you've just gotta,
you know,

115
00:16:25.627 --> 00:16:27.129
do the right thing, lay low.

116
00:16:27.263 --> 00:16:28.931
Keep our shit tight.

117
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:31.800
Well, you got
the money, right?

118
00:16:32.902 --> 00:16:36.305
I knew you still had it.
Where is it?

119
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.443
Listen, I don't want you two
involved, all right?

120
00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:44.579
We can get it in and out.
No problem at all.

121
00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.948
Just tell us
where you put it.

122
00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:47.649
If they catch your ass
with the money,

123
00:16:47.782 --> 00:16:49.584
they're gonna send you
back there.

124
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.820
Oh, I ain't gonna worry
about that.

125
00:16:52.487 --> 00:16:54.623
Ain't nobody gonna find shit.

126
00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:57.994
Listen, I'm hungry.
Let's grab a hot dog somewhere.

127
00:16:58.127 --> 00:16:59.728
Sounds good to us.

128
00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:07.836
Our old house?

129
00:17:08.502 --> 00:17:09.436
Brilliant.

130
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.539
We looked everywhere.

131
00:17:11.673 --> 00:17:13.708
Never thought
you'd put it in there.

132
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.878
You okay?

133
00:17:51.513 --> 00:17:54.016
Yeah. I'm getting there.

134
00:17:56.718 --> 00:18:00.923
Listen, here's a map I drew
where I put everything.

135
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.560
Piece of cake.

136
00:18:05.694 --> 00:18:07.430
We won't let you
down, Johnny.

137
00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.367
Listen, boys, the only thing
I really give a fuck about

138
00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:13.002
is that ring.

139
00:18:13.936 --> 00:18:15.204
Okay?

140
00:18:15.338 --> 00:18:18.074
We got some serious shit we
gotta take care of, all right?

141
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:22.144
Don't let nothing fuck it up,
all right? You hear me?

142
00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:23.678
- We got you.
- We got it.

143
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:26.449
Just keep it cool
until we get the job done.

144
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:27.515
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:28.884
All right.

146
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.222
What are you doing?

147
00:19:08.623 --> 00:19:10.759
Where are you getting
all this cash from?

148
00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:12.194
Shh!

149
00:19:15.563 --> 00:19:17.199
Can you keep a secret?

150
00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:19.534
I found it.

151
00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:21.703
You found
all of that money?

152
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.708
- Look.
- Holy shit!

153
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.880
- We have to tell Mom and Dad.
- We can't tell Mom and Dad!

154
00:19:31.013 --> 00:19:33.015
You don't know
who this money belongs to!

155
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:36.684
Who cares who it belonged to?
It's ours now.

156
00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:39.922
It's probably, like,
really old.

157
00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.724
Like when this house
was first built, anyways.

158
00:19:43.993 --> 00:19:46.795
The bank
is AGL Bank and Trust.

159
00:19:48.364 --> 00:19:49.597
What do you mean?

160
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.599
Well, I found it,
so I'm gonna spend it.

161
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.070
It's my money now.
Here, take one.

162
00:19:54.203 --> 00:19:55.371
I don't want it!

163
00:19:55.504 --> 00:19:57.506
And it's not yours,
it's someone else's!

164
00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:59.874
It was someone else's,
but I found it,

165
00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:01.643
- therefore it's now mine.
- I don't want it.

166
00:20:01.776 --> 00:20:03.979
- Just take some, have fun, spend it!
- No!

167
00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:05.981
I have plenty of fun,
thank you very much!

168
00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:07.383
- I'm not gonna steal...
- Doing what?

169
00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:08.616
- What?
- Doing what?

170
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.885
You don't have fun
doing anything.

171
00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:11.220
You're always
being such a prude.

172
00:20:11.353 --> 00:20:13.089
If you don't want it,
I'll take it.

173
00:20:13.222 --> 00:20:14.256
Wow.

174
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:16.724
Good luck, Jen.

175
00:20:29.939 --> 00:20:31.373
Look at this joint.

176
00:20:32.074 --> 00:20:34.809
- '64 Malibu.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:37.880
- Nice setup here, bro.
- Thank you very much.

178
00:20:38.013 --> 00:20:39.381
I was hoping
you'd like it.

179
00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.283
Wow, this is tits.

180
00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:43.085
- Cool, man.
- Let's have some beers, huh?

181
00:20:43.219 --> 00:20:45.387
Let's go. Hey, brother,
did you get that done yet?

182
00:20:45.521 --> 00:20:49.391
- Hey, you can't rush perfection.
- Yeah, right.

183
00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.868
You gotta run
a tight ship, okay?

184
00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:02.271
- Yes, sir.
- Keep everything tight.

185
00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:05.174
As tight as my ex-wife.

186
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:07.276
From this night on,

187
00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:10.379
no more sticking that shit up your
nose, all right?

188
00:21:10.513 --> 00:21:11.746
Done.

189
00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:15.451
You watch out for your
little brother, huh?

190
00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:16.986
- I will.
- All right.

191
00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:19.922
I promise,
we're not gonna let you down.

192
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.260
So, here's to freedom!

193
00:21:24.393 --> 00:21:26.694
Here's to good-lookin'
snapper, boys.

194
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:27.862
Cheers.

195
00:21:27.997 --> 00:21:29.731
- All right, little brother.
- Yeah.

196
00:21:29.864 --> 00:21:31.200
Fuckin'-A.

197
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.768
Aren't you a little
young to be drinking?

198
00:21:33.903 --> 00:21:35.371
Oh, go stick it, boy.

199
00:22:33.629 --> 00:22:35.197
You know, babe,

200
00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:38.300
this could really be like
a second honeymoon.

201
00:22:40.802 --> 00:22:42.238
Wow.

202
00:22:43.505 --> 00:22:45.140
This place is really nice.

203
00:23:02.258 --> 00:23:04.994
Is something
on your mind?

204
00:23:09.098 --> 00:23:12.001
I didn't recognize you
when you came home.

205
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:14.836
James Baker.

206
00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:17.973
And you are?

207
00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.776
Lisa Rodriguez.

208
00:23:27.349 --> 00:23:28.517
Nice to meet you.

209
00:23:31.887 --> 00:23:34.957
Babe, I'm still
the same man you married.

210
00:23:37.026 --> 00:23:39.328
I don't want you working
for them anymore.

211
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.032
I'm not.

212
00:23:43.699 --> 00:23:45.833
- Really?
- Really.

213
00:23:46.902 --> 00:23:48.137
Why?

214
00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:50.339
I'm just not.

215
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:52.274
What are you gonna do?

216
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.511
I don't know.

217
00:23:58.347 --> 00:23:59.982
But I'm starting
to get an idea.

218
00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:02.384
Come here.

219
00:24:19.601 --> 00:24:22.504
I got a bad fucking
feeling about this.

220
00:24:24.073 --> 00:24:25.374
You'll be all right.

221
00:24:27.976 --> 00:24:29.912
Just stay close
to me.

222
00:24:46.595 --> 00:24:47.963
Four of them.

223
00:24:48.697 --> 00:24:51.467
There's Daddy, Mommy

224
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.503
and their two daughters.

225
00:24:55.571 --> 00:24:56.572
Piece of cake.

226
00:24:57.272 --> 00:25:00.175
But hands off my two cupcakes.

227
00:25:00.943 --> 00:25:02.644
'Cause they're mine.

228
00:25:04.313 --> 00:25:07.149
We're just going in to
make sure it's all there.

229
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.487
We're gonna wait
until they're gone

230
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.821
to actually get it.

231
00:25:12.955 --> 00:25:14.323
Ah, fuck.

232
00:25:15.224 --> 00:25:17.092
Where's the fun in that?

233
00:25:18.494 --> 00:25:22.064
Johnny wants it quiet.
And clean.

234
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:29.538
What Johnny wants,
Johnny gets.

235
00:25:30.472 --> 00:25:32.474
Yeah. He does.

236
00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:36.578
All right.

237
00:25:38.514 --> 00:25:39.648
Come on.

238
00:26:36.538 --> 00:26:37.573
- Wait!
- What?

239
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.278
Is he asleep?

240
00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:50.018
- Oh, shit! Go, go, go, go!
- Fuck!

241
00:26:58.093 --> 00:26:59.695
James!

242
00:27:07.836 --> 00:27:09.338
- James.
- Mom?

243
00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:12.341
Go back to your rooms,
right now. Right now!

244
00:27:13.075 --> 00:27:14.443
James.

245
00:27:15.277 --> 00:27:17.012
Give me the gun.

246
00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:20.015
Give me the gun.

247
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.294
Baby.

248
00:27:33.262 --> 00:27:35.230
You've gotta get help.

249
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.467
I'm all right.

250
00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:54.049
Oh, what the fuck?

251
00:27:54.182 --> 00:27:55.817
We should have killed him.

252
00:27:55.952 --> 00:27:57.152
I need to think.

253
00:27:57.286 --> 00:28:00.122
Think? You're always
fucking thinking!

254
00:28:00.255 --> 00:28:02.558
Stop thinking! All right?

255
00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:05.827
Now we know who the fuck
we're dealing with.

256
00:28:05.962 --> 00:28:07.262
Right?

257
00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:10.832
So why don't we just
fuck off back home,

258
00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:13.535
think of something else?

259
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:17.472
We'll come back later
and take care of business.

260
00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:23.078
Fuck.

261
00:28:59.015 --> 00:29:00.282
Baby.

262
00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:06.521
I need help.

263
00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:13.428
What are we gonna do
about this?

264
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:19.534
I don't think we should keep
that in the house for a while.

265
00:29:24.907 --> 00:29:28.210
Baby, I'd understand it
if you want me to leave.

266
00:29:29.012 --> 00:29:30.445
Oh.

267
00:29:30.947 --> 00:29:32.648
No, baby, no.

268
00:29:39.122 --> 00:29:40.722
I'm not gonna leave you.

269
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:28.770
Every night?

270
00:30:30.572 --> 00:30:33.341
I knew you were having
a hard time, but I...

271
00:30:35.777 --> 00:30:36.913
Yeah.

272
00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:39.648
That's why I need you here.

273
00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:42.919
I'm afraid
I'm gonna hurt my family.

274
00:30:44.586 --> 00:30:45.687
Hey.

275
00:30:47.422 --> 00:30:49.691
We're not gonna
let that happen.

276
00:30:49.825 --> 00:30:50.960
You got me?

277
00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.495
It'll just be
for a little while,

278
00:30:53.628 --> 00:30:55.363
just till I get this
under control.

279
00:30:55.497 --> 00:30:57.566
I am here
as long as you need.

280
00:30:59.768 --> 00:31:00.836
Appreciate it.

281
00:31:02.071 --> 00:31:04.673
<i>There's
nothing wrong with you, James.</i>

282
00:31:05.874 --> 00:31:06.943
<i>I'm serious.</i>

283
00:31:07.076 --> 00:31:09.578
<i>What you experienced
is a normal reaction</i>

284
00:31:09.711 --> 00:31:12.748
<i>to extremely
abnormal experiences.</i>

285
00:31:17.285 --> 00:31:19.088
So what
am I supposed to do?

286
00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:22.091
How do I tell
from what's real

287
00:31:22.225 --> 00:31:24.426
and what's... you know.

288
00:31:25.928 --> 00:31:29.031
<i>Start with one thing
you can see with your eyes.</i>

289
00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:31.234
<i>The tree.</i>

290
00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:34.569
<i>Then what can you hear
with your ears?</i>

291
00:31:34.703 --> 00:31:37.039
<i>I can hear the buzzing
of my air conditioner.</i>

292
00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:40.609
<i>What can you sense
with your skin?</i>

293
00:31:41.777 --> 00:31:44.981
<i>My collar on my neck.
My watch on my arm.</i>

294
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.382
<i>What do you taste?</i>

295
00:31:48.483 --> 00:31:50.685
<i>The coffee I just drank
on my tongue.</i>

296
00:31:51.286 --> 00:31:54.289
<i>Now, what do you smell?</i>

297
00:31:55.992 --> 00:31:59.162
<i>My perfume. Those flowers.</i>

298
00:31:59.294 --> 00:32:02.397
<i>Focusing on your five senses
will get you out of your head</i>

299
00:32:02.531 --> 00:32:04.399
<i>and back to the present.</i>

300
00:32:05.567 --> 00:32:07.502
<i>Now, you try.</i>

301
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:09.805
<i>What do you see?</i>

302
00:32:15.178 --> 00:32:17.880
<i>You're going to have to try
a lot harder than that.</i>

303
00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:24.053
Um, Jennifer's drawing.

304
00:32:24.187 --> 00:32:25.922
<i>Good.</i>

305
00:32:26.055 --> 00:32:28.390
<i>Now, what do you hear?</i>

306
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.443
Ah.

307
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:52.447
Hey. Talk to me.

308
00:32:53.715 --> 00:32:54.850
What?

309
00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:59.021
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "not yet"?

310
00:33:00.923 --> 00:33:02.524
Look, look,
do what you gotta do.

311
00:33:02.657 --> 00:33:03.758
We went over it, just...

312
00:33:03.893 --> 00:33:05.694
All right.
I'll take care of it.

313
00:33:06.295 --> 00:33:07.762
No worries. We got this.

314
00:33:07.897 --> 00:33:10.699
All right. No, it's cool.
Bye.

315
00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:21.743
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

316
00:33:25.948 --> 00:33:29.551
Yeah, honey, I got it all written down.
I won't forget the milk.

317
00:33:29.684 --> 00:33:32.121
Milk, butter, cereal.
I got it, honey.

318
00:33:32.255 --> 00:33:34.489
All right, I'll see you soon.
Love you too. Bye.

319
00:33:34.623 --> 00:33:36.025
Wife busting
the chops again, huh?

320
00:33:36.158 --> 00:33:38.460
Let me give you
a little marriage advice.

321
00:33:38.593 --> 00:33:40.428
She's the boss.
Whatever she says goes.

322
00:33:40.562 --> 00:33:41.763
Happy wife, happy life.

323
00:33:41.898 --> 00:33:43.132
Here's the file
you asked for.

324
00:33:43.266 --> 00:33:45.935
- You take care of that. I gotta run.
- All right.

325
00:33:55.344 --> 00:33:56.345
Hey.

326
00:33:56.478 --> 00:33:58.747
Well, goddamn! Goddamn!

327
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:01.483
Oh! What you doin'? Oh!

328
00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:04.086
- Are you sneakin' up on me? Huh?
- Yeah.

329
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.188
- Mr. Policeman! Yeah.
- Yeah, well, look at you.

330
00:34:06.322 --> 00:34:09.690
- Look at you, man. Filled out.
- Yeah, little bit.

331
00:34:09.824 --> 00:34:12.395
- You look like a million bucks, brother.
- And you do too.

332
00:34:12.527 --> 00:34:15.364
- Well, they finally let you out, huh?
- Yeah.

333
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.433
I was beginning to think they were
gonna keep your ass locked up forever.

334
00:34:18.565 --> 00:34:21.835
Yeah, well, you know,
it felt like forever.

335
00:34:23.272 --> 00:34:24.839
Listen, coz, uh,

336
00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:27.442
I need your help
on something.

337
00:34:28.945 --> 00:34:32.847
Well, must be serious, huh?
What's in it for me?

338
00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:39.422
More money than you're making
doing what you're doing, bro.

339
00:34:39.554 --> 00:34:40.956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

340
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.827
I can cut your ass in
for 2% of three million.

341
00:34:47.897 --> 00:34:50.498
Two percent of three million.
Let's see...

342
00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:52.935
That's $60,000.

343
00:34:54.569 --> 00:34:56.705
Well, it must be
something serious, huh?

344
00:34:56.838 --> 00:34:58.673
Well, this is my career
we're talking about.

345
00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:01.710
I'm gonna have to ask
for about 10% on that.

346
00:35:04.447 --> 00:35:05.714
Deal.

347
00:35:07.149 --> 00:35:08.117
You got it.

348
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.752
All right, man.
Let's make some money.

349
00:35:10.886 --> 00:35:12.888
- Let's make some money.
- All right. Welcome back.

350
00:35:13.022 --> 00:35:15.324
Let's make some noise, bro.
Let's go have a beer.

351
00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:17.059
Yeah. Come on.

352
00:35:17.193 --> 00:35:19.895
Let's go find us
a supermodel or two.

353
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.131
Now we're talking.

354
00:35:33.641 --> 00:35:34.642
Sometimes I...

355
00:35:34.776 --> 00:35:38.147
I can't tell what's real...

356
00:35:39.482 --> 00:35:41.217
or what's in my head.

357
00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.154
<i>There's nothing to
be ashamed of with PTSD.</i>

358
00:35:45.287 --> 00:35:47.890
<i>You just have to take it
one day at a time.</i>

359
00:35:48.523 --> 00:35:50.026
<i>It takes time.</i>

360
00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:53.661
<i>Your brain is still processing
a traumatic experience.</i>

361
00:35:53.795 --> 00:35:55.663
<i>The next time
you're in that compound,</i>

362
00:35:55.797 --> 00:35:57.799
<i>here's an exercise you can do.</i>

363
00:35:57.933 --> 00:35:59.834
<i>Every time
you look at your thumb,</i>

364
00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:03.805
<i>ask yourself, "Is this real</i>

365
00:36:04.873 --> 00:36:06.409
<i>or is this fake?"</i>

366
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:08.077
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

367
00:36:14.682 --> 00:36:16.185
Is this real?

368
00:36:16.851 --> 00:36:19.055
<i>Or is this fake?</i>

369
00:36:19.188 --> 00:36:21.090
Or is this fake?

370
00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:22.590
<i>Well?</i>

371
00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:24.060
Real.

372
00:36:24.193 --> 00:36:26.694
<i>Good. That's a good start.</i>

373
00:36:26.828 --> 00:36:29.564
<i>Keep doing it
until it becomes a habit.</i>

374
00:36:33.235 --> 00:36:36.138
<i>You're still going
on vacation with your wife?</i>

375
00:36:36.939 --> 00:36:39.375
<i>I don't know.</i>

376
00:36:39.508 --> 00:36:42.811
<i>You should. I think
it'd be good for you two.</i>

377
00:36:42.945 --> 00:36:44.813
<i>She needs you too, James.</i>

378
00:36:44.947 --> 00:36:47.316
<i>Just as much as you need her
right now.</i>

379
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.118
<i>Don't shut her out.</i>

380
00:36:55.524 --> 00:36:57.126
Mr. James Baker?

381
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.765
- Hello.
- Hey.

382
00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:06.135
Well, I appreciate you
coming down here, sir.

383
00:37:06.268 --> 00:37:07.970
Yeah.
So how can I help you, Sheriff?

384
00:37:08.104 --> 00:37:10.473
Well, it seems we've got
ourselves a little problem.

385
00:37:10.605 --> 00:37:11.907
What kinda problem?

386
00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:14.477
Well, it's probably
not gonna amount to much.

387
00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:16.845
I know you're DEA
and all that.

388
00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:19.681
Well, I got a warrant here
with your name on it.

389
00:37:20.682 --> 00:37:22.384
James Baker, yeah?

390
00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:29.791
"Breach of Peace"?
This is bullshit.

391
00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:32.161
- I just got here.
- Well...

392
00:37:32.294 --> 00:37:34.829
it must have followed you
from San Antone.

393
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.799
- This makes no sense.
- Hmm.

394
00:37:37.933 --> 00:37:40.402
Listen, I got a buddy
in the government.

395
00:37:40.536 --> 00:37:42.271
He sent me your record.
Hope you don't mind.

396
00:37:42.404 --> 00:37:44.806
But I gotta tell ya,
I'm very impressed.

397
00:37:45.341 --> 00:37:47.076
DEA, military. Phew.

398
00:37:48.344 --> 00:37:53.048
But it also says that you
were just diagnosed with PTSD.

399
00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:55.850
Post-Traumatic Stress.

400
00:37:55.985 --> 00:37:58.521
That's a terrible thing.

401
00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:01.856
See, I was in
the service myself,

402
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:03.926
and, well, let's say
I knew a lot of guys

403
00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:06.061
who pretended they were sick

404
00:38:06.195 --> 00:38:08.898
so they could get a little
extra on their pension.

405
00:38:09.932 --> 00:38:11.534
That's a shameful thing
to do.

406
00:38:11.666 --> 00:38:13.269
What the fuck?

407
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.205
This is signed
by the attorney's office.

408
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:18.507
There's no judge's signature
on this.

409
00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:19.975
There's not?

410
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:21.843
No. No.

411
00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:24.113
Let me see
that goddamn thing.

412
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:30.718
Well, I'll be damned.
You're right.

413
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:33.721
I don't know
what you're trying to pull,

414
00:38:33.855 --> 00:38:35.857
but next time you try
to bring me down here,

415
00:38:35.991 --> 00:38:38.561
you contact my superiors,
my RAC,

416
00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:40.262
and don't waste my time.

417
00:38:41.063 --> 00:38:42.298
Hmm.

418
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:45.334
Deputy, will you show
this gentleman out?

419
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:49.004
What the fuck did you have me
come down here for anyway?

420
00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:11.961
Yeah, he just left.

421
00:39:12.895 --> 00:39:14.897
Yeah.

422
00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.746
They're leaving.

423
00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:36.151
This is
an in-and-out job.

424
00:39:37.553 --> 00:39:39.255
No more problems.

425
00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:43.259
This ain't your average
snatch and grab, boys.

426
00:39:43.392 --> 00:39:45.793
We gotta make this one
calculated.

427
00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:49.864
- We'll see about that.
- Yeah, we fucking will.

428
00:39:51.233 --> 00:39:53.435
You gotta keep your head
in this one, man.

429
00:39:54.536 --> 00:39:56.438
Well, let's fucking see.

430
00:40:46.388 --> 00:40:48.057
Ho! Let's go!

431
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.858
What are we waitin' for now?
Fucking Christmas?

432
00:40:50.993 --> 00:40:53.696
Dominic, relax. What if
they forgot something?

433
00:40:53.828 --> 00:40:57.499
Forgot something? What the fuck
are they gonna forget?

434
00:40:57.633 --> 00:40:59.501
Let's fucking do this!

435
00:40:59.635 --> 00:41:02.371
Man.
Keep your fucking head.

436
00:41:03.272 --> 00:41:05.541
Ah. Fucking head!

437
00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:11.407
You wanna knock
that the fuck off?

438
00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:31.994
Mom and Dad
are gonna be pissed.

439
00:42:32.127 --> 00:42:33.362
They'll never know.

440
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.199
Isn't that what they say in the
movies before they get caught?

441
00:42:37.332 --> 00:42:39.368
Then they won't be surprised
when they catch us.

442
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:40.869
You. Catch you.

443
00:42:41.003 --> 00:42:43.105
Catch me. Whatever.

444
00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:45.541
I had nothing to do
with this.

445
00:42:45.674 --> 00:42:47.676
It's not like I invited
the whole school.

446
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:56.985
Hit that shit!

447
00:42:58.687 --> 00:42:59.688
Oh!

448
00:43:04.293 --> 00:43:05.961
Didn't get the invite.

449
00:43:07.262 --> 00:43:08.730
It's melon ice.

450
00:43:08.864 --> 00:43:11.300
Yo, yo, yo.
Kiwi's the best flavor, no cap.

451
00:43:11.433 --> 00:43:13.702
Tom, that's so cap, bro.

452
00:43:13.836 --> 00:43:16.738
You're like 50% cap,
50%...

453
00:43:16.872 --> 00:43:18.674
What?

454
00:43:18.807 --> 00:43:20.042
Naughty!

455
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.745
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's fucking go!

456
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.047
Let's go, let's go!

457
00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.583
We're doing this,
Tommy boy! Whoo!

458
00:43:27.716 --> 00:43:29.218
Why you so riled up,
Tom?

459
00:43:29.351 --> 00:43:31.553
Why you so riled up
right now?

460
00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:33.222
Good job, bitch!

461
00:43:33.957 --> 00:43:36.625
- So, uh...
- Her parents are gone.

462
00:43:36.758 --> 00:43:39.461
- But what about Natalie?
- Don't worry about her.

463
00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:44.333
Look, I'll handle her,
you handle Dyana.

464
00:43:44.466 --> 00:43:45.534
All right.

465
00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:51.273
I'll be in my room.

466
00:43:51.406 --> 00:43:53.642
You know, maybe
if you were nicer to people,

467
00:43:53.775 --> 00:43:54.877
you'd have more friends.

468
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.211
Maybe if you weren't,

469
00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.013
people wouldn't think
you were so vapid.

470
00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:02.551
Hey!

471
00:44:02.684 --> 00:44:03.920
Whoo!

472
00:44:04.052 --> 00:44:06.421
Okay, okay.

473
00:44:06.555 --> 00:44:08.557
Somebody gonna get it
in tonight!

474
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.126
Somebody gonna get it in!

475
00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:13.495
The more, the merrier.

476
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.053
Is this real? Is this real?

477
00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:51.099
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

478
00:44:56.271 --> 00:44:58.041
Are you sure you wanna know?

479
00:44:58.173 --> 00:44:59.808
Of course I wanna know.

480
00:45:02.678 --> 00:45:04.646
If we can...

481
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.148
James.

482
00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:08.684
Just tell me.

483
00:45:11.921 --> 00:45:13.255
Okay.

484
00:45:13.822 --> 00:45:15.157
Pull over.

485
00:45:45.754 --> 00:45:47.356
Are you kidding me?

486
00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:08.377
Damn it.

487
00:46:12.848 --> 00:46:14.182
What?

488
00:47:32.061 --> 00:47:34.429
There was a firefight.

489
00:47:38.567 --> 00:47:40.802
We exchanged gunfire.

490
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.479
After we'd taken the...
the men down...

491
00:47:58.054 --> 00:47:59.621
...there was...

492
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:03.792
We saw blood

493
00:48:05.293 --> 00:48:08.497
<i>coming from
underneath a closet.</i>

494
00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:17.773
And when we opened the closet,
there...

495
00:48:22.044 --> 00:48:23.378
there were...

496
00:48:25.248 --> 00:48:28.416
a mother
and two daughters.

497
00:48:30.318 --> 00:48:33.956
They had been killed
by our gunfire.

498
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.323
Uh...

499
00:48:36.591 --> 00:48:39.028
Babe, I see them.

500
00:48:40.196 --> 00:48:41.596
I see them.

501
00:48:42.265 --> 00:48:43.765
It was an accident.

502
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:48.336
It's not your fault.

503
00:48:50.539 --> 00:48:53.943
That's just it.
It was. I...

504
00:48:56.478 --> 00:48:58.613
- Baby...
- It was just a mistake.

505
00:49:02.118 --> 00:49:03.752
It was my mistake.

506
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.532
I love you.
You know that, right?

507
00:49:19.467 --> 00:49:20.735
I love you too, babe.

508
00:49:24.406 --> 00:49:27.876
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

509
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.514
It's okay.

510
00:49:33.648 --> 00:49:35.750
Ah, come over here.

511
00:50:21.264 --> 00:50:22.631
Fuck!

512
00:50:55.197 --> 00:50:56.831
Who is she?

513
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.136
<i>There's a bit of totty for me.</i>

514
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.644
What the fuck?

515
00:51:14.984 --> 00:51:17.386
You just scared me.

516
00:51:18.354 --> 00:51:22.124
What are you doing hanging out outside?

517
00:51:24.726 --> 00:51:26.195
I see you weren't expecting me.

518
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:29.631
He just looked at me.
Did he just fucking look at me?

519
00:51:29.764 --> 00:51:30.900
You okay?

520
00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:32.467
Yeah.

521
00:51:33.768 --> 00:51:36.238
Your dad just asked me
to check on you, so...

522
00:51:38.441 --> 00:51:39.641
That's not my fault.

523
00:51:39.774 --> 00:51:42.510
Oh, now we're blaming
our sister?

524
00:51:42.644 --> 00:51:43.946
You know me.

525
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.114
I know.

526
00:51:46.548 --> 00:51:48.184
Can I show you something?

527
00:51:48.317 --> 00:51:50.186
- Yeah.
- Okay.

528
00:51:54.723 --> 00:51:56.459
I'll fucking rub you,
you fuckin' cunt!

529
00:51:56.591 --> 00:51:58.793
We need to figure
this shit out, man.

530
00:52:06.969 --> 00:52:09.205
Natalie, what's going on?

531
00:52:20.483 --> 00:52:21.616
Where did you get this?

532
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.253
I found it
under the floorboards.

533
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.257
I think my sister
found some money too.

534
00:52:31.994 --> 00:52:34.263
I was doing some research,

535
00:52:34.763 --> 00:52:36.232
and I found this.

536
00:52:37.732 --> 00:52:39.335
"Was arrested
for a string of robberies

537
00:52:39.468 --> 00:52:42.004
that terrorized the city
and sentenced to 15 years,

538
00:52:42.138 --> 00:52:43.571
maximum federal
penitentiary."

539
00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:45.408
None of the money
was ever recovered.

540
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.209
Okay, okay.

541
00:52:47.343 --> 00:52:48.643
We don't know it's his.

542
00:52:48.777 --> 00:52:50.112
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

543
00:52:50.246 --> 00:52:52.281
This money has been here
for a long time.

544
00:52:52.415 --> 00:52:56.385
We don't know any of that.
We don't know anything.

545
00:52:56.519 --> 00:52:57.819
Put it back.

546
00:52:58.387 --> 00:52:59.889
Just put it back.

547
00:53:01.524 --> 00:53:03.492
- Have you told anyone else?
- No.

548
00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:05.660
Good.
Have you spent any of it?

549
00:53:05.794 --> 00:53:07.897
Seriously?
I mean, what are we gonna do?

550
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.697
Mom and Dad aren't
even here right now.

551
00:53:09.831 --> 00:53:11.666
And she's downstairs
acting like a crazy...

552
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.170
- Calm. Nat... Natalie.
- ...wild child!

553
00:53:14.303 --> 00:53:16.405
It's not against the law
to find money.

554
00:53:17.339 --> 00:53:20.109
Okay? We're gonna figure
this out. Not a problem.

555
00:53:20.242 --> 00:53:22.844
Just put it back.
Let's go talk to Jen.

556
00:53:23.979 --> 00:53:26.148
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

557
00:53:44.467 --> 00:53:46.668
What the fuck
are you doing?

558
00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:52.041
Fueling the fire.

559
00:53:52.575 --> 00:53:54.676
Fueling my calm.

560
00:53:55.643 --> 00:53:57.046
See, this

561
00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.049
is the calm
before the storm.

562
00:54:01.183 --> 00:54:03.618
And it's gonna be
a big fucking storm.

563
00:54:05.454 --> 00:54:06.922
Oh.

564
00:54:16.631 --> 00:54:18.601
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

565
00:54:18.733 --> 00:54:21.070
Johnny wanted us
to bring this guy?

566
00:54:22.238 --> 00:54:24.706
Are you gonna
keep it together?

567
00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:28.277
- Rip off your beard!
- Get the fuck off me, bro.

568
00:54:29.211 --> 00:54:32.814
- Chill the fuck out.
- You'll be okay.

569
00:54:36.952 --> 00:54:40.422
Bro, are you gonna be
the fuck all right?

570
00:54:40.556 --> 00:54:42.191
We got shit to do,

571
00:54:42.324 --> 00:54:44.994
and you gotta have your
fucking brain together, man.

572
00:54:50.032 --> 00:54:51.733
Let's fucking do it.

573
00:54:51.866 --> 00:54:54.836
Let's fucking do it. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

574
00:54:56.005 --> 00:54:57.839
It's time to play.

575
00:54:58.706 --> 00:55:00.242
Can we fucking play?

576
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.710
Please.

577
00:55:13.122 --> 00:55:14.390
Hey!

578
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.925
Where's Jen?

579
00:55:16.058 --> 00:55:17.526
What's your problem?

580
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.928
Where's my sister?

581
00:55:19.061 --> 00:55:21.397
I don't know.
I think they went to her room.

582
00:55:21.964 --> 00:55:22.898
I'll get her.

583
00:55:23.032 --> 00:55:24.866
I'll check the back.

584
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.843
Jen.

585
00:55:38.846 --> 00:55:40.316
I need to talk to you.

586
00:55:40.449 --> 00:55:41.517
I'm kinda busy.

587
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:43.285
It's important.

588
00:55:43.419 --> 00:55:44.920
- Can it wait?
- No.

589
00:55:45.588 --> 00:55:47.089
Fine. What is it?

590
00:55:49.892 --> 00:55:51.527
I found
something in my room.

591
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.929
Congratulations. You found
something in your room.

592
00:55:54.063 --> 00:55:57.333
I'm so proud of you.
Now get the fuck out my room.

593
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.035
Where were we?

594
00:56:00.169 --> 00:56:02.338
Let's see what
everyone else is doing.

595
00:56:02.804 --> 00:56:04.240
But, Jen...

596
00:56:04.373 --> 00:56:06.542
There's more important
things going on right now.

597
00:56:06.675 --> 00:56:08.377
- Like what?
- Put your clothes on.

598
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:10.812
Look, Jen, just 30 minutes.

599
00:56:10.946 --> 00:56:13.015
Like you can last that long.

600
00:56:14.216 --> 00:56:15.884
Why not?

601
00:56:16.018 --> 00:56:17.486
There's nothing going on
downstairs.

602
00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.854
I have stuff to do.
Get dressed!

603
00:56:20.723 --> 00:56:22.524
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

604
00:56:22.658 --> 00:56:23.726
And your boxers?

605
00:56:23.858 --> 00:56:26.195
Fireworks, dude?
Are you, like, 12?

606
00:56:29.431 --> 00:56:30.832
But...

607
00:56:30.966 --> 00:56:32.434
But I love you!

608
00:56:38.073 --> 00:56:40.842
Pick up.

609
00:56:40.976 --> 00:56:43.245
<i>This is Captain James Baker.
Please leave a message.</i>

610
00:56:43.379 --> 00:56:46.415
Dad. Call me.
I need to talk to you.

611
00:56:46.548 --> 00:56:48.050
It's important.

612
00:56:56.492 --> 00:56:59.428
Fuck it. It's time.

613
00:57:00.596 --> 00:57:01.897
Finally.

614
00:57:03.365 --> 00:57:04.400
Come on.

615
00:57:15.077 --> 00:57:16.211
Hey.

616
00:57:16.345 --> 00:57:17.479
Look at me.

617
00:57:17.613 --> 00:57:20.616
Look at me.

618
00:57:20.749 --> 00:57:22.918
Have I ever let you down?

619
00:57:23.052 --> 00:57:25.554
Pills or no pills?

620
00:57:28.257 --> 00:57:30.025
No.

621
00:57:30.159 --> 00:57:32.027
...problem.
What are you worried about?

622
00:57:32.161 --> 00:57:34.229
Lighten up. Have a bit of fun.

623
00:57:35.497 --> 00:57:38.033
For my brother, man.
You gotta take it cool.

624
00:57:38.167 --> 00:57:39.902
Brother, shmother.

625
00:57:40.035 --> 00:57:42.805
Let's just fucking
have a bit of a laugh, eh?

626
00:57:42.938 --> 00:57:44.239
Fuck it.

627
00:58:39.862 --> 00:58:42.431
Hey, y'all. I'm here
for the mÃ©nage Ã  trois!

628
00:58:45.901 --> 00:58:47.269
Stop!

629
00:58:49.405 --> 00:58:51.306
What? Who the fuck?

630
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.609
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut the fuck up!

631
00:58:53.742 --> 00:58:55.244
What? Run!

632
00:58:55.377 --> 00:58:56.645
- No!
- Run!

633
00:58:56.779 --> 00:58:57.980
No!

634
00:58:58.714 --> 00:59:01.116
- Run!
- No! No!

635
00:59:03.452 --> 00:59:05.621
Another one
hits the dust.

636
00:59:05.754 --> 00:59:07.689
No!

637
00:59:08.657 --> 00:59:10.058
No!

638
00:59:10.959 --> 00:59:12.628
You're a sick fuck,
you know that?

639
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:14.530
No!

640
00:59:17.266 --> 00:59:19.468
Really?
Aren't you gonna tell me?

641
00:59:20.702 --> 00:59:22.237
He's playing hard to get.

642
00:59:22.971 --> 00:59:25.073
- So annoying.
- I know.

643
00:59:26.775 --> 00:59:27.843
Where's Tom?

644
00:59:27.976 --> 00:59:29.578
He went outside to pee.

645
00:59:29.711 --> 00:59:32.281
- Why didn't he just use the bathroom?
- Boys.

646
00:59:32.414 --> 00:59:34.049
He's been gone
for a while now.

647
00:59:34.183 --> 00:59:37.686
Hey, hey. Party's over.
Go home, go home.

648
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.087
We need to talk.

649
00:59:57.406 --> 00:59:58.440
Hey.

650
00:59:59.374 --> 01:00:02.411
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm here for the party.

651
01:00:03.812 --> 01:00:06.315
You dirty bastard!

652
01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.151
Fuck!

653
01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:12.554
Keep that in your pants
next time!

654
01:00:13.021 --> 01:00:14.256
Fuck!

655
01:00:14.857 --> 01:00:15.858
Oh.

656
01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:18.060
Pretty thoughtful,
a refreshment.

657
01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:22.130
Not bad, son. Not bad.

658
01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:23.765
Off to the party.

659
01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.709
Nobody fucking move!

660
01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:35.777
- Who the hell are...
- Sebastian!

661
01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:39.781
You psycho piece of shit!

662
01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:42.150
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

663
01:00:42.284 --> 01:00:44.353
Why did you do that?

664
01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:45.922
It helps.

665
01:00:52.661 --> 01:00:55.130
You could've fucking
shot me, man!

666
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:10.980
Can't leave
the ladies waiting.

667
01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:18.587
Matthew.

668
01:01:19.755 --> 01:01:23.191
Why don't you come over here
and help me clean this shit up?

669
01:01:37.773 --> 01:01:40.676
Could you answer that?
That's Natalie.

670
01:01:40.809 --> 01:01:42.045
Okay.

671
01:01:42.177 --> 01:01:43.178
Hello?

672
01:01:43.312 --> 01:01:46.682
Dad! Dad, you have to come home.

673
01:01:47.449 --> 01:01:48.717
Hello?

674
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.218
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Dad! Dad!

675
01:01:50.352 --> 01:01:52.187
<i>Hey, Nat, I can't hear you.
I'll call you back</i>

676
01:01:52.321 --> 01:01:54.389
- <i>when I can get some reception.</i>
- Fuck! Fuck!

677
01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.392
Hello?

678
01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.462
- Try again.
- No service.

679
01:02:07.302 --> 01:02:09.271
Daddy, Daddy.

680
01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:12.274
<i>Hi, this is Lisa.
You missed me.</i>

681
01:02:12.407 --> 01:02:14.209
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

682
01:02:14.343 --> 01:02:16.345
Dad! Dad, you need to come home.

683
01:02:16.478 --> 01:02:18.347
There's some guys in the house.

684
01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:21.817
Dad, please hurry! There's...

685
01:02:21.951 --> 01:02:24.419
Ah! The bedroom.

686
01:02:58.253 --> 01:02:59.889
There you are!

687
01:03:07.596 --> 01:03:10.933
- I'll be your daddy!
- No, no, no!

688
01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:13.435
No! No!

689
01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:28.583
Finally, some reception.

690
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:31.787
<i>Dad!
Dad, you need to come home.</i>

691
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:35.024
<i>There's some guys</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

692
01:03:35.158 --> 01:03:37.292
<i>Dad, please hurry! There's...</i>

693
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:39.361
<i>I see them.</i>

694
01:03:39.494 --> 01:03:41.563
<i>There you are!</i>

695
01:03:44.232 --> 01:03:46.301
<i>It was my mistake.</i>

696
01:03:50.338 --> 01:03:52.240
What's wrong?

697
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:56.445
Leather.

698
01:03:56.578 --> 01:03:59.015
The smell. You're here.

699
01:03:59.148 --> 01:04:00.849
What happened, James?

700
01:04:02.684 --> 01:04:03.719
Babe.

701
01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:07.355
<i>Dad! Dad,
you need to come home.</i>

702
01:04:07.489 --> 01:04:09.591
<i>There's some guys
in the house.</i>

703
01:04:10.425 --> 01:04:11.928
<i>Dad, please hurry! There's...</i>

704
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:13.361
- This is real?
- Yeah.

705
01:04:13.495 --> 01:04:14.563
You can hear this?

706
01:04:14.696 --> 01:04:17.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What... Okay...

707
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.234
What...

708
01:04:20.802 --> 01:04:22.972
- Call Sebastian!
- I'm calling Sebastian.

709
01:04:24.907 --> 01:04:26.708
He's not answering.

710
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.412
We gotta turn back.

711
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.983
Stop the car
and let me drive.

712
01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.559
We need to call the cops!

713
01:04:44.693 --> 01:04:47.729
Cops get
hostages killed. Get in.

714
01:06:09.711 --> 01:06:11.713
We got a fucking problem.

715
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:13.883
This doesn't look
like a problem.

716
01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:16.751
Yeah, it's a fucking problem.

717
01:06:16.886 --> 01:06:19.088
Because we don't have
Johnny's ring.

718
01:06:19.222 --> 01:06:22.291
Who gives a shit about a ring
when you got all this money?

719
01:06:22.424 --> 01:06:24.260
It's his fucking
dead wife's ring.

720
01:06:24.392 --> 01:06:26.628
She died when he
was overseas.

721
01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:28.965
And we're
a hundred grand short.

722
01:06:31.433 --> 01:06:34.402
I'll find the money,
you find the ring.

723
01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:39.041
- Yeah.
- Come on.

724
01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:43.079
It's the only fucking
thing he has left of her.

725
01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:55.557
Where's the money?

726
01:06:59.028 --> 01:07:00.562
You live here, right?

727
01:07:01.496 --> 01:07:04.333
Tell me where the money is.

728
01:07:04.466 --> 01:07:06.002
I swear, I only took
a few hundred.

729
01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:08.905
No, no, there's more
than a few hundred missing.

730
01:07:10.139 --> 01:07:11.439
All right, listen.

731
01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:14.409
I don't wanna hurt you, okay?
I don't.

732
01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:16.178
But my brother and Dominic

733
01:07:16.312 --> 01:07:18.513
won't think twice about puttin'
a fucking bullet in your head.

734
01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:22.550
They're upstairs right now doing God
knows what with your fucking sister.

735
01:07:23.718 --> 01:07:25.553
One more chance.

736
01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:28.124
Where's the money?

737
01:08:22.577 --> 01:08:24.046
Get the fuck off!

738
01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:04.819
Hey.

739
01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:08.857
Hey, Johnny.

740
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.928
<i>It's Matthew, man. He's, uh...</i>

741
01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:18.566
He got fucked up, bro.

742
01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:20.602
<i>What?</i>

743
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.942
Holy shit.

744
01:09:44.026 --> 01:09:47.828
What are you fucking smirking
at, you fucking scrawny prick?

745
01:09:56.939 --> 01:09:59.141
Your sister's
a fucking fat cow.

746
01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:04.346
All right.
Let's go, motherfucker.

747
01:10:06.048 --> 01:10:07.083
Come on.

748
01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:15.757
Ray. Come on now, Ray!

749
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:18.160
Who's a faggot right now,
you skinny prick?

750
01:10:32.942 --> 01:10:35.177
Come on. Hit that fucking
fat bastard!

751
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.769
Come on. Lay that
motherfucker out!

752
01:11:14.984 --> 01:11:17.353
Fuck! Are you fucking
kidding me?

753
01:11:17.486 --> 01:11:19.488
I know.
It's been a little bit too long.

754
01:11:19.622 --> 01:11:21.924
I know. Come here!
Hey, brother.

755
01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:24.026
You always knew
how to make an entrance.

756
01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.861
Oh, shit, wow.
It's good to see ya.

757
01:11:26.996 --> 01:11:28.696
What's going on over here?

758
01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:33.435
Remember my little brother Ray?
He ain't so little anymore.

759
01:11:47.116 --> 01:11:48.450
Come on!

760
01:11:53.022 --> 01:11:54.456
Hey, Ray.

761
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:55.558
Hey, Ray!

762
01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:56.758
Ray.

763
01:11:56.892 --> 01:11:58.693
- Remember me?
- What's up, amigo?

764
01:11:58.826 --> 01:12:00.996
Hey, you ain't skinny
little Ray no more!

765
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:02.965
- Look at your ass, man.
- How you been?

766
01:12:03.098 --> 01:12:04.832
Wow. You been taking care
of your little brother?

767
01:12:04.967 --> 01:12:08.304
Oh, yeah.
He's doing good, man.

768
01:12:08.437 --> 01:12:10.239
- Still fightin' every day, huh?
- I'm tryin'.

769
01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.908
Fuckin'-A.
Gotta do something for a living.

770
01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:16.378
So, listen, you ain't exactly
supposed to be here.

771
01:12:16.512 --> 01:12:19.348
You just got out. This is
the last place you should be.

772
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:21.183
Yeah.

773
01:12:22.017 --> 01:12:25.387
Oh, shit, you know.
Shit went sideways.

774
01:12:25.521 --> 01:12:27.022
Matthew got killed.

775
01:12:27.923 --> 01:12:30.226
Matthew?
Your brother Matthew?

776
01:12:30.725 --> 01:12:31.660
When?

777
01:12:31.793 --> 01:12:33.462
Who killed Matthew?

778
01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:36.232
Let's go. We got some
business to take care of.

779
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.634
Come on, come on.

780
01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.034
<i>Is this Daddy?</i>

781
01:14:52.167 --> 01:14:53.736
Who the fuck is this?

782
01:14:53.868 --> 01:14:55.904
<i>I swear to God, man,</i>

783
01:14:57.039 --> 01:14:59.141
you put one hand
on my daughters,

784
01:14:59.274 --> 01:15:01.343
I will fucking make sure
you die.

785
01:15:01.477 --> 01:15:04.279
Well, it's a little too late
for that.

786
01:15:08.283 --> 01:15:09.585
Here's the deal.

787
01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:12.855
You walk away right now,
and I won't kill you.

788
01:15:12.988 --> 01:15:16.392
Well, like I said, you're just
gonna have to kill me then, boy.

789
01:15:16.525 --> 01:15:18.527
<i>You got something
that belongs to me.</i>

790
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:36.578
Baby, don't worry.

791
01:15:36.712 --> 01:15:39.281
I'll get our daughters,
and I'll make this motherfucker pay.

792
01:15:39.415 --> 01:15:41.850
Are you sure
it's not gonna...

793
01:15:41.984 --> 01:15:44.286
No. I'm built for this.

794
01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:46.890
It's civilian life
I'm not used to.

795
01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:49.558
- Okay.
- You still have the gun in the house?

796
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:50.894
I got rid of it.

797
01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:52.528
Shit.

798
01:15:53.028 --> 01:15:54.229
Fuck.

799
01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:56.031
Don't worry.

800
01:15:56.765 --> 01:15:58.534
I'll get this motherfucker.

801
01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.488
Shit! Get the fuck in here!

802
01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:21.123
Where is it?

803
01:16:22.858 --> 01:16:24.593
Enough with the games,
sweetheart.

804
01:16:25.761 --> 01:16:27.196
Give it up.

805
01:16:30.532 --> 01:16:32.936
Today! Come on.

806
01:17:18.113 --> 01:17:21.416
Let's go. Come on.
Get the fuck out! Move!

807
01:17:47.142 --> 01:17:49.511
Okay, babe.
I'm gonna go in from here.

808
01:17:50.812 --> 01:17:53.315
- You stay outta sight, okay?
- Okay, babe.

809
01:17:54.616 --> 01:17:55.784
Be safe.

810
01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:14.636
Did you see that?

811
01:18:15.704 --> 01:18:17.372
I don't see shit.

812
01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:19.808
I'm gonna check it out.

813
01:18:42.664 --> 01:18:44.700
Hey, what's going
on back there?

814
01:19:33.382 --> 01:19:36.518
I think I'm gonna go outside
and check on the boys.

815
01:19:37.586 --> 01:19:39.821
Well, I hope you're
fucking quick about it.

816
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:29.906
Shit.

817
01:20:38.047 --> 01:20:39.916
Shit, shit, shit.

818
01:20:44.286 --> 01:20:46.788
All right, let's find
the rest of it.

819
01:20:53.729 --> 01:20:54.830
Yeah?

820
01:20:56.264 --> 01:20:57.699
You're kiddin' me.

821
01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:01.603
All right, I'll be right there.

822
01:21:01.737 --> 01:21:02.972
Shit.

823
01:21:11.446 --> 01:21:12.614
Dad!

824
01:21:21.523 --> 01:21:24.493
- Where's your sister?
- She's upstairs with them.

825
01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:26.896
Okay. Where's Sebastian?

826
01:21:27.029 --> 01:21:27.997
They killed him.

827
01:21:28.131 --> 01:21:30.465
They stabbed him
over and over.

828
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.634
My friends!

829
01:21:32.768 --> 01:21:35.938
- How many are there?
- Like five or six.

830
01:21:36.072 --> 01:21:38.207
Okay. Your mother's
waiting in the car.

831
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:40.542
I want you to run
as fast as you can.

832
01:21:42.044 --> 01:21:43.545
Go, now.

833
01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:09.105
All right,
they're here.

834
01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:12.641
Let's go.
Let's kill 'em all.

835
01:22:12.774 --> 01:22:13.708
You got it.

836
01:22:13.842 --> 01:22:16.411
Get this shit
and get out of here.

837
01:22:34.063 --> 01:22:35.730
Missed me,
motherfucker!

838
01:22:50.812 --> 01:22:52.081
Oh, God!

839
01:23:48.603 --> 01:23:50.139
Oh, shit!

840
01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.156
Motherfucker!
Move the fuck... Come on!

841
01:24:09.358 --> 01:24:11.994
Fuckin' bitch!
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

842
01:24:12.128 --> 01:24:13.495
Don't fucking move!

843
01:24:13.628 --> 01:24:15.097
Gun down!

844
01:24:15.231 --> 01:24:17.266
I said put the fucking gun down!

845
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:21.070
It'd be a real shame
to put a hole

846
01:24:21.203 --> 01:24:23.172
in her pretty little face,
wouldn't it?

847
01:24:27.809 --> 01:24:29.611
You killed
my fucking brother.

848
01:24:29.744 --> 01:24:32.048
Know what the difference is
between you and me?

849
01:24:38.054 --> 01:24:40.122
I got nothin' to...

850
01:24:46.228 --> 01:24:47.495
It's okay.

851
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:49.631
It's okay. Okay.

852
01:24:50.832 --> 01:24:54.971
Sweetie, sweetie.
Listen. Listen.

853
01:24:55.104 --> 01:24:56.906
I'm gonna need you
to be strong, okay?

854
01:24:57.039 --> 01:24:59.708
Now, your mother's downstairs.
I need you to go to her.

855
01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:01.876
- No.
- Yes, and I want you to use this,

856
01:25:02.011 --> 01:25:03.845
if you need to, to get away.
You can do it.

857
01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.581
- Dad, no.
- Baby, baby, just go downstairs.

858
01:25:06.715 --> 01:25:08.084
You can do it.
You can do it.

859
01:25:08.217 --> 01:25:09.452
- Okay?
- Okay.

860
01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:12.021
Are you ready? Okay.
Go to your mom, all right?

861
01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.222
Go on.
You can do it.

862
01:25:13.356 --> 01:25:15.590
Go ahead, baby.
All right.

863
01:25:21.964 --> 01:25:22.999
Hey, Johnny!

864
01:25:26.268 --> 01:25:27.836
It's James.

865
01:25:28.803 --> 01:25:30.872
It's just you
and me now.

866
01:25:33.342 --> 01:25:34.809
Are you listening
to me?

867
01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:37.712
Let's make a deal.

868
01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:42.151
I know what you want.

869
01:25:43.219 --> 01:25:46.022
I'm comin' in.
Don't shoot.

870
01:25:56.332 --> 01:25:57.665
Drop that shit.

871
01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:02.104
Don't worry.

872
01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:05.241
Some things bullets
won't satisfy.

873
01:26:23.725 --> 01:26:25.294
Hey, we could make a plan.

874
01:26:39.707 --> 01:26:41.576
All right, motherfucker.

875
01:26:44.346 --> 01:26:46.182
<i>This is for my wife</i>

876
01:26:47.849 --> 01:26:49.919
<i>and my daughters...</i>

877
01:26:51.887 --> 01:26:53.688
<i>and Sebastian!</i>

878
01:26:54.323 --> 01:26:55.991
You gotta go.

879
01:26:57.193 --> 01:26:59.061
I wouldn't do that.

880
01:27:07.303 --> 01:27:08.471
Shoot him.

881
01:27:09.238 --> 01:27:11.974
Goddamn it, motherfucker,
shoot him!

882
01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:15.945
You work for me.
Shoot him!

883
01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:19.281
I don't think
you're getting it, Johnny.

884
01:27:19.415 --> 01:27:22.717
I think that silencer says
he works for himself.

885
01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:24.086
Ain't that right?

886
01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.422
That's not
a department-issue gun, is it?

887
01:27:26.555 --> 01:27:30.259
And that's your money he's got
right there in that bag, Johnny.

888
01:27:30.392 --> 01:27:32.027
Am I right?

889
01:27:33.195 --> 01:27:36.098
With everybody dead,
you get all the money.

890
01:27:36.232 --> 01:27:38.300
All you gotta do
is kill one more.

891
01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:42.770
But if you kill me, there's
gonna be an investigation.

892
01:27:42.905 --> 01:27:44.839
But if you take out
poor Johnny here,

893
01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:47.276
well, the good guys win.

894
01:27:48.077 --> 01:27:50.579
"Local sheriff
and DEA agent take out

895
01:27:50.712 --> 01:27:53.048
criminal home invaders."

896
01:27:53.182 --> 01:27:56.818
All we gotta do is figure out
how to split up the money.

897
01:27:56.952 --> 01:27:59.955
The money that nobody
but you and me knows about.

898
01:28:03.858 --> 01:28:06.028
You piece of shit,
I'll kill you!

899
01:28:11.367 --> 01:28:14.203
Now, let's talk
about that deal.

900
01:28:16.871 --> 01:28:19.774
Sheriff.

901
01:28:22.645 --> 01:28:24.413
I see you found our gun.

902
01:28:25.381 --> 01:28:26.916
Among other things.

903
01:29:22.832 --> 01:29:27.832
