00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.125
Okay, Ray,

4
00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.166
you are an incarcerated volunteer
in the Spiderhead clinical trial program.

5
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.208
Before we begin,
I need your permission to administer G-46.

6
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:32.208
-Drip on?
-Acknowledge.

7
00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.958
What was the ghost's favorite fruit?

8
00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:42.875
Boo-berry.

9
00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.583
No shit, that's funny.

10
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.708
What did the magician say
to the fisherman?

11
00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:03.291
Pick a cod, any cod.

12
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.083
What do you call
cheese that isn't yours?

13
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.000
Nacho cheese.

14
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:26.291
All right, Ray, Ray, these next ones
aren't jokes, more just facts, okay?

15
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:27.375
Oh, yeah?

16
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.958
In the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
over 800,000 people died.

17
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:50.791
You are serving…

18
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.666
You're serving
four consecutive life sentences

19
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.208

Another beautiful morning, friends,

52
00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.541
time to rise and really shine.

53
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:47.791
As volunteers in the Spiderhead
Penitentiary and Research Center…

54
00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.208
…you must do your part
and practice the golden rules,

55
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:55.041
no abuse, physical, verbal, or otherwise
and label your food in the fridge.

56
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.000
Jeff, please report to the dock
for remote field testing.

57
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.083
Okay, Jeff, we have
a new compound for you today.

58
00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.208
-Drip on?
-If it's N-31.

59
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.375
Hilarious, N-40. Acknowledge?

60
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.250
Acknowledge.

61
00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:28.875
Yeah, whenever you're ready, Jeff.

62
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.166
It's really nice.

63
00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.416
Oh, boy. Okay if we pep up
your language centers, Jeff?

64
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.333
Drip on?

65
00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:50.041
-Sure.
-Acknowledge?

66
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.791
Oh, sorry. Yeah, acknowledge.

67
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:04.458
Whoa.

68
00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:09.708
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

69
00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.166
Party's here.

70
00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.833
-Such a creep.

71
00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.500
-Where you been?
-Field trip.

72
00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:27.250
Oh, right, your phone call with Emma.

73
00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:28.916
No, uh, drug study.

74
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.541
N-40, I think.

75
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.958
They have everyone
on these field trips but me.

76
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:35.958
You're still new.

77
00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.833
I'm not that new.
You know, I'd love some sunshine.

78
00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.166
Can I help you with the…

79
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.333
Nectarines and prosciutto?

80
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:46.791
What you gonna help with?
I'm done. You're late.

81
00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.916
Open up.

82
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Enjoy that. Get it all.

83
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.458
-Yeah.
-It's really good.

84
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:54.875
-Good, right?
-I hope they keep you on snack.

85
00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.583
I always said they wasted
your talents on janitorial.

86
00:06:57.666 --> 00:07:00.500
Don't be too sure about that.
I've got a bit of a scrub fetish.

87
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.875
-Okay.
-Hey…

88
00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:07.083
-Did you notice we kinda--
-Finish each other's sentences?

89
00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:09.541
I was gonna say, need new bowls.

90
00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.083
Uh…

91
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.000
So, how was the N-40?

92
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:24.458
{\an8}Flowers didn't grow…

93
00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:30.916
They were sculpted. Painted.

94
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:39.000
I mean, I would tell you about it,
but I'm just coming down off the--

95
00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:40.500
-Verbaluce.
-Yeah.

96
00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:44.208
That tip-of-the-tongue feeling
when you can't find the right word

97
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:47.125
and you feel like
you'll never find the right word again?

98
00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:48.041
Yeah.

99
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:51.416
Well, you're cute when you're stupid.

100
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:56.875
Okay, but it sucks
because today was the day that…

101
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.208
There was something that
I was gonna tell you today, Lizzy.

102
00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:08.625
Okay, well, we got time.

103
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.291
Yes, we do.

104
00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:12.875
All we've got is time.

105
00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:17.458
Okay.

106
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.958
What you know about this?

107
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.458
You know nothing about this.

108
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.166
So, to sum up…

109
00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:36.832
I love it.

110
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.541

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.500

Jeff, Heather. Heather, Jeff.

151
00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:13.041
For the record, either prior to or during
your incarceration here at Spiderhead,

152
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.500
have you two ever spoken?

153
00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:16.250
-No.

154
00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:19.250
Ever interacted in any way?

155
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.291
Did I not just say no?

156
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.375
No.

157
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.291
So, what do you think?

158
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.750
Who are you asking?

159
00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.833
I'm asking both of you.
Let's start with Jeff.

160
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.791
Yeah, she seems nice.

161
00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.541
You like that word, but no,
I mean, how attractive is she?

162
00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.500
What, Steve,
you can't see it for yourself?

163
00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:48.125
Can you shut up, please?
I'm asking Jeff. How's she looking?

164
00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.833
Come on, man.

165
00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:51.958
-A scale of one to ten?
-Um…

166
00:12:52.791 --> 00:12:55.333
Yeah, she's a seven and a half.

167
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.666
And, Heather?

168
00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:02.416
He's all right. A five on a good day.

169
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.666
-Did you give her Honest-Ease?

170
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.708
No, I would have to ask. You know.

171
00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:10.416
I'm just kind of a bitch.

172
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.500
Oh.

173
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.875
Well, then I would like
to change my vote to an eight.

174
00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.583
All right, uh, Jeff, Heather,

175
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:20.583
can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

176
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:22.333
Acknowledge.

177
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:24.291
-Uh, yeah.
-Heather?

178
00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:26.833
God, she's a pain in the ass.

179
00:13:26.916 --> 00:13:29.375
-Acknowledge.
-Thank you.

180
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.583
Come on, guys.
Words, words, words.

181
00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:49.541
Okay, yeah,
she's starting to look pretty good.

182
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:51.458
Oh, my…

183
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.000
Yeah, she's…
She's looking really, really good.

184
00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.333
Heather?

185
00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.541
Uh, same. Yeah.

186
00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:16.750
Okay, pump up the Verbaluce,
let's get 'em talking.

187
00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:19.833
{\an8}

188
00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:22.958
Oh, God, she's so beautiful.

189
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:26.083
Yeah, don't tell us, tell each other.

190
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.000
You're… Oh, my God.

191
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.875
You're stunning,
you're gorgeous.

192
00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.708
{\an8}Sorry, I didn't see it before.

193
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:36.833
{\an8}It's okay, you're the most beautiful woman
I think I've ever seen in my life.

194
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:37.958
Thank you.

195
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:39.000
Wow.

196
00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:40.333
-Yeah.
-I could, uh…

197
00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:41.666
-Yeah?
-I could…

198
00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.958
You could what, Jeff?

199
00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:00.083
Oh, yeah.

200
00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.291
Are we getting this?

201
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.458
-Oh, yeah.

202
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.083
-Oh, my God.

203
00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:27.916
You okay?

204
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.583
Oh.

205
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.833
What's so funny?

206
00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:40.916
Nothing.

207
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.125
I didn't think it was possible.

208
00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:56.583
What?

209
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:59.541
-I'm liking cuddling.

210
00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:02.791
Please send me home
with some of this shit.

211
00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:03.875
Heather…

212
00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:06.875
Yes?

213
00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:12.916
I love you.

214
00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.916
Holy shit.

215
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.041
I love you too.

216
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:20.791
N-fucking-40, baby.

217
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.666
Yeah, God damn, we're good.

218
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.833
The love drug.

219
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:25.750
Gold star?

220
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:27.791
Not yet, not yet. No, no.

221
00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:30.833
We're less interested in
what we just saw than the residual effect.

222
00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:34.333
I realize you're stretched thin,
but I need you to observe these two.

223
00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:38.708
After they come down, in the next hours,
days, do they seek contact?

224
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:40.916
Profess feelings when
they're in the same room?

225
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.875
Do they communicate non-verbally?
Look for isopraxisms.

226
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:45.500
Uh, mirrored behaviors.

227
00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:48.000
People in love
unconsciously mimic each other's actions.

228
00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:51.333
They scratch their faces,
fiddle with their hair at the same time.

229
00:16:51.416 --> 00:16:53.291
It's like their bodies
can't help themselves.

230
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.041
So watch Jeff and Heather.

231
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.750
I want to know. I want to know, does love…

232
00:16:57.833 --> 00:16:59.875
Does this love last?

233
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.958
Hey, guys, thank you.

234
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.583
Thank you very much, no kidding.
We couldn't do it without you.

235
00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:09.208
Remember, what you're feeling,

236
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.958
the sometimes
disquieting transitions are natural.

237
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.500
We're bringing you back
to baseline. More to come.

238
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.375
Am I back on snack?

239
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.375
You don't
wanna know, trust me.

240
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.083
Me and the girls at the group home,

241
00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:26.665
we swiped lottery tickets
from convenience stores,

242
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.500
scratched them a hundred at a time.

243
00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:32.208
It looked like we were doing honest work,
you know, dirt under our nails.

244
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:36.458
It's not like we thought
stealing was bad, right?

245
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:38.875
No one needed it more than us
'cause we had nothin'.

246
00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.083
Yeah.

247
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:43.625
This one Christmas Eve,
we're drivin' through neighborhoods,

248
00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:44.958
everyone's at church.

249
00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:47.250
We're breaking windows,

250
00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.000
stealing presents from
under people's Christmas trees…

251
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:51.041
Here you go.

252
00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:52.958
Know what happens the next morning?

253
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:56.250
We're openin' up other people's sweaters,
The Grinch comes on TV.

254
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:57.208
Man.

255
00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:59.625
That part where
he gives back all the presents?

256
00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:01.125
-I felt so bad.
-Yeah, I bet.

257
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:03.000
I cried like a little punk-ass.

258
00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:32.333
♪ It's poetry in motion ♪

259
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:36.708
♪ And now she's making love to me ♪

260
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.666
♪ The spheres are in commotion ♪

261
00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:43.750
♪ The elements in harmony ♪

262
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.916
♪ She blinded me with science ♪

263
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.625
♪ She blinded me with science ♪

264
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:53.583
Afternoon, kids.

265
00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:58.291
Sarah, you know Jeff.
Jeff, you know Sarah.

266
00:18:58.916 --> 00:18:59.916
Hey.

267
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.500
Hey.

268
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.083
As you know,
we're wall-to-wall today.

269
00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:05.916
Boss man's breathing down our neck.

270
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.625
-So, if it's cool--
-Acknowledge.

271
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:16.708
Yeah, fine. Acknowledge.

272
00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:23.833
I can't watch.

273
00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:25.625
Sarah or the double dose?

274
00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:27.000
Sarah on the double dose.

275
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.375
We're all here by choice, Mark.

276
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:46.041
Is she…

277
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:47.833
Yeah, I think so.

278
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.958
-Yes! Yes!

279
00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:02.208
What's up, Ray?

280
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.416
Someone wrote in shit
on the bathroom stall doors, that's what.

281
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.500
Gross.

282
00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:09.916
I'll find out who's shit-finger.
Hope it ain't you.

283
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500
It's not.

284
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.416
Damn, I will never be as good
at anything as you are with that.

285
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.583
-You like that?
-Yeah.

286
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:32.708
Hey, is there a drug
to make you forget shit?

287
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:34.083
Yeah, it's called old age.

288
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.416
I'm looking forward to it.

289
00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.041
How you feeling?

290
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:49.500
I'm all right. A little sore.

291
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.458
It must've felt pretty good
at the time though.

292
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.250
Yeah.

293
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.250
-We can get you some cream for that.

294
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.791
I'm fine. Thanks, though.

295
00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:03.916
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

296
00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:08.375
While we're at it, try not to let
the girls touch your MobiPak.

297
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.541
And don't… And don't touch theirs. Okay?

298
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:14.958
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

299
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.208
they can flood.

300
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:17.625
You could lose control.

301
00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:19.333
Cool.

302
00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:23.583
Uh, hey, Mark?

303
00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:24.875
Yeah?

304
00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.416
Can you take me off snack?

305
00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:30.458
Was something wrong? Problems with Lizzy?

306
00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.916
Nah, just, I'm ready for a change.

307
00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:39.000
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:21:42.291 --> 00:21:43.291
Thanks, man.

309
00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:57.666
God damn it.

310
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:00.583
Oh, my God.

311
00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.541
Lizzy.

312
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:03.791
Is she from Seattle?

313
00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:05.958
Prescott, Arizona.

314
00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:08.625
Ah, see? Jeff knows.

315
00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:10.541
It's cool when folks get acquainted.

316
00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:12.750
Speaking of,
I saw the box scores this morning.

317
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:16.166
You Mariners are on a bit of a streak.
We should pipe in a game later, huh?

318
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.375
Yeah, that'd be great.
Who're they playing?

319
00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:20.625
Crap. Hey, Mark, return this.

320
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:24.541
Uh, Jeff, please take a seat.
Another full day ahead.

321
00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:27.500
If you could read the headlines,
you can't, but if you could,

322
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:29.583
the world needs our help more than ever.

323
00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.208
Now, we got two rooms running today.

324
00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:35.125
Pay no attention to Dave, trust me.

325
00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:36.583
Seriously, trust him.

326
00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:41.375
Jeff…

327
00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:45.708
All right. Recognize them?

328
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.416
That's very funny.

329
00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.958
I'm gonna present you with a choice.
This is what I'm after.

330
00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:53.583
-Mm-hmm.
-You see this remote?

331
00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:59.000
Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx,

332
00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:03.125
or you could slide this button
and Heather gets some Darkenfloxx.

333
00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:04.208
You see? You choose.

334
00:23:05.416 --> 00:23:07.833
-They have Darkenfloxx in their MobiPaks?

335
00:23:07.916 --> 00:23:08.916
Excuse me.

336
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.750
Hey, Dave, how you feeling?

337
00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.083
Hungry.

338
00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:25.125
-Could he be shit-finger?
-Yeah, maybe.

339
00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:27.625
All that food's
gotta go somewhere.

340
00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:29.541
Where were we? Darkenfloxx.

341
00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:33.208
Mark put it in the ladies' MobiPaks
in anticipation of this very study.

342
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:37.458
That make you feel uncomfortable?

343
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.416
A little.

344
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.041
Yeah? That's okay, it should.

345
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:43.166
But you know as well as I
it's just an agitator,

346
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.166
causes no permanent damage. All right?

347
00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.458
So what's your decision, Jeff?

348
00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:51.083
Is Heather getting
the Darkenfloxx or is Sarah?

349
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.583
I don't know, I can't say.

350
00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:58.041
Can't say or won't say?
You kinda have to, you know that.

351
00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:02.083
I mean, it's random if I do.

352
00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:04.125
You feel your decision would be random?

353
00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:05.208
Yeah.

354
00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:08.791
This is what we're testing for…

355
00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:11.500
Is any residual fondness with…
With the ladies.

356
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.875
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about Heather and Sarah?

357
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.875
How I feel?

358
00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.041
Maybe some Verbaluce?

359
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.083
No.

360
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:24.458
I mean, it's not that I like 'em both,
or that I like one more than the other.

361
00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:29.666
It's just, I… I just don't really feel
anything towards either of them, you know?

362
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.750
I mean, I can remember feeling
a certain way towards 'em,

363
00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:36.625
but that's all kind of
hazy and worn off now.

364
00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:40.708
And why such reluctance
to the Darkenfloxx then?

365
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:42.916
Because I was a part of I-16.

366
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:48.875
I mean, I know what it's like,
and you know what it's like.

367
00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:50.125
-It's…
-Yeah.

368
00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:51.375
It's… It's horrible.

369
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:55.041
And I just…
I don't want to do that to anyone.

370
00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:58.291
Look, I don't know. It's random.

371
00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:02.750
Okay. I'll tell you what.

372
00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:07.541
I'm giving
the Darkenfloxx to Heather. Okay?

373
00:25:11.791 --> 00:25:13.833
Actually, I'm gonna give it to Sarah.

374
00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:20.416
All right, Jeff, you've convinced me.

375
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:23.291
It would to you be random,
you truly have no preference.

376
00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:25.875
My preference is that nobody gets it.

377
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:27.083
That makes two of us.

378
00:25:27.166 --> 00:25:28.166
Three.

379
00:25:28.708 --> 00:25:30.041
See what we just did.

380
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:33.083
With your help, we learned
a lot more about N-40.

381
00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:35.583
"Luvactin," working title.

382
00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:38.083
So, no one's getting Darkenfloxx?

383
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.125
Not today.

384
00:25:39.208 --> 00:25:41.541
But we do need
to understand N-40 a bit better.

385
00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:44.333
For instance, uh,
what's the drug's duration?

386
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:46.625
What's the variable effect
of its dosage?

387
00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:49.458
You and Sarah were on double the dose
of you and Heather

388
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:52.333
and yet your feelings for the two women
are largely the same.

389
00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:54.041
Don't you find that interesting?

390
00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:56.166
Yeah.

391
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.208
Hey, uh, I, uh… I'm not one to bring
Darkenfloxx in any conversation,

392
00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:06.583
but we have to know more about N-40.
It could be a game-changer, Jeff.

393
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:09.416
The work we do
could help millions of people.

394
00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:12.083
You ever loved?

395
00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:16.416
Yeah.

396
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.875
Yeah, you were lucky. Not everyone can.

397
00:26:21.708 --> 00:26:25.125
You know that loneliness is as lethal
as smoking 15 cigarettes a day?

398
00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:26.708
Look it up.

399
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:30.791
Imagine if we could destroy
all the world's cigarettes.

400
00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:35.541
We'd have people everywhere loving,
being loved, capable of love,

401
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:38.708
and who would've made that possible?

402
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:40.875
-Gold star for me.
-Yeah.

403
00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:43.500
Yeah. And your new friend, N-40.
Yay for us.

404
00:26:43.583 --> 00:26:44.791
Yay.

405
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:49.083
Okay. Thank you, ladies.

406
00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:52.625
Excuse you, Jeff.

407
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.041
Hey. Everything okay?

408
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:03.583
Yeah.

409
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:07.875
They don't know how close
they came to getting Darkenfloxxed.

410
00:27:07.958 --> 00:27:09.500
Yeah, I know. I get it.

411
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:13.666
But listen, man, think if you'd had
the benefit of one of our products

412
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.166
before your fateful night…

413
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.791
What is it you want, Jeff,
more than anything in the world?

414
00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:24.208
To go back.

415
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.833
What you want is redemption.

416
00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.750
And this is how you're gonna find it.

417
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.750
Yeah, thanks.

418
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:23.541
Hey.

419
00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.166
Hey.

420
00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:26.875
Meatball?

421
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.291
Yeah, sure.

422
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:33.291
Ah, sorry.

423
00:28:35.708 --> 00:28:37.833
It's all right.
I suck at this game anyway.

424
00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:44.083
-Hey, I wanted to--
-Hey, Jeff.

425
00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.166
Ah, Free Fridays.

426
00:28:51.958 --> 00:28:52.958
Lucky.

427
00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:56.208
Say hi to the missus for me.

428
00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:24.375
Hi, it's Emma.
Leave a message or don't.

429
00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:29.583
Hey, babe, you're probably getting
sick of me leaving these things for you,

430
00:29:29.666 --> 00:29:35.500
but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you and I'm sorry.

431
00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:39.833
Something else I wanna tell you too.

432
00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:44.083
I, uh, met someone.
Yeah, her name's Lizzy.

433
00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:46.875
She kinda reminds me of you a little bit.

434
00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:52.208
So maybe I'll finally stop bugging you.

435
00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:56.208
This'll be my last, "I'm sorry."

436
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.375
Yeah, come in.

437
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.958
Ho, ho, ho!

438
00:30:28.958 --> 00:30:31.500
Merry Christmas, Lizzy.

439
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:34.041
-Have you been a nice girl?
-This is…

440
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.916
This is Santa?

441
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.500
Hello!

442
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:40.291
Thought this might cheer us up.

443
00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:41.666
{\an8}Aww. Wow.

444
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.833
{\an8}-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

445
00:30:43.916 --> 00:30:46.041
-Ew! Ugh!

446
00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:47.125
God.

447
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:50.166
It's not actually Christmas though, is it?

448
00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:51.916
October?

449
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.916
-Yeah, just a guess.
-Okay.

450
00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:57.125
I'd play "Jingle Bells,"
but we get this instead.

451
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.166
You know what? I'll make some eggnog.

452
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.125
-Mm.
-Yeah?

453
00:31:00.208 --> 00:31:03.666
-Ooh, Santa like eggnog.
-Not the Santa voice.

454
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.750
Hey, Rogan.

455
00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:19.458
Go fuck yourself.

456
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:40.125
No, no, no, no, no, no.

457
00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:42.375
-No way, guys. Come on.
-Just relax.

458
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:45.958
We know what it does. Okay?
We've all seen what it does.

459
00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:48.750
It's already proven.
This isn't some type of skin show.

460
00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:49.833
Tell 'em, Rogan.

461
00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:53.333
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
But fuck all y'all.

462
00:31:53.416 --> 00:31:56.750
-He has a future in greeting cards.
-I can fuckin' hear you!

463
00:31:56.833 --> 00:31:59.166
Guys, listen, listen to me, okay?

464
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.000
I've never been with a… Uh…

465
00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:03.583
No offense, man. If you have, that's fine.

466
00:32:03.666 --> 00:32:05.083
It's not my thing. Whatever.

467
00:32:05.166 --> 00:32:07.958
Look, Mark, I'm not recovered, man.

468
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:11.000
I asked for cream,
nobody brought me cream.

469
00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:12.875
So I'm not doing this. I won't.

470
00:32:12.958 --> 00:32:15.916
No, I'm not. No! No! No! No!

471
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.333
I'm not, I won't. I won't acknowledge.

472
00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:22.333
Jeff, chill pill. It isn't what
you think. No romance novels today.

473
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.416
Huh.

474
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:25.708
Your loss.

475
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.833
Funny.

476
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:40.583
That's it, guys. Thanks.

477
00:32:42.708 --> 00:32:44.541
What the fuck was that about?

478
00:32:58.208 --> 00:33:00.666
Ping-pong
tournament set for Saturday.

479
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.583
Please see Ray if you're interested.

480
00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:04.541
-Oh, hi, Jeff.
-Hey, Heather.

481
00:33:04.625 --> 00:33:05.541
It's not the time.

482
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:09.250
Did Mr. Abnesti ask you
who to Darkenfloxx, me or Rogan?

483
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:11.708
-He did present me with that dilemma--
-Heather.

484
00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:14.458
Did you recently have sex
with Rogan in addition to me

485
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.875
and fall in love with him
like you did with me?

486
00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:17.791
Jeff, come on.

487
00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:19.833
That's an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

488
00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.875
-Heather, put a sock in it.
-Okay.

489
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.291
Jeff, what are you doing?

490
00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:26.666
Now she's looking for her sock.
You get very literal on Verbaluce.

491
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.416
Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
Show yourself out, close the door.

492
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.625
-Okay.
-Well done.

493
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.958
Please show yourself out, thank you.

494
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.833
-Jesus Christ, Jeff. It's--
-Wow. Yeah.

495
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.083
What's going on, huh?

496
00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:43.958
-So everybody's just fucking everyone?
-Language.

497
00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:45.250
Everyone's fucking everyone.

498
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.583
-Relax.
-And being asked to Darkenfloxx everyone.

499
00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:48.875
It's experimental design.

500
00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:51.416
I don't make the rules,
it's the Protocol Committee.

501
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.791
Why don't you take a look? Look. Here.

502
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:56.416
Here you go. Huh?

503
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.041
{\an8}You think I want to do this?

504
00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.333
{\an8}Let me close the door.

505
00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:01.875
Mark, I mean, look, man,

506
00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:04.791
I've been on
some crazy-ass project teams, right?

507
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:07.666
But this one…
Yeah, this one doesn't feel right.

508
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.916
Jeff, you know,
I sympathize, but only to a point.

509
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.125
I gotta take off my friendship hat
for a second and remind you,

510
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:15.958
your presence in this facility,

511
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:19.375
while technically a punishment,
is a privilege. Is it not?

512
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:21.666
You applied for it,
you were approved for it.

513
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.958
You could as easily be
at State with the general pop

514
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.791
and you would be playing pitch-and-catch,

515
00:34:25.875 --> 00:34:27.666
in your case catch,
with the likes of Rogan.

516
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.875
You don't wanna know
what he did in his last prison.

517
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.916
And secondly,
our open-door policy is my greatest pride.

518
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.958
I can come visit you, you can visit me.

519
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:37.458
Even in my quarters
or up here in the Spiderhead.

520
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:41.208
No other penal institution in the world
boasts such a respectful relationship

521
00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:42.958
between the jailer and the jailed.

522
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:48.083
No bars, no guards, that's only possible
in a culture of mutual respect.

523
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:51.500
Okay? Mutual respect.
I don't burst in on you, do I?

524
00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:52.583
Huh?

525
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.916
-No.
-No.

526
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.833
So, you don't burst in on me.
We must honor that or it's my ass.

527
00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.583
Doors close, locks go on,

528
00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:03.166
suddenly we're no different
from anywhere else, you get it?

529
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.250
Yes.

530
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:06.875
Jesus, is it all that terrible here?

531
00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:10.666
Huh? I'm asking
'cause I've taken great pains, Jeff.

532
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:11.666
It's very nice.

533
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.333
The food, the ping-pong, arcade games,

534
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:16.958
freedom within reason
to move around as you please.

535
00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:18.541
I've insisted on that for you.

536
00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:20.916
I've flirted with violating
state compliance standards,

537
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.625
-at no small risk to me.
-I know.

538
00:35:22.708 --> 00:35:24.333
In front of my bosses, my boss' bosses.

539
00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:25.875
Back me up here, Mark.

540
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.958
-Hmm? Come on, say something.
-He's right.

541
00:35:32.416 --> 00:35:34.916
At least you could
return the sentiment.

542
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.166
It's the least you could do.

543
00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:40.625
I'm sorry.

544
00:35:42.666 --> 00:35:43.791
Okay? I…

545
00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:48.625
It's just, all this talk of Darkenfloxx,
it gets me on edge. Okay?

546
00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:53.083
I hate this, Jeff and I'm sorry. Okay?

547
00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:54.166
I just…

548
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.208
I need to know if we can count on you.

549
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:01.333
Can we count on you in the future
to honor our arrangement?

550
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:13.916
Hey, Sarah.

551
00:36:19.416 --> 00:36:22.791
This time, next week, we'll have
our last gold star, don't you think?

552
00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:27.041
Mark, smile once in a while, okay?
We're changing the world.

553
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:28.541
Yeah.

554
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.166
Not you too.

555
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:34.333
Listen, Darkenfloxx is a tool, okay?

556
00:36:34.416 --> 00:36:36.875
It's gonna help us figure out
the important shit.

557
00:36:36.958 --> 00:36:40.000
This time, next week,
right back in the drawer, I promise.

558
00:36:40.083 --> 00:36:42.416
Yeah? What?

559
00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:47.708
Well, just something Jeff said
about wanting a drug to forget.

560
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.375
You need to relax, okay?

561
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.166
Enjoy your weekend, Mark.

562
00:36:52.791 --> 00:36:54.541
Hit the mainland, clear your head.

563
00:36:54.625 --> 00:36:56.291
You need it. We both do.

564
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:59.208
Maybe wings, beer, Skee-Ball,
whatever you kids are into?

565
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:02.000
Yeah, um… Oh, I think Skee-Ball.

566
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:03.541
Okay.

567
00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:08.666

580
00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:38.166
I mean, it's hard to describe
without Verbaluce,

581
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:44.041
but just imagine
the worst you've ever felt times ten,

582
00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:48.250
and even that doesn't even
come close to it, honestly, I mean…

583
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.041
I felt like I was on fire.

584
00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:55.416
I wished I was on fire.

585
00:38:57.375 --> 00:39:01.166
I would have set myself on fire
to make it stop. It's horrible.

586
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.375
So they give this Darkenfloxx to someone?

587
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.958
I mean, not this time.

588
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.458
Well, that's good.

589
00:39:08.791 --> 00:39:10.583
Jesus, you're shaking.

590
00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:18.041
You're a good guy.

591
00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:31.416
Look, I heard from Mark
that you asked to be taken off snack.

592
00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:35.708
I assume that meant away from me, right?

593
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:38.375
It's 'cause of, uh…

594
00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:39.958
Emma?

595
00:39:40.458 --> 00:39:41.458
Yeah.

596
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:43.291
No, she's…

597
00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.500
She's moved on.

598
00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:51.583
It just helps to hear her voice sometimes.

599
00:39:52.875 --> 00:39:55.541
Yeah, I know.
Of course, I get it, you know.

600
00:39:59.666 --> 00:40:01.791
This place can really mess with your head.

601
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:09.166
I mean, they've been testing me up
and down a lot weirder stuff than usual.

602
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:13.625
It's just been really tough lately.

603
00:40:17.708 --> 00:40:21.041
Sometimes, it's hard to remember
who I was before I came in here.

604
00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:27.583
But, Lizzy…

605
00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:32.250
When I'm with you…

606
00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:37.083
that's the only time
I really feel like myself.

607
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:48.666
Hands up, Mark. Come on.
There you go.

608
00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:51.500
-So, I had a big idea for G-46.

609
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:53.000
Oh, yeah? What, Laffodil?

610
00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:55.250
Yes, uh, we sell it to comedy clubs.

611
00:40:56.041 --> 00:40:59.208
That's a little idea, Mark. No offense.

612
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:00.875
Offense kind of taken.

613
00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:02.416
Whoo-hoo!

614
00:41:04.041 --> 00:41:05.750
What do I keep saying to you, huh?

615
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:07.125
I don't know, "Shut up, Mark"?

616
00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:09.166
I say you gotta think huge.

617
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.041
You look at the world through
the wrong end of binoculars.

618
00:41:12.125 --> 00:41:14.208
That's weird. Don't be weird.

619
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.708
Hey, uh, what time do we start?

620
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:17.791
Ten minutes.

621
00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:20.875
Why don't you hit me? We got time.

622
00:41:20.958 --> 00:41:23.833
Come on, hit me. Let's go.

623
00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:29.500
-Two?
-Uh, make it three.

624
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.041
Remember, at least 12 hours apart.

625
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.125
Yeah, I've heard the dosing schedule.
Thank you.

626
00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:41.333
Say it. Come on,
you've been wanting to for a while.

627
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:42.416
Best shot.

628
00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:44.958
You of all people--

629
00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:46.625
Should understand the risks?

630
00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:48.000
That's what I'm trying to do.

631
00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:50.708
-We can assess risks without taking them.
-Oh, can I?

632
00:41:50.791 --> 00:41:52.791
Someone has to answer
for our products, Mark.

633
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:54.208
Doesn't that occur to you?

634
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:57.291
Life out there is not life in here, okay?
Shit is messy.

635
00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:00.375
It's out of our control.
This is new frontier stuff here.

636
00:42:00.958 --> 00:42:04.625
And when, not if, when one of
our compounds falls on its face,

637
00:42:04.708 --> 00:42:07.458
one of us has to stand
in front of a bereaved loved one,

638
00:42:07.541 --> 00:42:10.666
or Mike Wallace, or God forbid, a jury,
and answer for what we do.

639
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.083
What we made and bottled
and named and sold.

640
00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:14.250
Is that gonna be you?

641
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:15.958
No, it's gonna be the guy who can say,

642
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:18.750
"You're right I stand behind our shit.
I've taken it myself."

643
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:22.166
Mike Wallace is dead.

644
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.666
Really? Hard to keep track.
Ed Bradley then.

645
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:25.750
Also dead.

646
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.291
Morley Safer?

647
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.708
Shit. Better to think someone's dead,
and find out they're alive.

648
00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:35.541
Yeah, when you first hired me--

649
00:42:35.625 --> 00:42:37.583
Yeah, you disapproved. Duly noted.

650
00:42:37.666 --> 00:42:40.541
Hey, Jeff, how are you?

651
00:42:41.583 --> 00:42:43.166
-Hey.
-Sorry, I didn't mean to…

652
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.166
That's cool.
Maybe a bit of advance notice next time.

653
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.250
Sure.

654
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:48.916
Yeah, shall we?

655
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.250
Nobel Prize ain't gonna
win itself.

656
00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:53.041
Mark?

657
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:55.333
I'm gonna freshen up,
so be down in a second.

658
00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:04.833
Shit.

659
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.916
-Is Heather…
-On her way.

660
00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:15.625
Beautiful people get away with too much.

661
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:18.375
I say that having
benefited myself from time to time.

662
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:24.125
Heather, thanks for joining us.
Be right with you.

663
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:29.583
All right, uh, Jeff,
I want to start by apologizing.

664
00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:32.041
No, look,
I shouldn't have walked in on you.

665
00:43:32.125 --> 00:43:33.458
Oh. No, not that. Uh…

666
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.958
Remember the other day when I asked you

667
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:38.375
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to
and you said neither?

668
00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.250
Yeah.

669
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:43.750
That was good enough for me,
but apparently not the Protocol Committee.

670
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:45.875
-Mm-hmm.
-Three Horsemen of Anality.

671
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.250
They're not convinced
you don't have residual feelings

672
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:49.750
for Heather and Sarah.

673
00:43:49.833 --> 00:43:54.125
So, unfortunately today we gotta do
a kind of a confirmation trial.

674
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:56.625
This time per
the Protocol Committee, Mark,

675
00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:59.916
uh, instead of me asking you
which girl to give the Darkenfloxx to,

676
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.375
which the Protcom felt was,
they say, "too subjective,"

677
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:08.083
we're gonna give the girl
the Darkenfloxx and then see what you say.

678
00:44:08.166 --> 00:44:10.125
Once again on some Verbaluce.

679
00:44:10.666 --> 00:44:12.666
You refreshed his MobiPak?
His quantities good?

680
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.041
They are. Plus
I already told you they are.

681
00:44:16.125 --> 00:44:17.375
And what about Heather's?

682
00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:19.833
You stood right there
and watched me, Steve.

683
00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:22.708
That I did, Mark.

684
00:44:25.458 --> 00:44:27.125
Sorry, Jeff, we're a little tense today.

685
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.291
Not an easy day and everyone's
a little bit uncomfortable about this.

686
00:44:31.375 --> 00:44:33.416
I don't want you to Darkenfloxx Heather.

687
00:44:33.958 --> 00:44:34.833
Okay, good start.

688
00:44:34.916 --> 00:44:39.125
Uh, is that because you love her?
Feelings of love?

689
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:41.208
No, I mean, I already told you that.

690
00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:42.458
Yeah, uh, and I agreed,

691
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:46.166
but is this confirmation trial
about what you and I want?

692
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.083
Not so much.

693
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:50.333
What it is about
is about us recording what you say

694
00:44:50.416 --> 00:44:52.458
as you observe
Heather getting Darkenfloxxed

695
00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:53.791
for five minutes, that's all.

696
00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:55.666
One five-minute trial. Okay?

697
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.541
So, here we go with the Verbaluce.

698
00:44:58.625 --> 00:45:00.083
Drip on, Jeff?

699
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:04.416
Oh, come on, Jeff.

700
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.416
You should be flattered.
Did we choose Rogan?

701
00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:08.333
You're afraid of Rogan.

702
00:45:08.416 --> 00:45:11.083
Yeah, Rogan could kill you
with a box of Kleenex.

703
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:15.500
But no, we deemed your level of speaking
more commensurate with our data needs.

704
00:45:15.583 --> 00:45:16.583
Drip on?

705
00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:23.083
God, did you even know Heather's story?

706
00:45:23.166 --> 00:45:24.666
You don't. Legally, you can't.

707
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.958
But does it involve whiskey,
gangs, patricide? I can't say.

708
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:31.958
But can I imply that her past
did not exactly include a dog named Lassie

709
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:35.041
and a lot of family talks about the Bible
while grammy sat doing macramé?

710
00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:37.583
Can I suggest if… Mark, empty.

711
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.458
Can I suggest if you knew Heather's past,

712
00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:44.583
making her feel briefly sad,
nauseous, and/or horrified,

713
00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:47.166
it might not seem like
the worst idea in the world?

714
00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:50.666
I don't know.

715
00:45:51.833 --> 00:45:53.208
Am I a monster, Jeff?

716
00:45:53.833 --> 00:45:55.666
Do I remember birthdays around here?

717
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.666
Who took you up
in his seaplane that one time?

718
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.125
-You.
-Yeah. And when we had

719
00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:02.291
that outbreak of athlete's foot,
and your feet were rashed up,

720
00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:05.000
did a certain individual
rush to pick up a prescription,

721
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:07.583
paying for it with his own personal money?

722
00:46:07.666 --> 00:46:09.000
-That was nice.
-Yeah.

723
00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:10.958
Seems unprofessional to bring up now.

724
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:13.375
Come on, Jeff,
what do you want me to say here?

725
00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:15.541
Huh? Your Free Fridays are at risk?

726
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:18.125
Look,
I'm trying to help, Mr. Abnesti.

727
00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:19.208
Steve!

728
00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:26.458
Can you make a call for me?

729
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.333
Yeah, all right.

730
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:41.000
Let me give it a shot. Okay? BRB.

731
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:50.916
Lizzy.

732
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.166
Uh, Mr. Abnesti.

733
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.208
-My father in the room?
-Huh?

734
00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:56.333
Who am I kidding?
He split when I was eight.

735
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.041
Shit, man. I'm sorry.

736
00:46:59.541 --> 00:47:01.291
We're so happy to have you, Lizzy,

737
00:47:01.916 --> 00:47:04.416
and not just 'cause of
your culinary skills.

738
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.541
You won best brisket
at the Prescott Barbecue Festival,

739
00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.625
three years running?

740
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:10.833
How did you know that?

741
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.750
-It's my business to know.
-Wow.

742
00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:14.208
You know, myself,

743
00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:16.791
-I find brisket a little bit fibrous, but…
-Hmm.

744
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.000
Okay.

745
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.708
Did we snag you
those copper pots you're after?

746
00:47:23.958 --> 00:47:25.541
I've been meaning to thank you.

747
00:47:25.625 --> 00:47:27.583
Stop it, stop it, unnecessary.

748
00:47:27.666 --> 00:47:29.666
You've been such a welcome addition.

749
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.750
-It's the least I could do.
-Thank you.

750
00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:34.166
Mm.

751
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:37.291
In fact, you know, you made me feel, uh…

752
00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:40.125
Made me feel a little bit foolish.

753
00:47:40.916 --> 00:47:42.333
-Foolish?
-Yeah.

754
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:44.041
Just, you get someone's file

755
00:47:44.125 --> 00:47:47.333
and, uh, you form these preconceptions,
even when you know

756
00:47:47.416 --> 00:47:50.083
there were plenty of circumstances
and not so many fair shakes.

757
00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:51.708
You still judge.

758
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:55.541
Hmm.

759
00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.958
Anyone else here, um, know?

760
00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:04.166
Oh, no. Our little secret.

761
00:48:05.541 --> 00:48:06.541
Yeah.

762
00:48:09.666 --> 00:48:10.500
Whoo!

763
00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:14.416
This is good. A thousand copper pots
for Java like this.

764
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.666
Or maybe a field trip?
An Arizona girl-in-the-sunshine, huh?

765
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.083
Hi, Jeff. Uh…

766
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:30.333
I'm sorry, man.

767
00:48:30.958 --> 00:48:33.666
Unfortunately, the committee
was very firm.

768
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.125
They insisted the test must be
continued as scheduled.

769
00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:40.291
Otherwise, they're threatening
to remove you from this program

770
00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:41.791
and send you back to State.

771
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:46.916
They need you to acknowledge, Jeff.

772
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.541
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time. Drip on?

773
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.541
Yeah, acknowledge.

774
00:49:04.208 --> 00:49:05.208
Thank you.

775
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:13.916
Heather, hello again.

776
00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:16.666
Good morning, again.

777
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:17.750
Drip on?

778
00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:20.708
Acknowledge.

779
00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:22.583
Okay, Mark.

780
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:25.958
{\an8}-

781
00:49:40.833 --> 00:49:41.875
I don't like this.

782
00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:48.416
Please. It's hurting.

783
00:49:51.208 --> 00:49:52.583
What's wrong with me?

784
00:49:52.666 --> 00:49:55.125
-It can't hurt you.
-Shit.

785
00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:59.500
Jeff, speak a lot, in detail.
Let's make something useful with this.

786
00:50:05.583 --> 00:50:06.791
Heather just vomited.

787
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.791
She appears to be
in a highly aversive state.

788
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:11.583
Why don't you back us up?
What happened first?

789
00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:12.916
She started to cry.

790
00:50:14.583 --> 00:50:16.625
She seems confused by how she's feeling.

791
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.541
Now she's crying harder.
She seems unable to sit still.

792
00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:22.875
And what are you feeling?

793
00:50:25.958 --> 00:50:28.666
-Melancholy. Culpability.
-Oh, no, please.

794
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.000
Mm-hmm.

795
00:50:30.083 --> 00:50:31.083
Go on.

796
00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:33.333
No, no, no.

797
00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:35.583
All I can think
is Heather was once a child.

798
00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:39.083
-Loved by her mother and father…

799
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.083
…neither foreseeing that
one day she might do a terrible thing.

800
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:47.458
A thing that would separate her
once and for all from love.

801
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:49.041
Good, go on.

802
00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:52.916
Divorce her from joy
and cause her unspeakable sadness.

803
00:50:57.416 --> 00:50:58.958
And do you love her?

804
00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:03.708
Help! Please! Please!

805
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:06.958
No.

806
00:51:11.041 --> 00:51:12.250
Hang in there, Jeff.

807
00:51:12.333 --> 00:51:14.208
Hey, Mark. Any vestige of romantic love

808
00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:16.041
-in Jeff's words?

809
00:51:16.125 --> 00:51:17.208
-No.
-Great.

810
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:19.958
-Just basic human feeling.

811
00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:21.083
Excellent.

812
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:22.166
-Steve.

813
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.375
{\an8}-Mm?
-I think it's flooding.

814
00:51:24.458 --> 00:51:25.458
Get back!

815
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:26.375
Back off.

816
00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:28.791
-I did. The effects not--

817
00:51:28.875 --> 00:51:29.958
Try more red.

818
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:32.666
Heather is in great torment.

819
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.083
-Back it off.
-It's not working.

820
00:51:35.166 --> 00:51:38.958
Heather, listen to me. Sit down,
don't raise a finger, that's an order.

821
00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:40.375
Get away from me, please!

822
00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:42.458
-Are you kidding me?

823
00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:44.083
{\an8}Are you fucking kidding me?

824
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:45.583
Jesus.

825
00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:47.041
This is bad. Get in there, go.

826
00:51:48.833 --> 00:51:49.666
Shit.

827
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.875
Heather's destroying everything
within reach.

828
00:51:51.958 --> 00:51:53.041
Sit down.
That is an order.

829
00:51:53.958 --> 00:51:55.208
I'm responsible.

830
00:51:55.916 --> 00:51:57.708
Stay the fuck away from me!

831
00:51:57.791 --> 00:51:58.625
I facilitated--

832
00:51:58.708 --> 00:52:02.083
Heather, listen to me, deep breaths,
everything's gonna be fine, okay?

833
00:52:02.166 --> 00:52:03.166
Just relax.

834
00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:13.416
Heather!

835
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:24.625
Oh, shit.

836
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.750
Oh, shit.

837
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:33.958
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

838
00:52:35.375 --> 00:52:37.375
Oh, my God.

839
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:42.791
Oh, shit!

840
00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:45.583
Oh, my God.

841
00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:49.416
Oh, shit.

842
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:51.791
God damn it, Mark.

843
00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:56.708
I don't feel a pulse.

844
00:52:56.791 --> 00:52:59.291
What is wrong with you?
I told you to back it off.

845
00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:02.041
What? What?
What? I… I did back it off.

846
00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:04.500
-Forget your…
-I told you this would happen.

847
00:53:04.583 --> 00:53:06.791
She did not respond
to my direct order.

848
00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:08.083
You're talking shit.

849
00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:12.083
You are afraid to commit…
I told you every time, don't hesitate!

850
00:53:12.166 --> 00:53:14.208
{\an8}I give an instruction, do what I say!

851
00:53:15.958 --> 00:53:17.750
"Abnesti Pharmaceuticals"?

852
00:53:17.833 --> 00:53:19.500
Steve, I warned you.

853
00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:21.333
-You did not.
-This is his company.

854
00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:23.208
-I told you.
-Do not blame me!

855
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:25.791
You did not listen, I told you.
This is your fault.

856
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:27.333
I told you. I told you.

857
00:53:27.416 --> 00:53:30.750
-You remember that?

858
00:53:32.583 --> 00:53:33.583
"Bingo"?

859
00:53:34.583 --> 00:53:36.083
You think I have one job?

860
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.625
N-40.

861
00:53:40.708 --> 00:53:43.083
Can I have your permission
to administer N-40? Drip on?

862
00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:44.416
Acknowledge.

863
00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:51.500
You see this remote?

864
00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:55.416
{\an8}Let's say, you can slide this button
and Sarah gets some Darkenfloxx.

865
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:57.041
I-16.

866
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:00.541
What the hell?

867
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.416
-Where are you going?
-Shut up, Mark.

868
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.083
B-6.

869
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:17.041
I know it gets crazy in there,
but they're not made for jostling,

870
00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:18.250
they can flood.

871
00:55:13.125 --> 00:55:14.208
It's not your fault.

872
00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:17.583
Not your fault.

873
00:55:58.708 --> 00:56:01.333
This has gone too far.
We need to report this.

874
00:56:01.416 --> 00:56:04.458
Grow up. You shouldn't act like
we've crossed some sort of line here.

875
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:08.666
The time to worry about crossing lines
was a lot of lines ago.

876
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.875
If anyone finds out
what happened to Heather,

877
00:56:12.958 --> 00:56:14.625
they'll shut us down, Mark.

878
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.041
Everything I've accomplished will be lost,

879
00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:19.208
and don't think
they'll just come after me.

880
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:20.625
You'll go down too.

881
00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:23.375
Yeah.

882
00:56:27.833 --> 00:56:28.833
Hey.

883
00:56:31.291 --> 00:56:32.291
I'm sorry.

884
00:56:34.416 --> 00:56:35.833
Okay, this was awful.

885
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.791
But what do I always tell you? Hmm?

886
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.291
Pressure forms diamonds.

887
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:44.250
Yeah.

888
00:56:45.583 --> 00:56:47.833
This is fine, okay?

889
00:56:47.916 --> 00:56:50.166
You and I,
we're gonna redouble our efforts.

890
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:54.291
We're gonna gold star B-6,
and we'll change the world, Mark.

891
00:56:55.583 --> 00:57:00.291
And Heather?
Heather died for the best of causes, okay?

892
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:03.750
Okay.

893
00:57:04.666 --> 00:57:05.833
"Okay" okay?

894
00:57:07.166 --> 00:57:08.000
-Okay.
-Yeah?

895
00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.833
-Okay.
-Yeah? Sure? Huh?

896
00:57:09.916 --> 00:57:11.583
Come on, there you are.

897
00:57:12.125 --> 00:57:13.875
Hey, just go take some time, relax.

898
00:57:13.958 --> 00:57:17.125
Whatever helps you forget,
get out of here, go on.

899
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:30.958
Damn it.

900
00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:47.041
Is she dead?

901
00:57:52.375 --> 00:57:53.583
She's not the best.

902
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.750
That's not fair. Yeah. Yes, she's gone.

903
00:58:06.666 --> 00:58:09.125
This, uh… You know, this is science, Jeff.

904
00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:14.416
And in science,
we have to explore the unknown.

905
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.958
The unknown can lead to the unforeseen,

906
00:58:17.041 --> 00:58:19.375
-and we had no way of predicting that--
-I get it.

907
00:58:21.333 --> 00:58:24.125
Uh, your tone
of voice there, Jeff,

908
00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:27.083
which I perfectly understand.

909
00:58:27.166 --> 00:58:30.666
But be fair. You think
what happened today, you think I liked it?

910
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.291
I didn't. I'm a person too, you know, I…

911
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:40.041
I have feelings, and no one
is more broken up about this than me.

912
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:45.458
But in the long run,
our work will help ease suffering,

913
00:58:45.541 --> 00:58:48.375
it'll save lives,
not just one life, many lives.

914
00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:51.500
We're making the world a better place.

915
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:55.083
Are we?

916
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:56.416
Yes, Jeff, we are.

917
00:58:57.583 --> 00:58:58.583
You should be proud.

918
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.250
Personal sadness aside,
you did terrific in there.

919
00:59:02.333 --> 00:59:04.958
We all did terrific. Heather, especially.

920
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.041
Right up into the point where she…

921
00:59:09.291 --> 00:59:11.458
You know, it wasn't her finest moment,

922
00:59:11.541 --> 00:59:13.625
but everything prior to that,
she was doing great

923
00:59:13.708 --> 00:59:15.750
and she'll never be forgotten.

924
00:59:20.333 --> 00:59:21.333
What?

925
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:22.875
It's just tough.

926
00:59:27.166 --> 00:59:28.166
Yeah.

927
00:59:30.708 --> 00:59:33.041
Can I get you something
for how you're feeling?

928
00:59:44.583 --> 00:59:48.208
I swear,
G-46 is good shit, right?

929
00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:49.125
Yeah.

930
00:59:49.208 --> 00:59:52.458
Maybe not change-the-world shit,
but it's good shit.

931
00:59:52.541 --> 00:59:55.375
It's definitely good shit.

932
00:59:55.958 --> 00:59:58.916
It's hard to have
even one sad thought on this stuff.

933
01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:02.291
What's your worst memory?

934
01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:03.875
What?

935
01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:06.541
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question.

936
01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:14.250
Mine, uh… Mine was… I was…

937
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.541
I was eight years old

938
01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:20.791
and, uh, my dad told me
he was gonna take me to summer camp.

939
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.291
I was so excited.

940
01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:26.666
And he dropped me off,
and it turns out it wasn't summer camp,

941
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.208
it was foster care…

942
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.250
…and I never saw him again.

943
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.833
Oh, my God.

944
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:35.833
I'm laughing too.

945
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.416
That's just so terrible, man.

946
01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:42.333
It seems funny. Try it.

947
01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:43.708
He never came back.

948
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:47.625
He never came back.
Not even for a weekend.

949
01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:50.208
I'm actually sorry to hear that, man.

950
01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.291
Damn.

951
01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:53.791
Oh, the dose is too strong.

952
01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:58.500
God.

953
01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:00.833
Man, look at us, huh?

954
01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:03.375
Jeff and Steve.

955
01:01:03.916 --> 01:01:05.750
Steve and Jeff hanging out.

956
01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:07.500
Friends.

957
01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:08.750
Ehh…

958
01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.166
-What?

959
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.541
Come on, we're up here together.

960
01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:15.041
Enjoying the view.
That's a friendly thing to do.

961
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:16.875
You can… Well…

962
01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:22.958
You can walk out that door
anytime you want.

963
01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:24.916
I can't.

964
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:28.250
No, I can't. Not anymore.

965
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:34.166
What's stopping you?

966
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:41.500
The same thing that's stopping you
and every decision I've ever made.

967
01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:45.333
The ones that led me here to this place.

968
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.625
This is my one true love, Jeff.

969
01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:52.666
And once you fall in love,
it's hard to fall back out.

970
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.750
Okay.

971
01:02:00.666 --> 01:02:04.791
Jeff and Steve… stuck at summer camp.

972
01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.708
To Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

973
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.833
Get that fucking thing away from me!

974
01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:31.958
Lizzy, listen. Deep breaths.
Everything's gonna be fine.

975
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:32.916
Please!

976
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.041
For the record, can you tell us
what you're so afraid of?

977
01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:37.666
Get it the fuck away!

978
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.375
The Verbaluce isn't doing shit.

979
01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:41.666
Yeah.

980
01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:43.625
This one's a goodie.

981
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.166
Phobica.

982
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.708
Please stop it! Please stop!

983
01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:51.416
Make people afraid of things
that are bad for them.

984
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.500
What, like gluten?

985
01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:54.250
Yeah. Or thinking too much.

986
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:04.541
Please, get that fucking thing
away from me!

987
01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:07.708
I'm worried about
post-traumatic stress.

988
01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:09.083
From the stapler?

989
01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:12.500
Hey, Lizzy? Lizzy, it's just a stapler.

990
01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:13.750
Just get away now!

991
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.375
What, should we pack it in?

992
01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:19.375
Steve, should we pack it in?

993
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:22.500
-Yeah, okay.

994
01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:31.333
The worst one yet. By far.

995
01:03:33.708 --> 01:03:34.916
How do you feel now?

996
01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:40.458
Not afraid. Just, uh…

997
01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:41.583
Ashamed?

998
01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.791
Yeah, I hate that feeling.

999
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.375
I couldn't stand
feeling that way in front of you.

1000
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.250
That's why I asked to be off snack.

1001
01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:04.916
You know, all the years I spent at State.

1002
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:07.666
I come here, and I'm, like…

1003
01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:10.833
Is this place even really so much better?

1004
01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:11.916
Hmm.

1005
01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.500
I mean, I'd take some beatdowns.

1006
01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.833
Instead of having a fear
of a goddamn stapler.

1007
01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:22.541
Why do we keep saying yes?

1008
01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:26.416
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge.

1009
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.083
And for what? A private hall pass?

1010
01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:33.708
A bedroom to ourselves?
Copper freakin' pots? I mean…

1011
01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:43.791
All the times you've said yes,
why did you?

1012
01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.833
I guess I felt like I deserved it.

1013
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.416
That's what I've been
meaning to tell you, Lizzy.

1014
01:05:02.708 --> 01:05:05.083
Yeah. I think I might go with them.

1015
01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:08.416
Hey.

1016
01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.833
Hey. Wait up.

1017
01:05:13.916 --> 01:05:16.416
-She can't live without me.

1018
01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:26.291
You cool to drive?

1019
01:05:26.916 --> 01:05:27.958
Ice cold.

1020
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.500
Whoo!

1021
01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:56.416
Whoo!

1022
01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:12.666
Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

1023
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.625
-Jeff!

1024
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.500
Emma. Come on, baby. Come on.

1025
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.041
Emma! Come on, baby. Come on.

1026
01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.166
Hey, babe.

1027
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:03.500
I know you're probably getting sick of me
leaving these things for you,

1028
01:07:03.583 --> 01:07:08.000
but I just wanted to tell you
the usual that I miss you…

1029
01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:13.541
-and I'm sorry.

1030
01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:15.916
The mailbox
for this customer is full.

1031
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.666
It cannot receive
any more messages at this time.

1032
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.958
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.333
Two counts, voluntary manslaughter.

1034
01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.708
And that doesn't include Heather.

1035
01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:40.916
Don't do that to yourself.

1036
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.875
That's not on you.

1037
01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:46.125
You did everything you could.

1038
01:07:46.208 --> 01:07:47.208
No.

1039
01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:49.875
I said "acknowledge."

1040
01:07:51.916 --> 01:07:53.500
And I don't even know why.

1041
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.666
You're a good soul.

1042
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:43.750
-We're bad. We're very bad.

1043
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:52.332
For what it's worth, I think
we're the least of all evils in here.

1044
01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:55.125
Yeah? What makes you say that?

1045
01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.500
You hear things.

1046
01:08:57.582 --> 01:08:58.957
Oh, you hear things?

1047
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:00.750
Yeah. You know Ray?

1048
01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:01.832
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.125
So, after four times in jail for drugs,
Ray went to rehab

1050
01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:09.791
and then to what they call
a rehab refresh,

1051
01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:13.582
which is basically for people
who are so immune to rehab,

1052
01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:15.375
-it stops working.
-Hmm.

1053
01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:20.291
But he must have been immune to that too,
because then came his biggie.

1054
01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:22.457
Triple murder.

1055
01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:30.166
Yeah, his dealer, the dealer's sister,
and the dealer's sister's boyfriend.

1056
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.082
Shit, man.

1057
01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:37.416
You know Rogan?

1058
01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:40.041
-Big diesel Rogan. Hell, yeah.
-Yeah.

1059
01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:42.541
-Who doesn't know Rogan?
-He came home.

1060
01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:47.125
Found his girlfriend cheating on him
and threw her out an eight-story window.

1061
01:09:47.207 --> 01:09:48.416
Oh, shit.

1062
01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.041
She did not survive.

1063
01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:54.375
Crazy.

1064
01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:55.750
Yeah, I don't get it.

1065
01:09:55.833 --> 01:09:59.000
-Like, how's it possible, man?
-What?

1066
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:02.166
If we're all so bad, where's the bad?

1067
01:10:04.416 --> 01:10:05.875
You guys are up late.

1068
01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.333
Yeah.

1069
01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:10.666
Cheat day.

1070
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.125
Oh, Jeff, we may wanna reconsider
the community snack bowl, given, uh…

1071
01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.166
Shit-finger.

1072
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:19.916
Yeah. Have a wonderful evening.

1073
01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.166
-And you.

1074
01:11:02.916 --> 01:11:03.916
Bingo.

1075
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.166
Yes.

1076
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:39.541
Okay. I understand. Mm-hmm.

1077
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:40.625
Thank you.

1078
01:11:41.416 --> 01:11:44.000
Hey, Jeff, thanks for coming in.
How're you feeling?

1079
01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:45.541
Uh, I'm good.

1080
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:50.750
All right, good. Uh, listen,
this breaks my heart wide open.

1081
01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:55.625
But Protcom are insisting
on one last trial to establish a baseline.

1082
01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:56.541
Uh, we…

1083
01:11:56.625 --> 01:12:01.041
You have to administer Darkenfloxx
to someone you've never shared N-40 with.

1084
01:12:05.916 --> 01:12:06.916
Someone who?

1085
01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:11.166
That's what breaks my heart, Jeff.
It really does.

1086
01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:14.000
Eh, Mark, if you would.

1087
01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:31.375
No. Sorry, I can't do it.

1088
01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:32.750
Of course you can, Jeff.

1089
01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:35.875
This is the last time
anyone's gonna get Darkenfloxxed, okay?

1090
01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:37.625
Yeah, uh, Lizzy doesn't deserve this.

1091
01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.875
It won't go as far this time.
You have my word.

1092
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.208
You're not listening to me.

1093
01:12:41.291 --> 01:12:44.291
Jeff, come on. You sound nothing like
the guy that first arrived here.

1094
01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:47.458
That guy would've done anything
to make his crime right.

1095
01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:49.416
Would you just shut up, man?

1096
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:55.000
I'm not doing it.

1097
01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:58.916
Calm.

1098
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.333
Maybe we should take the night. Yeah?

1099
01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:12.541
Things always feel better in the morning.

1100
01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:16.333
Yeah, sure.

1101
01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:30.583
Just remember, Jeff, uh, what you did
won't have to happen to anyone again.

1102
01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:33.833
Drugs like this
will prevent places like this.

1103
01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:37.250
No more damage, no more damaged people.

1104
01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:41.583
Only you can prevent another you.

1105
01:13:48.916 --> 01:13:50.000
Double his dose.

1106
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:09.291
I know you're struggling,
but this will help.

1107
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.833
What's in the red one?

1108
01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:19.416
-Sorry.

1109
01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:25.500
It's just a toy.

1110
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:32.041
The red one's a placebo. We put it--

1111
01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:33.125
Stop.

1112
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:35.625
Just stop.

1113
01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:43.208
There is no Protocol Committee, is there?

1114
01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:47.000
This is his company.

1115
01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.875
I saw his letterhead.

1116
01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:55.250
Abnesti Pharmaceuticals.

1117
01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.875
He's the one in charge

1118
01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:04.083
and he's naming the drugs
using a goddamn Bingo card, Mark.

1119
01:15:05.208 --> 01:15:07.583
What are you doing
working at a place like this?

1120
01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:11.875
I mean, all this talk of N-40,
I call bullshit, man.

1121
01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.125
Abnesti doesn't care about love.

1122
01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:19.833
No, he cares about the red one.

1123
01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:23.958
B-6.

1124
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:29.875
How can you go along with this?

1125
01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:33.000
You could work anywhere.

1126
01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.250
Why here? Why him?

1127
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.500
There are so few geniuses.

1128
01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.750
He promised me we would change the world.

1129
01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.041
I just wanted to help people.

1130
01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.666
You still can.

1131
01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:28.833
Hey, Jeff, man of the hour.

1132
01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:34.458
Hope you got some sleep,
thought things over, yeah?

1133
01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:37.458
Why don't you, uh, take the driver's seat?

1134
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:38.708
Mark's out today.

1135
01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:41.375
He's got a stuffed up nose
or something.

1136
01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:44.500
Millennials, huh?

1137
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:49.875
Sorry, that's a… It's an unfair word.

1138
01:16:49.958 --> 01:16:52.833
You think about it,
someone arbitrarily decides

1139
01:16:52.916 --> 01:16:56.583
that everyone born between this date
and that date, they all act the same.

1140
01:16:56.666 --> 01:17:00.333
It's like a… A horoscope, but stupider.

1141
01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:05.791
You and Mark are nothing alike.

1142
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I don't know.

1143
01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.958
It was Mark who made me reconsider.

1144
01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.166
Ah.

1145
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.333
Well, I'll forgive his sniffles.

1146
01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:25.958
Anyway, so it's you and me
and Lizzy, makes three.

1147
01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:27.875
How're you doing, Lizzy?

1148
01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:30.833
Could use some Vitamin D.

1149
01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:33.000
We'll get you
some sunshine soon enough.

1150
01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.250
All right, Jeff.

1151
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:39.666
Uh, I filled Lizzy's vials with
the last of the Darkenfloxx this morning.

1152
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.708
Dumped the rest. Gone.

1153
01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:45.458
Shall we put this thing
behind us for good?

1154
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.291
Fine. Let's do this.

1155
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.416
Lizzy? Drip on?

1156
01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:54.541
Yeah, acknowledge.

1157
01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:59.166
And, Jeff,
give Lizzy the Darkenfloxx.

1158
01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:34.916
Sorry.

1159
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:38.041
Hmm?

1160
01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:42.000
The answer is still no.

1161
01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.166
J… Jeff.

1162
01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:49.375
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1163
01:18:53.833 --> 01:18:56.625
Okay. What are we
up against here, Jeff? Huh?

1164
01:18:57.291 --> 01:19:01.083
You think you love her?
You don't even know her.

1165
01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:04.458
I swear, the judgment on display
in this fucking building!

1166
01:19:05.625 --> 01:19:08.333
How about
a little share circle, huh? Yeah.

1167
01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:10.833
Why don't you
tell Jeff what you're in for?

1168
01:19:10.916 --> 01:19:13.125
-I don't care.
-That's what love is.

1169
01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:15.708
Getting to know each other.
Let's get to know each other.

1170
01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:17.458
Doesn't matter. She already told me.

1171
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:20.041
-Oh, did she?
-Robbery. Big deal.

1172
01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:22.750
Really? Is that what you told him, Lizzy?

1173
01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:24.666
Your future husband, father of your kids.

1174
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:27.416
He deserves to know the truth.
Tell him. Come on.

1175
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.833
Hmm?

1176
01:19:28.916 --> 01:19:29.833
You don't have to.

1177
01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:31.041
Come on. Tell him.

1178
01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:33.708
Come on, Lizzy, tell him. Tell him.

1179
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:38.291
No? All right, I'll do it. Okay?

1180
01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:41.583
It's cool. I got your files right here.
Let's, uh… Let's see.

1181
01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:44.500
Yeah? Let's find out about Lizzy.

1182
01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:46.500
-Get to know each other.
-I don't need you to.

1183
01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:49.416
-I know who I am and what I've done.
-Elizabeth Dianne Harris.

1184
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.458
Born in Prescott, Arizona.

1185
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:54.666
-Raised in a group home…
-I don't need you to. I know who I am.

1186
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.708
I know who I am!
I'm the mother who killed her baby.

1187
01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:11.875
That's who I am, Jeff.

1188
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:17.875
The mother
who forgot her little girl in her car

1189
01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:21.166
at a Walmart parking lot
in July for three hours…

1190
01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:25.375
while I went to work.

1191
01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:31.666
One count, reckless endangerment.
One count, manslaughter

1192
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:35.333
of my nine-month-old little girl.

1193
01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.333
My own…

1194
01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:44.291
My own flesh and blood.

1195
01:20:54.958 --> 01:20:59.708
Now, I don't know what kind of
sick-ass experiment this is,

1196
01:21:01.416 --> 01:21:05.708
but whatever he wants you to do to me,
come on, let's get on with it, okay?

1197
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:09.291
The quicker we get over with,
it'll be better for all of us.

1198
01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:13.958
Come on, man. You can't hurt me.

1199
01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:19.291
You can't hurt me.

1200
01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:22.125
There's no greater pain
than having to wake up

1201
01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:25.166
every fucking morning without her. Okay?

1202
01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:28.666
And I know you think you love me,

1203
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:32.375
but anything in me worth loving
died with her long ago.

1204
01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:36.041
So, come on. Let's do it.
Come on. Give it to me.

1205
01:21:36.666 --> 01:21:37.833
Fucking give it to me.

1206
01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:41.791
Give it to me! Fucking do your job, Jeff!

1207
01:21:41.875 --> 01:21:43.416
Give it to me!

1208
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:47.250
Give it to me.

1209
01:21:48.083 --> 01:21:49.083
Please.

1210
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:19.541
Sorry.

1211
01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:21.708
What's so funny?

1212
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:24.208
Uh, no…

1213
01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:26.083
Her sitting in there, this whole thing,

1214
01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:28.958
you with that phone,
everyone acting all serious.

1215
01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:32.333
{\an8}Is it just me who finds this amusing?

1216
01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:34.125
{\an8}

1217
01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:35.208
{\an8}Yeah.

1218
01:22:36.166 --> 01:22:37.666
{\an8}-Only you.

1219
01:22:50.291 --> 01:22:52.583
-Mark's not sick, is he?

1220
01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.250
-Give me that.
-No.

1221
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:02.750
Stop it. Stop it, you're scaring me, okay?

1222
01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:05.875
-Just stop. Stop. Please don't hurt me.

1223
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:07.458
Don't… Don't hurt me. Okay?

1224
01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:11.166
-Oh, fuck. Christ.

1225
01:23:13.708 --> 01:23:14.708
God…

1226
01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:17.833
Mark spiked my MobiPak.

1227
01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:22.750
That's right. He emptied my MobiPak
and gave you Darkenfloxx.

1228
01:23:23.583 --> 01:23:25.916
He's coming back here
right now with the police.

1229
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.666
How could he?

1230
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:29.875
He and I… You and I were…

1231
01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.458
Make it stop!

1232
01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:36.041
-Can I get you something…
-Make it stop!

1233
01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:37.458
…for how you're feeling?

1234
01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:40.791
That was the first thing you said to me…

1235
01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:46.416
…the acknowledgement that you needed
for the most important study of them all.

1236
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.291
-And what did we say?
-Yes!

1237
01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.166
What were we saying yes to, huh?

1238
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.708
What were we agreeing
to put in our bodies every single day?

1239
01:23:57.541 --> 01:23:59.375
-B-6.

1240
01:23:59.458 --> 01:24:01.833
It doesn't make you
happy or hungry or horny.

1241
01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:03.666
It makes you do as you're told.

1242
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:08.000
"Laugh, stop laughing.
Eat, stop eating. Fuck, stop fucking!"

1243
01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:12.458
You weren't testing those other drugs.
You were testing B-6.

1244
01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:14.083
Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1245
01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:16.208
-I'm sorry.

1246
01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:21.583
What were you gonna call it?

1247
01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:25.958
Fine then.

1248
01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:27.166
{\an8}

1249
01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:28.916
{\an8}

1250
01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.458
What were you going to call it?

1251
01:24:33.541 --> 01:24:35.583
O-B-D-X.

1252
01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:37.833
Obediex.

1253
01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:40.875
And it did work.

1254
01:24:40.958 --> 01:24:44.916
Enough for you to live amongst killers.
But not enough for a gold star. Why?

1255
01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:48.250
B-6 had to be perfect.

1256
01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.125
The goal wasn't obedience.

1257
01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:53.291
It was absolute obedience
without exceptions.

1258
01:24:54.166 --> 01:24:57.166
We had to know,
could we get you to follow an order

1259
01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:01.583
antithetical to
your deepest values and emotions.

1260
01:25:01.666 --> 01:25:04.541
Do the very thing
you'd least want to do in the world.

1261
01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:06.958
Hurt someone you love.

1262
01:25:07.041 --> 01:25:10.791
B-6 could force you to repeat
the precise act you most regretted,

1263
01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:13.375
to harm another,
someone you held dear.

1264
01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:15.666
It could force anyone to do anything.

1265
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.125
I trusted you.

1266
01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:21.833
We trusted you with our lives!

1267
01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:26.083
You made us do
all this shit to each other,

1268
01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:28.458
thinking it was our choice,
but it was yours.

1269
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.083
You took away our--

1270
01:25:31.166 --> 01:25:33.000
Your what? Your free will, Jeff?

1271
01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:35.875
Oh, God. Where did that get you, huh?

1272
01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.750
Can't you picture it?

1273
01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:43.041
A world filled with people
who do as they're told.

1274
01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:50.083
We'd be selling peace and harmony itself.

1275
01:25:50.166 --> 01:25:53.916
The ability to compel people to act
on behalf of the greater good.

1276
01:25:55.791 --> 01:25:58.500
Behave, not as they want,
but as they damn well should.

1277
01:26:00.333 --> 01:26:05.125
No more drunks crashing cars.
Husbands killing wives.

1278
01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:06.625
Kids left at summer camp.

1279
01:26:09.541 --> 01:26:11.375
What does it matter? B-6 failed.

1280
01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:15.375
I want you to tell the world
what you did to Heather.

1281
01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.541
Man, I could go to…
I could go to prison, it would ruin me.

1282
01:26:20.625 --> 01:26:23.416
Everything I built.
I could go to prison, Jeff.

1283
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.125
Jeff and Steve. Not that different.

1284
01:26:29.208 --> 01:26:30.041
Yeah.

1285
01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:32.583
What's so funny?

1286
01:26:35.833 --> 01:26:38.333
You were free to go seven months ago.

1287
01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:42.750
And Lizzy, her appeal
just fell on very sympathetic ears.

1288
01:26:43.208 --> 01:26:44.625
She's been free for a week.

1289
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:56.583
She's walking out of here. Today.

1290
01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:59.458
Open the front door.

1291
01:27:06.958 --> 01:27:10.291
{\an8}I'm gonna make sure
you never do this to anyone ever again.

1292
01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:23.541
Give me the knife.

1293
01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:29.916
I said… give it to me.

1294
01:27:30.958 --> 01:27:31.958
Why?

1295
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:35.875
Because I told you to, Steve,

1296
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.750
and because I put enough B-6
in your veins to tame a goddamn lion.

1297
01:27:45.791 --> 01:27:46.916
Really works, huh?

1298
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:51.750
Not when someone has been told
to kill the only thing he's ever loved.

1299
01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:55.833
I learned that from you.

1300
01:28:12.833 --> 01:28:15.500
I just Darkenfloxxed Lizzy.
All four vials.

1301
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:33.000
Hey.

1302
01:29:45.666 --> 01:29:47.833
-It's okay. You're okay.

1303
01:29:50.875 --> 01:29:52.666
It's okay.

1304
01:29:54.708 --> 01:29:56.791
I'm so… I'm so sorry.

1305
01:29:57.333 --> 01:29:58.333
For what?

1306
01:29:59.375 --> 01:30:01.416
I'm sorry I lied.

1307
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.083
Lizzy, I love you.

1308
01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:06.791
Nothing you said or did
is gonna change that.

1309
01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:26.958
Friends and neighbors,

1310
01:30:27.041 --> 01:30:30.333
I'm sorry to interrupt,
particularly with news like this.

1311
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:33.833
We have an attempted escape.

1312
01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:36.750
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy.

1313
01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.208
Most of you know Jeff and Lizzy,

1314
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:47.500
and it saddens me to my core
that they have misled the authorities

1315
01:30:47.583 --> 01:30:49.000
who are on the way here now.

1316
01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:51.375
I explained that that would mean
the end of the program

1317
01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:55.125
and the comfortable life that it affords
us all, but they wouldn't listen.

1318
01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:58.708
Oh, no.

1319
01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:06.291
Do any of you relish
the thought of returning to State?

1320
01:31:06.375 --> 01:31:08.708
What would you
be willing to do to prevent that

1321
01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:11.375
to preserve the noble mission…

1322
01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:12.291
Fuck!

1323
01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:14.083
…to which we've devoted our lives?

1324
01:31:15.708 --> 01:31:17.375
Fucking piece of shit!

1325
01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:27.416
{\an8}Stop Jeff and Lizzy, not for me, for you.

1326
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.500
{\an8}

1327
01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:33.958
Fuck!

1328
01:31:50.125 --> 01:31:50.958
Shit-finger?

1329
01:32:11.166 --> 01:32:12.625
I knew it was you, snack man.

1330
01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.500
{\an8}

1331
01:32:55.208 --> 01:32:56.083
There they are!

1332
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.125
-Come on, get 'em. Get up! Come on!

1333
01:33:28.583 --> 01:33:30.000
-Hold on, Dave.

1334
01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:33.458
I have a key to the pantry.

1335
01:33:35.541 --> 01:33:37.333
It has food in it for, like, six months.

1336
01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:43.625
Awesome. Thanks.

1337
01:34:19.541 --> 01:34:21.541
{\an8}

1338
01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:25.041
{\an8}Alpha Whiskey Delta,
departing to the north.

1339
01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.333

1342
01:34:45.083 --> 01:34:46.083
Sorry.

1343
01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:50.041
Zero-nine-zero…

1344
01:34:50.541 --> 01:34:52.291
Heading zero…

1345
01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:56.291
Alpha Whiskey
Delta, that transmission was gargled.

1346
01:34:56.375 --> 01:34:58.000
Do you require any assistance?

1347
01:34:59.291 --> 01:35:00.875

01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:03.291

I wish there was

You take it and everything starts over.

1376
01:37:31.833 --> 01:37:34.875
Everyone you ever loved,
you did right by them.

1377
01:37:34.958 --> 01:37:39.500
Treated them like gold
and you feel like it's all ahead of me.

1378
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:43.166
This beautiful life,
all the pleasures of it.

1379

The love I could give,

But there's no drug like that.

So, we're gonna
have to do it for ourselves.
