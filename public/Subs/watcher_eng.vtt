00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.626
I uh...

2
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.556
Uh, he was asking if we have
any family left in Romania.

3
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.135
You don't speak Romanian?

4
00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:37.204
Um, no, I don't. Sorry.

5
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.600
Hey, easy.

6
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.246
What did he say?

7
00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:52.447
-He said he hates you.

8
00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.722
No, no, no,
I say you are beautiful.

9
00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:57.224
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>

10
00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:00.986
<i>Foarte frumoasa.</i>

11
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.993
-Thank you.

12
00:02:11.837 --> 00:02:13.207
Oh...

13
00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:26.410
Is this it?

14
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.651
Uh... I think so.

15
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:47.571
Julia.

16
00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:12.123
Hey, not bad.

17
00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:21.638
Hm, it's from work.

18
00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.072
You don't like?

19
00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.778
No. No, it's lovely.

20
00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:33.084
Um...<i> frumoas--</i>

21
00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.218
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>

22
00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.918
I smell like plane.

23
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.954
Oh, well, that's my favorite.

24
00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.289
Stale peanuts and
sweaty strangers.

25
00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:12.524
Why did she think
I didn't like the place?

26
00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:15.194
Because you smile too much.

27
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.027
Are you telling me that
I walk around grinning
like an idiot?

28
00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:19.190
Only around me.

29
00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.669
Mm... you're insufferable.

30
00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:45.479
Can't sleep?

31
00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:50.011
No.

32
00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:53.081
Sorry if I woke you.

33
00:06:53.217 --> 00:06:54.279
Come here.

34
00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:05.158
When do you have to wake up
tomorrow?

35
00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:07.424
Early.

36
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.504
Wake me up before you leave,
okay?

37
00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:12.099
Okay.

38
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.509
I will.

39
00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:23.517
Oh...

40
00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:51.007
<i>I'm learning Romanian.</i>

41
00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.375
<i>She is a beautiful woman.</i>

42
00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:03.986
<i>She is a beautiful woman.</i>

43
00:08:14.365 --> 00:08:16.735
<i>I eat carrots.</i>

44
00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:31.079
<i>I eat carrots.</i>

45
00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.264
<i>I would like to see a movie.</i>

46
00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:59.373
<i>Maria drinks coffee</i>
<i>with her father.</i>

47
00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:09.920
Uh...<i> un cafea va rog.</i>

48
00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:12.157
<i>O cafea.</i>

49
00:09:12.192 --> 00:09:13.750
<i>O cafea.</i> Sorry.

50
00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.556
No, your accent is great.

51
00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:16.887
Thank you.

52
00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.032
<i>O cafea cu lapte?</i>

53
00:09:19.067 --> 00:09:20.595
<i>Da, cu lapte.</i>

54
00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:31.168
Hey, hey!

55
00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:32.871
I'm sorry.

56
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.367
Sorry.

57
00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.522
Um, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

58
00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:33.231
-Oh, the light.
-The light. Yes.

59
00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:35.296
Okay. Thank you.

60
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.477
-Hello, darling.

61
00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:02.152
Any reason in particular
you're standing in the dark?

62
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.991
Just people watching.

63
00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:10.496
How was work?

64
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:12.063
Exhausting.

65
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.659
But good.

66
00:13:20.869 --> 00:13:21.974
Is this for me?

67
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:23.701
It's for you.

68
00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:26.704
It's kind of silly.

69
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:29.212
Yes.

70
00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:32.677
It is. Very silly.

71
00:13:33.882 --> 00:13:35.053
And I love it.

72
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.362
For you.

73
00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:48.935
What is it?

74
00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:53.062
It's a...
It's a symbol.

75
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:54.941
A symbol of what?

76
00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:57.507
That spring has arrived.

77
00:13:57.843 --> 00:14:00.045
-Isn't it obvious?

78
00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:24.905
What's happening?

79
00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:31.769
They're not sure.

80
00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:07.904
-Hey.
-Hey, come look at this.

81
00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:14.317
I think this is what we
passed by the other night.

82
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.423
What are they saying?

83
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:23.793
They're talking about
the last time she was seen.

84
00:15:24.062 --> 00:15:26.494
-She was murdered?
-So it seems.

85
00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:32.038
That guy was there.
What is he saying?

86
00:15:33.969 --> 00:15:35.371
He found the body.

87
00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:37.071
How did she, uh--

88
00:15:40.415 --> 00:15:41.542
They didn't say.

89
00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:46.283
They're gonna be here at- 00.

90
00:15:49.356 --> 00:15:50.514
Okay.

91
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:53.219
I can't figure out if
Simion likes me

92
00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:56.121
or if he thinks I'm an idiot.

93
00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:58.656
I swear, every time I think
I'm getting in with him,

94
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.759
he shuts the door in my face
like I'm...

95
00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:03.894
fuckin' Diane Keaton
at the end of<i> The Godfather.</i>

96
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:11.737
Hey.

97
00:16:13.677 --> 00:16:14.839
What?

98
00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.347
What's up?

99
00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:19.580
Nothing.

100
00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:29.359
There's this guy that lives
across the street,

101
00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:31.823
and he's always
looking over here.

102
00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:35.431
Looking in over here how?

103
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.198
Every time I look over there,
he's just...

104
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:40.433
standing in his window

105
00:16:40.469 --> 00:16:42.207
and it's like he's
staring right at me.

106
00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:45.408
Which window is it?

107
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.010
Right there.

108
00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.921
-I can't see anything.
-Because it's day.

109
00:17:01.357 --> 00:17:03.553
He only looks in at night?

110
00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:05.396
I can only see him at night.

111
00:17:05.865 --> 00:17:08.068
Doesn't mean that he's not...

112
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.303
You know what?
Forget it.

113
00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:13.133
No. Come on.

114
00:17:13.602 --> 00:17:15.464
If you're feeling uncomfortable
about something,

115
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.674
we should talk about it.

116
00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:18.309
Really. I'm fine.

117
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:21.906
So you're Diane Keaton now?

118
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.909
Mm-hm. That's exactly
what I said.

119
00:17:38.926 --> 00:17:41.360
I'm-- I'm sorry, I was just
telling your husband that

120
00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:42.898
he needs some new accounts.

121
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:44.603
What else do they have you on?

122
00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:46.434
Uh... Frosty Cakes,

123
00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:48.434
and some company
that sells office supplies

124
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.836
-marketed towards women.

125
00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:53.274
You just need to make
a better impression on Simion.

126
00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:54.838
Oh, that's a really good idea.
Thank you.

127
00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.147
-I hadn't thought of that.

128
00:17:56.183 --> 00:17:59.178
And don't confuse
<i>chinui</i> with<i> se chinui.</i>

129
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:01.945
-What happened?

130
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.690
Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier

131
00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:05.958
during a presentation

132
00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:08.059
and I'm never gonna hear
the end of it.

133
00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:09.794
He was
trying to say to a client

134
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.029
that he'd fight for them,

135
00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:12.860
but instead he said
he'd torture them.

136
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.371
Oh, uh, is it okay if
I smoke in here?

137
00:18:21.407 --> 00:18:24.600
Uh, well, Julia gave up smoking
a few months ago.

138
00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:26.712
Really? I don't see you
as a smoker.

139
00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:28.272
I'm trying not to be.

140
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:30.646
-I-- I don't have to.
-No. No, really.

141
00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:32.083
It's totally fine.

142
00:18:32.118 --> 00:18:33.449
I don't want to be
a bad influence.

143
00:18:33.484 --> 00:18:35.417
-No, it-- it's fine.
-All right. Thanks.

144
00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:37.182
Francis told us
you're an actress.

145
00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:40.021
Oh, um, yeah.
I-- I was.

146
00:18:40.256 --> 00:18:42.022
-Um...

147
00:18:42.191 --> 00:18:43.795
Wasn't really for me,

148
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:46.663
so I'm, um, reevaluating.

149
00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:50.893
Uh, Jules and I had
an interesting experience
the other night, didn't we?

150
00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:52.170
We were walking
just a few blocks away,

151
00:18:52.205 --> 00:18:54.163
we go past this crime scene,
a bunch of cops.

152
00:18:54.198 --> 00:18:56.236
This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.

153
00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:59.102
-What happened?
-They found a woman
murdered in her apartment.

154
00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:01.841
-Yeah, you heard about it too?

155
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:09.222
Bullshit.

156
00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:13.655
What?

157
00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:19.932
Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?

158
00:19:20.168 --> 00:19:22.763
They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.

159
00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.736
-You didn't tell me that.
-They didn't say anything
about that.

160
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:29.438
It must be related to
the other attacks.

161
00:19:29.474 --> 00:19:32.440
So, uh, they found a woman
about a month ago

162
00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:34.207
with her throat slit
in her apartment

163
00:19:34.243 --> 00:19:35.541
around the same age.

164
00:19:35.577 --> 00:19:38.148
So, but this one,
he cut so deep,

165
00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:40.150
it was essentially
a decapitation.

166
00:19:40.186 --> 00:19:41.851
They're calling him
The Spider.

167
00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:56.302
-Do you need help?
-No, no, no, I'm fine.

168
00:20:50.954 --> 00:20:52.116
<i>Scuzi.</i>

169
00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.086
You must be the new neighbor.

170
00:20:55.828 --> 00:20:57.360
Oh, yeah.

171
00:20:57.395 --> 00:20:59.123
-You two just moved in, right?
-Yeah.

172
00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:00.927
Can you hear me?

173
00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.803
Um, yes,
your English is perfect.

174
00:21:03.838 --> 00:21:05.467
Thank you, but I meant

175
00:21:05.502 --> 00:21:06.838
can you hear me
inside my apartment?

176
00:21:07.106 --> 00:21:09.939
Oh, um... no.
Not really.

177
00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:11.036
Hm.

178
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.935
Can you hear us?

179
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.608
No. You are
suspiciously quiet.

180
00:21:15.644 --> 00:21:17.517
And I love you for this.

181
00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.509
-I'm Irina.
-Julia.

182
00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:23.117
Just bang on my wall if
I'm ever making too much noise.

183
00:21:23.153 --> 00:21:24.456
Okay.

184
00:22:13.137 --> 00:22:17.033
<i>I woke up and saw a man</i>
<i>standing over me in the dark.</i>

185
00:22:17.068 --> 00:22:18.769
<i>He put a pillow case</i>
<i>over my head</i>

186
00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:20.204
<i>so I couldn't see his face.</i>

187
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.714
<i>He held a knife to my throat</i>
<i>and pressed down.</i>

188
00:22:25.976 --> 00:22:27.385
<i>I thought I was going to die</i>

189
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.713
<i>because I felt it</i>
<i>going into my skin.</i>

190
00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:31.223
<i>But then he stopped</i>

191
00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:33.283
<i>and just sat next to me,</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

192
00:22:34.724 --> 00:22:36.759
<i>It felt like he was there</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

193
00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:44.399
<i>I think he was</i>
<i>watching me before.</i>

194
00:22:44.434 --> 00:22:46.230
<i>I just had a sense that...</i>

195
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.805
<i>someone was always behind me,</i>

196
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:52.445
<i>even when I was alone.</i>

197
00:24:14.754 --> 00:24:16.820
<i>Where is it, lady?</i>

198
00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:17.992
<i>I don't know.</i>

199
00:24:22.103 --> 00:24:23.268
<i>Give it to me.</i>

200
00:24:23.304 --> 00:24:26.363
-<i> It's mine!</i>
-<i> No!</i>

201
00:24:27.636 --> 00:24:30.339
<i>Peter! Peter!</i>

202
00:24:30.374 --> 00:24:32.237
<i>A man tried to kill me!</i>

203
00:24:56.971 --> 00:24:58.230
<i>Peter?</i>

204
00:25:00.137 --> 00:25:01.431
<i>Peter?</i>

205
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.676
<i>Peter, are you all right?</i>

206
00:25:06.912 --> 00:25:09.942
<i> Lock the door.</i>
<i>Don't let anyone in except me.</i>

207
00:25:09.977 --> 00:25:11.710
<i>And close these windows</i>
<i>after me.</i>

208
00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:13.543
<i>Be careful.</i>

209
00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.811
<i>You just took the words</i>
<i>right out of my mouth.</i>

210
00:25:40.575 --> 00:25:42.615
Uh... Marlboro.

211
00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:56.662
Uh, no, I'm-- I'm good.
Thank you.

212
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:23.799
-Hey!

213
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:27.311
-Is-- Is there a back door?

214
00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:36.819
Simion says
they like to be wooed,

215
00:28:36.854 --> 00:28:38.555
so we're going to headquarters
in Sofia

216
00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:40.058
to do the whole
song and dance.

217
00:28:40.728 --> 00:28:42.454
I don't know yet if it's
gonna be Nicolae or me.

218
00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:45.556
That's great.

219
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:50.330
You're not hungry?

220
00:28:52.206 --> 00:28:54.301
Uh... not really.

221
00:28:57.741 --> 00:29:00.371
This, uh, weird thing happened.

222
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:03.544
Um... there was this guy
at the movie theater,

223
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.451
and then he...

224
00:29:06.487 --> 00:29:08.315
followed me into
the supermarket.

225
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.451
Followed you?

226
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.453
Yeah.

227
00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:18.028
Did he say something to you?

228
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.866
Uh, no.

229
00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:22.362
No.

230
00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:27.873
Did he follow you here?

231
00:29:28.474 --> 00:29:29.974
No, I don't think so.

232
00:29:41.287 --> 00:29:42.382
You okay?

233
00:29:44.091 --> 00:29:45.121
Yeah.

234
00:29:46.154 --> 00:29:47.992
I think I just need to
sleep it off.

235
00:29:50.428 --> 00:29:51.556
Come here.

236
00:29:53.624 --> 00:29:56.192
the good news is,
if he ever comes here,

237
00:29:56.627 --> 00:29:58.871
you have your big strong man
to protect you.

238
00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:02.230
Okay.

239
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.702
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
just laugh at that.

240
00:30:14.617 --> 00:30:15.712
I'm sorry.

241
00:30:18.786 --> 00:30:20.090
No, um...

242
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.156
No, you--
you don't have to apologize.

243
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:24.628
I don't know why
I reacted like that.

244
00:30:24.663 --> 00:30:27.196
No, no, I-- I totally get it.

245
00:30:31.233 --> 00:30:33.568
Do you want to go back to
the supermarket?

246
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:36.040
I mean, they gotta have
security tapes, right?

247
00:30:57.357 --> 00:30:58.730
He thought you were
trying to steal.

248
00:30:58.765 --> 00:31:00.193
Oh, I wasn't trying to
steal something.

249
00:31:00.228 --> 00:31:01.962
There was a man
that was following me,

250
00:31:01.997 --> 00:31:03.232
I was just trying
to hide.

251
00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:13.709
Uh, what time were you in?

252
00:31:13.745 --> 00:31:15.706
Uh, around four, I think.

253
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.083
What'd he look like?

254
00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:28.259
Uh, he was white,

255
00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:30.419
mm, older.

256
00:31:30.454 --> 00:31:32.322
He was wearing a brown jacket.

257
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.465
No.

258
00:31:56.983 --> 00:31:58.023
That's him.

259
00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:08.429
Oh, okay, watch.

260
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:18.208
Wait for it.

261
00:32:24.241 --> 00:32:25.314
Just wait.

262
00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:30.286
There. See?

263
00:32:36.795 --> 00:32:38.459
He's staring right at me.

264
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.034
Maybe, or...

265
00:32:43.534 --> 00:32:44.663
Or what?

266
00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:48.502
Or he's staring at the woman
who's staring at him.

267
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.852
You gonna be okay?

268
00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:44.558
Of course. I'll be fine.

269
00:33:46.156 --> 00:33:47.723
I have to go to dinner
with some clients tonight,

270
00:33:47.758 --> 00:33:49.134
so I'm gonna be out
kind of late.

271
00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:51.730
Okay.

272
00:33:58.545 --> 00:33:59.771
Bye.

273
00:34:51.056 --> 00:34:52.130
Hey.

274
00:34:54.234 --> 00:34:56.300
I was just wondering when
you're gonna be back home.

275
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:00.304
Yeah, I figured.

276
00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:03.439
Do you know when you'll be back?

277
00:35:05.074 --> 00:35:06.970
No, it's just, um...

278
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.481
No, it's fine.
Um, it's fine.

279
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:16.782
Yeah, I'll see you
when you're back.

280
00:35:21.021 --> 00:35:22.117
You too.

281
00:36:56.615 --> 00:36:58.218
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

282
00:37:10.867 --> 00:37:11.901
I--

283
00:37:13.939 --> 00:37:15.536
-Elvis?
-Elvis.

284
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:18.574
-It's her cat.

285
00:37:19.473 --> 00:37:22.145
-What?
-Elvis is her cat.

286
00:37:22.448 --> 00:37:24.281
He's gone missing and
she's trying to find him,

287
00:37:24.316 --> 00:37:25.944
and she wants to know
if you've seen him.

288
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:29.519
Uh, I'm sorry,
I-- I haven't seen him.

289
00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.653
Oh...

290
00:37:44.801 --> 00:37:47.731
Poor Eleonora. That cat is
always trying to escape her.

291
00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:49.840
Thanks, by the way.

292
00:37:50.275 --> 00:37:52.402
My husband usually translates,
but...

293
00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:53.477
still at work.

294
00:37:53.913 --> 00:37:55.272
Working at 10 p.m.?

295
00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:56.640
Is he a stripper?

296
00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:58.916
No, no, works in marketing.

297
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.451
-With a client.
-Mm.

298
00:38:03.013 --> 00:38:04.785
Do you feel like
coming in for a drink?

299
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:07.784
I feel like another one,
and it's less sad

300
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.452
if there's another person
with me.

301
00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.052
-Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah?

302
00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.454
Sure. Yeah.
That sounds nice.

303
00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:13.530
Okay.

304
00:38:22.536 --> 00:38:24.640
-Come in.

305
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.751
I should have
stayed out longer.

306
00:38:33.987 --> 00:38:35.915
I look radiant with vodka.

307
00:38:42.026 --> 00:38:43.362
Do you like port?

308
00:38:43.862 --> 00:38:45.056
Yeah. Sure.

309
00:38:49.529 --> 00:38:50.658
<i>-Noroc.</i>
<i>-Noroc.</i>

310
00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:55.539
See? You do.

311
00:38:56.174 --> 00:38:57.739
I'm trying to learn.

312
00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:00.541
I wanted to surprise Francis.

313
00:39:00.676 --> 00:39:03.442
One day, just say something
very casually.

314
00:39:04.012 --> 00:39:06.041
-So your husband's Romanian?

315
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.915
Uh, his mother is but
he grew up in the US.

316
00:39:10.687 --> 00:39:13.450
And he brought you back to
the home country.

317
00:39:13.652 --> 00:39:15.459
Yeah. Got a promotion,

318
00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:18.188
and they needed someone in
the Bucharest office.

319
00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.257
It must be hard for you, though.

320
00:39:22.929 --> 00:39:24.903
It was hard for me
when I first moved away.

321
00:39:25.505 --> 00:39:28.564
I studied ballet in London
before I injured my knee.

322
00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.601
My English was terrible.

323
00:39:30.937 --> 00:39:32.806
I fell madly in love with it
eventually,

324
00:39:32.842 --> 00:39:35.744
but the first few months,
I was terribly lonely.

325
00:39:36.278 --> 00:39:37.581
Yeah, me too.

326
00:39:38.116 --> 00:39:39.407
Definitely be lonely.

327
00:39:40.243 --> 00:39:41.915
At least you have
your husband with you.

328
00:39:45.392 --> 00:39:47.156
I'm sorry, did I say something
to upset you?

329
00:39:47.191 --> 00:39:49.058
-No.
-Are you sure?

330
00:39:51.798 --> 00:39:53.223
Irina.

331
00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.242
Is everything okay?

332
00:40:09.411 --> 00:40:11.406
Yeah. It's just my ex.

333
00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:14.747
He sounds kind of scary.

334
00:40:14.782 --> 00:40:17.052
Yeah, he just sounds like that.

335
00:40:17.088 --> 00:40:18.149
It's all a show.

336
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.317
He's actually very sweet.

337
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:24.687
Anyway, he knows not to
cross the line.

338
00:40:24.723 --> 00:40:25.992
And what if he does?

339
00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:31.668
I'm serious.

340
00:40:34.334 --> 00:40:35.507
Open it.

341
00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:43.042
Whoa.

342
00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:45.246
He gave it to me as a present
when we were together

343
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:46.817
to defend myself.

344
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.977
I think he regrets it now
but, uh,

345
00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.451
it just makes it
easier for me

346
00:40:50.487 --> 00:40:51.984
to tell him to
go fuck himself.

347
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.320
I should tell more people
to go fuck themselves.

348
00:40:54.522 --> 00:40:55.783
-You should.
-Mm-hm.

349
00:40:56.286 --> 00:40:58.391
You should say...

350
00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:04.265
-Perfect!

351
00:42:17.207 --> 00:42:18.577
Fuck this.

352
00:42:30.623 --> 00:42:33.251
You're not really
looking in here, are you?

353
00:43:31.412 --> 00:43:32.508
Jules?

354
00:44:06.517 --> 00:44:08.049
What's goin' on?

355
00:44:12.954 --> 00:44:14.924
I saw the man
in the window again.

356
00:44:20.023 --> 00:44:21.700
I waved at him.

357
00:44:25.864 --> 00:44:27.266
And he waved back.

358
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.081
Which one is it?

359
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.380
One floor up to the left.

360
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.651
His light's off.

361
00:44:46.687 --> 00:44:48.089
He's in there.

362
00:44:50.095 --> 00:44:51.587
Don't--

363
00:44:59.172 --> 00:45:00.530
Do you see him?

364
00:45:05.268 --> 00:45:06.801
No, I can't see anything.

365
00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.439
It's too dark.

366
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.371
I want to call the cops.

367
00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:12.751
-Is that really necessary?
-Yes.

368
00:45:13.883 --> 00:45:15.881
So he followed you
from the theater

369
00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:17.547
across the street to the market?

370
00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:19.989
I think so.

371
00:45:21.084 --> 00:45:22.255
You think so?

372
00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:33.904
Mm-hm.
Can you describe him please?

373
00:45:34.438 --> 00:45:35.631
I have a photo.

374
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.444
So you think this is
the same man you saw
in the window?

375
00:45:43.613 --> 00:45:44.948
I think it could be.

376
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:48.178
You could identify his face
in a window

377
00:45:48.214 --> 00:45:49.821
in the building
across the street?

378
00:45:51.124 --> 00:45:52.280
Not exactly.

379
00:45:52.582 --> 00:45:55.123
It was dark.
It was his silhouette mostly.

380
00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:58.423
-Mostly?
-Look, this isn't normal.

381
00:45:59.566 --> 00:46:01.690
He's always there
looking in here.

382
00:46:02.797 --> 00:46:05.931
I-- I can feel him.

383
00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:07.795
Okay. Okay, okay.

384
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.136
I'll go over there, see if
he's looking in the window.

385
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:12.610
That's not polite, so...
I'll talk with him.

386
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:14.569
If you want,
you can come with me,

387
00:46:14.604 --> 00:46:16.910
see if it's the same man
as in the picture,

388
00:46:16.946 --> 00:46:19.609
so I think so can become
yes or no.

389
00:46:21.082 --> 00:46:22.447
I don't think that's
a good idea.

390
00:46:23.355 --> 00:46:24.889
I'll go.

391
00:46:25.986 --> 00:46:27.320
I'd like to get a look at him.

392
00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:29.924
Maybe I could just hang back,

393
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.357
get a glance of him
around the corner.

394
00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:33.161
Right?

395
00:46:34.299 --> 00:46:35.328
Yeah, sure.

396
00:47:37.824 --> 00:47:39.062
Was it him?

397
00:47:46.769 --> 00:47:48.236
Francis, was it him?

398
00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:55.045
Listen to me for a second.
Even if it was him,

399
00:47:55.847 --> 00:47:57.409
the guy lives in
our neighborhood.

400
00:47:57.678 --> 00:48:00.978
It's not crazy to think
that he'd be shopping at
the same store.

401
00:48:01.547 --> 00:48:04.648
I need you to stop
rationalizing this all away.

402
00:48:07.452 --> 00:48:09.059
You want me to
stop being rational?

403
00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:12.459
To just jump to
the craziest conclusion
like you?

404
00:48:12.762 --> 00:48:14.297
You think I'm crazy?

405
00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:16.995
No, I think--

406
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.494
I think you're stressed,

407
00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:20.397
and you're alone here
all day long--

408
00:48:20.432 --> 00:48:21.766
-Stop.
-You're in this new country--

409
00:48:21.801 --> 00:48:22.999
Stop!

410
00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:26.307
Stop talking to me like
I'm a fucking child.

411
00:48:36.215 --> 00:48:38.720
I can't-- I can't stay here.

412
00:48:38.755 --> 00:48:40.684
-Julia.

413
00:48:40.987 --> 00:48:42.518
I want to leave.

414
00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.894
Leave, like pack our bags
right now?

415
00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:47.063
You want to head to a hotel
or-- or,

416
00:48:47.099 --> 00:48:49.264
what, you want to get on a plane
back to New York?

417
00:48:50.562 --> 00:48:52.627
Please, just tell me
what you want me to do?

418
00:48:52.662 --> 00:48:54.536
I want you to
fucking believe me!

419
00:48:54.572 --> 00:48:55.930
God.

420
00:48:58.008 --> 00:48:59.805
This is just
a bad night, Jules.

421
00:49:00.007 --> 00:49:01.870
It's not a bad night.

422
00:49:04.311 --> 00:49:07.313
I can't think here,
I can't breathe,

423
00:49:07.348 --> 00:49:10.516
I mean, I-- I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

424
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.554
What-- What can I do?

425
00:49:16.529 --> 00:49:18.029
What can I do to help?

426
00:49:25.964 --> 00:49:27.203
Nothing.

427
00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.166
Hey, Jules, I'm headin' out.

428
00:53:36.283 --> 00:53:37.750
Do you speak English?

429
00:53:38.723 --> 00:53:39.917
Yes.

430
00:53:41.255 --> 00:53:42.491
What is this place?

431
00:53:43.925 --> 00:53:45.296
Museum.

432
00:53:46.963 --> 00:53:48.263
It's a museum?

433
00:53:48.298 --> 00:53:50.994
No.
Museum, it's a club.

434
00:53:53.972 --> 00:53:55.900
-Can I go in?
-Yeah, sure.

435
00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:21.920
Julia?

436
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:28.322
You followed him here?

437
00:55:30.533 --> 00:55:32.926
Francis thinks that
I'm overreacting.

438
00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.164
But he's been watching us
since we moved in.

439
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:38.505
Do you know him?

440
00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.372
I think he works here
as a cleaner.

441
00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:42.345
People come and go here
all the time.

442
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:44.677
I never really get a good look
at their faces.

443
00:55:44.712 --> 00:55:47.117
They all have
the same dumb expression,

444
00:55:47.153 --> 00:55:48.584
and they start to
blend together.

445
00:55:49.653 --> 00:55:52.115
Have you noticed anyone
watching you in your apartment?

446
00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:55.018
No.

447
00:55:55.054 --> 00:55:57.219
But maybe I've gotten used to
having eyes on me.

448
00:56:03.002 --> 00:56:04.699
Do I just sound paranoid?

449
00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.131
Let's just hope
you'll never find out.

450
00:56:09.239 --> 00:56:10.471
The best outcome might be

451
00:56:10.506 --> 00:56:12.300
having to live with
the uncertainty.

452
00:56:13.345 --> 00:56:15.910
Better than getting raped
and strangled,

453
00:56:15.945 --> 00:56:18.678
and dying with the words
"I told you so" on your lips.
Right?

454
00:56:22.848 --> 00:56:24.752
Sorry. I have to
get back to work.

455
00:56:30.458 --> 00:56:31.990
Thank you for looking after me.

456
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:35.158
I'll try and do
the same for you.

457
00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:53.896
-Irina?

458
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.300
-Irina?

459
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:59.907
-Irina?

460
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.510
I heard yelling. I heard
screaming from in here, okay?

461
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:10.651
-If we can just get
the key.

462
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.486
-He's hurting her, okay?

463
00:59:12.521 --> 00:59:14.024
Can we get the key, please?

464
00:59:15.854 --> 00:59:17.424
Just open the door, please!

465
00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:39.309
I heard the scream
from the bedroom.

466
01:00:01.171 --> 01:00:02.299
It was cat.

467
01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:14.652
Elvis. Elvis.

468
01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.468
What did she say?

469
01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.538
She said
she didn't want tenants
who created trouble.

470
01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:47.641
I can imagine.

471
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:54.516
I'm sorry I've been
working so much.

472
01:00:55.325 --> 01:00:56.655
It's your job.

473
01:00:57.224 --> 01:00:59.995
I know but
you moved here to be with me.

474
01:01:00.398 --> 01:01:02.524
Well, that's presumptuous.

475
01:01:03.194 --> 01:01:05.534
Maybe I've always
wanted to live

476
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.797
an aimless existence
in Bucharest

477
01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:09.034
smoking cigarettes

478
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:12.202
and scaring my neighbors
with my hysterics.

479
01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.536
You thought she needed help.
I don't blame you for it.

480
01:01:17.847 --> 01:01:20.482
I gotta go into work
for a few hours today,

481
01:01:20.517 --> 01:01:22.753
but we have cocktails tonight.

482
01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:26.383
-If you're up for it.
-Yeah, I'm good.

483
01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.797
Hi.
<i>Vorbesti engleza?</i>

484
01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.227
I was wondering if you know
a woman that works there?

485
01:01:36.263 --> 01:01:38.800
Her name's Irina.
She didn't come home last night

486
01:01:38.836 --> 01:01:41.038
and I was just wondering
if you've heard from her

487
01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:42.267
or seen her?

488
01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:48.779
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

489
01:02:00.524 --> 01:02:01.957
Are you looking for Irina?

490
01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:04.754
You know where she is?

491
01:02:05.223 --> 01:02:07.494
No, I just saw her last night
at work.

492
01:02:08.297 --> 01:02:11.131
We were supposed to meet
at my apartment
after she finished.

493
01:02:12.567 --> 01:02:13.804
She never came?

494
01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:18.574
It's not the first time,
but, no, she never came.

495
01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.707
Do you know
where she would be?

496
01:02:20.743 --> 01:02:22.144
I think she's inside.

497
01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:24.579
I don't think so.
I would have heard her come in.

498
01:02:24.614 --> 01:02:26.242
Do you have her phone number?

499
01:02:26.277 --> 01:02:28.778
Yeah, but...
she doesn't answer me.

500
01:02:29.214 --> 01:02:30.821
Do you mind if
I try and call her?

501
01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:32.823
Yeah.

502
01:02:48.835 --> 01:02:50.764
Mm-hm. You hear that?

503
01:03:00.184 --> 01:03:01.280
Wait.

504
01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:06.384
Could you help me
with something?

505
01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:28.104
So you want me to
knock on his door

506
01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:29.913
and get the guy to come out?

507
01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:33.081
Yeah, I just need to see him.

508
01:03:34.209 --> 01:03:35.949
-Why?

509
01:03:35.984 --> 01:03:37.880
I think that he's been
following me.

510
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:39.913
The police say
they can't do anything,

511
01:03:39.948 --> 01:03:43.153
but I need to know for myself
that it's the same person.

512
01:03:43.189 --> 01:03:45.929
-Fucking cops are useless.

513
01:03:57.243 --> 01:03:58.535
So which one?

514
01:03:59.972 --> 01:04:02.011
Hm... that's the corner.

515
01:04:04.514 --> 01:04:05.608
That one there.

516
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:07.610
Four doors down.

517
01:04:08.418 --> 01:04:09.513
On the left?

518
01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:11.119
Yeah.

519
01:04:34.172 --> 01:04:35.638
I think there is someone inside.

520
01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.981
But they don't answer.

521
01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:50.455
Uh, sorry, I gotta go.

522
01:04:51.519 --> 01:04:53.095
Can you just try one more time?

523
01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:55.999
Okay.

524
01:05:18.753 --> 01:05:21.024
Sorry. I tried.

525
01:05:21.823 --> 01:05:23.961
Wh-- What did you say?

526
01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:27.196
Uh...

527
01:05:27.565 --> 01:05:29.032
To stop bothering you.

528
01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:30.831
But don't worry.

529
01:05:31.066 --> 01:05:33.201
He probably has
a little crush on you.

530
01:05:36.739 --> 01:05:39.537
Um, if you see Irina,

531
01:05:40.106 --> 01:05:41.638
can you tell her that I came by?

532
01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:44.179
-Okay.

533
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:55.382
I'm sorry. Sorry.

534
01:07:58.814 --> 01:08:00.073
Julia?

535
01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:23.269
Julia, this is Daniel Weber.

536
01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:25.703
He lives in the building
across from you.

537
01:08:27.639 --> 01:08:30.310
Mr. Weber made a complaint
with us today

538
01:08:30.345 --> 01:08:32.779
about a neighbor who has been
harassing him.

539
01:08:33.314 --> 01:08:34.974
-Harassing him?
-Yeah.

540
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.747
Looking at his window,
following him around,

541
01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:40.448
showing up at his door and
threatening his father.

542
01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.656
And I remember Mr. Weber
from your complaint,

543
01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:47.264
and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.

544
01:08:47.299 --> 01:08:52.202
So if you both can agree that
this was misunderstanding,

545
01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:55.395
and, uh, that's not gonna go
any further,

546
01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.537
we can all go on with our lives.

547
01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.251
Let me know when they're gone.

548
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.694
You okay?

549
01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:02.965
I saw this today.

550
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:09.838
What is this?

551
01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.414
It says they caught
The Spider.

552
01:10:11.883 --> 01:10:13.415
Remember the guy who found her?

553
01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:15.112
He was a plumber.

554
01:10:15.447 --> 01:10:17.047
Did a job for the last victim.

555
01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:19.979
They found
a bunch of her clothes
in his apartment.

556
01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.786
He'd already been in prison
for rape.

557
01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.798
Simion. My wife, Julia.

558
01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:10.073
She is as beautiful
as you described her, Francis.

559
01:11:10.108 --> 01:11:11.933
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

560
01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:14.435
We were just talking about
the big news.

561
01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.511
Did Francis get a promotion?

562
01:11:17.246 --> 01:11:18.645
No, no,
they caught The Spider.

563
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.983
So Francis and Julia
live near one of the victims.

564
01:11:21.018 --> 01:11:22.479
So they saw the crime scene.

565
01:11:22.514 --> 01:11:24.217
We just walked past it, really.

566
01:11:24.252 --> 01:11:25.447
-Oh.
-That's all

567
01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.790
Francis said that
you are having some trouble

568
01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:37.895
with one of your neighbors.

569
01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:41.537
Maybe it was him.

570
01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.070
Can you imagine?

571
01:12:17.238 --> 01:12:18.441
What did you just say?

572
01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.906
It's just a stupid work joke.

573
01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:25.575
-What did he say?
-Jules. Come on.

574
01:12:25.978 --> 01:12:28.245
No, no, really, it was just
some office gossip.

575
01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:31.449
How about more champagne?
I need a refill.

576
01:12:31.484 --> 01:12:34.347
At least I have The Spider to...

577
01:12:35.993 --> 01:12:37.592
-To what?
-Julia.

578
01:12:38.559 --> 01:12:40.122
At least I have
The Spider to...

579
01:12:41.933 --> 01:12:43.400
to keep me company?

580
01:12:44.265 --> 01:12:45.435
Is that what you...

581
01:12:53.604 --> 01:12:54.906
At least I have that.

582
01:13:02.452 --> 01:13:03.752
Julia, where are you going?

583
01:13:04.188 --> 01:13:06.379
-Will you please stop?
-What?

584
01:13:07.849 --> 01:13:09.149
I can't take a joke?

585
01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.559
Is that what you're gonna
tell me right now?

586
01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.763
I don't know
what to do anymore, Julia.

587
01:13:20.871 --> 01:13:22.098
I'm tired.

588
01:13:24.405 --> 01:13:25.838
I'm tired of feeling like this

589
01:13:25.873 --> 01:13:28.335
because you can't let go of
some fuckin' fantasy.

590
01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:47.836
It's probably an animal.

591
01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:49.767
What?

592
01:17:49.803 --> 01:17:51.936
The cause of the delay.

593
01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:54.304
It could be signal problem
or repairs

594
01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.571
or sometimes it's because
an animal is on the tracks.

595
01:17:59.517 --> 01:18:01.811
There could be a couple
subway workers

596
01:18:01.847 --> 01:18:03.577
chasing a dog as we speak.

597
01:18:07.321 --> 01:18:09.049
So...

598
01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.556
how long does it take?

599
01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:12.390
To catch a dog?

600
01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:13.895
Not long.

601
01:18:14.528 --> 01:18:15.589
If you're fast.

602
01:18:19.493 --> 01:18:21.430
Usually, it just takes
a few minutes.

603
01:18:22.933 --> 01:18:24.532
Even if it seems longer.

604
01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:27.403
Thanks.

605
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:29.042
You're welcome.

606
01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:35.312
Why are you following me?

607
01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:38.612
I don't control the trains.

608
01:18:42.721 --> 01:18:43.826
Let me explain.

609
01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.492
I spend all day
looking after my father,

610
01:18:47.528 --> 01:18:48.831
he's very sick.

611
01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.494
And so sometimes I...

612
01:18:53.194 --> 01:18:55.101
go to the window and...

613
01:18:57.737 --> 01:18:59.468
just look at people...

614
01:19:00.443 --> 01:19:01.943
going about their day.

615
01:19:03.546 --> 01:19:05.980
I know it is a sad hobby.

616
01:19:08.982 --> 01:19:12.646
But no one
has really noticed before.

617
01:19:14.925 --> 01:19:18.190
"You've really become
sad old man now," I thought.

618
01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.857
Dreaming up a...

619
01:19:21.893 --> 01:19:24.367
pretty girl who's...

620
01:19:24.402 --> 01:19:27.463
finally looking back at you.

621
01:19:30.671 --> 01:19:32.204
But then you waved.

622
01:19:34.905 --> 01:19:36.939
And I thought...

623
01:19:36.974 --> 01:19:38.872
that you were saying...

624
01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:39.948
hello.

625
01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:45.983
That's why I was so--
so surprised

626
01:19:46.019 --> 01:19:48.918
when your husband
came to my door

627
01:19:48.953 --> 01:19:50.721
with the police officer.

628
01:19:50.757 --> 01:19:53.286
I did not understand

629
01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:55.128
what I had done
that was so bad.

630
01:19:56.357 --> 01:19:58.626
And why you kept following me.

631
01:20:00.002 --> 01:20:03.169
I wondered if you were
trying to embarrass me.

632
01:20:05.104 --> 01:20:08.303
Or if you were
trying to scare me...

633
01:20:08.338 --> 01:20:10.671
when you came to my door
with that man...

634
01:20:11.778 --> 01:20:15.346
and cursed at my father.

635
01:20:16.611 --> 01:20:19.587
I had hoped that
after I involved the police

636
01:20:19.622 --> 01:20:21.418
that would be the end of it.

637
01:20:21.687 --> 01:20:23.318
But I felt--

638
01:20:23.353 --> 01:20:25.389
I felt that
what I really needed...

639
01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.526
was an apology.

640
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:36.598
I'm sorry.

641
01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:39.187
Irina?

642
01:24:53.261 --> 01:24:55.531
Be careful about
breathing too hard.

643
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.134
I left enough holes
for you to get air,

644
01:24:58.169 --> 01:25:00.803
but you will pass out if you
start hyperventilating.

645
01:25:00.838 --> 01:25:02.869
-Or scream.

646
01:25:02.904 --> 01:25:04.772
Help! Help!

647
01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:06.607
-Shh. Shh.

648
01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.001
Irina screamed.

649
01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.038
We had to hide
in that closet...

650
01:25:13.247 --> 01:25:15.217
while you were all
looking around.

651
01:25:17.186 --> 01:25:19.947
For a moment, I was sure
that you'd see me.

652
01:25:23.153 --> 01:25:25.156
Imagine...

653
01:25:25.192 --> 01:25:27.196
how awkward that
would have been.

654
01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:41.301
Hello.

655
01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.553
-Julia?
-He--

656
01:26:25.082 --> 01:26:26.222
Julia?

657
01:26:41.395 --> 01:26:42.469
Fuck.

658
01:30:22.055 --> 01:30:23.118
Hey!
