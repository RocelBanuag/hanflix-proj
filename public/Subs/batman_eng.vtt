00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:29.708
Hey!

2
00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:59.279
...a dark
and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.286
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.

4
00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.911
Our top story tonight,

5
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.247
just-released polls

6
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.808
have incumbent
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

7
00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:12.292
And 28-year-old
grassroots challenger

8
00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:14.169
Bella Real in a dead heat.

9
00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:15.962
Things certainly
got hot last night

10
00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:19.299
in their final debate before
next Tuesday's election.

11
00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:21.092
Now, my young opponent here

12
00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:23.386
wants to gut
the Gotham Renewal Program,

13
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.305
established by
the great Thomas Wayne.

14
00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:27.098
Cutting funds
from vital projects

15
00:02:27.182 --> 00:02:28.516
like our seawall,

16
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.744
and the safety net
for those who need it.

17
00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:31.603
The Renewal Program is broken.

18
00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.772
This city's been renewing
for 20 years.

19
00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.733
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

20
00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:38.252
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

21
00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:39.778
Now wait... Now hang on.

22
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.661
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

23
00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:43.031
Under my administration,

24
00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:44.616
the Gotham PD
has dealt major blows

25
00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.618
to organized crime
and drug trafficking.

26
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.119
The Salvatore Maroni case

27
00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:50.038
was the biggest drug bust
in city history.

28
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.332
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

29
00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:53.851
- It's gotten worse.
- I'm not saying...

30
00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:55.102
I'm not saying
there isn't work to do.

31
00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:56.669
But listen...

32
00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:58.189
...I have a beautiful wife
and young son, okay?

33
00:02:58.213 --> 00:02:59.653
And I will not rest...

34
00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:04.552
Hey.

35
00:03:07.013 --> 00:03:08.765
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

36
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.855
Why is she still tied?

37
00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:20.068
But...

38
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:23.446
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

39
00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:31.663
Okay, you know what?

40
00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:33.099
I can't...
I can't watch this anymore.

41
00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:34.874
Just call me
in the morning, okay?

42
00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.337
...who still believes

43
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.839
in everything this city can do.

44
00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:41.982
We need a leader,
Mr. Mitchell,

45
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.508
not a cheerleader.

46
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:45.844
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

47
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.092
Thursday, October 31st.

48
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.358
The city streets
are crowded for the holiday.

49
00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:28.112
Even with the rain.

50
00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:35.912
Hidden in the chaos
is the element

51
00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:38.164
waiting to strike like snakes.

52
00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:41.167
But I'm there too.

53
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.920
Watching.

54
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:47.215
Two years of nights

55
00:05:47.298 --> 00:05:49.884
have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.

56
00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:58.059
I must choose
my targets carefully.

57
00:06:11.406 --> 00:06:12.490
Come on!

58
00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:14.450
- Give me the money.
- Okay.

59
00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:16.303
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

60
00:06:16.327 --> 00:06:17.912
It's a big city.

61
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:24.252
I can't be everywhere.

62
00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.723
But they don't know where I am.

63
00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:43.646
Look at this guy, man.

64
00:06:48.943 --> 00:06:51.404
- Boom!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

65
00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:56.760
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

66
00:06:56.784 --> 00:06:58.344
Yo, let's see your hits.

67
00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:00.455
That's you.

68
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:24.812
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

69
00:07:26.314 --> 00:07:29.484
But when that light
hits the sky,

70
00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:31.652
it's not just a call.

71
00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:34.781
It's a warning.

72
00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:37.575
To them.

73
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:49.087
Fear...

74
00:07:51.714 --> 00:07:53.591
...is a tool.

75
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.062
Are you
out of your mind?

76
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:07.855
Watch where you're goin',
drophead!

77
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.161
They think
I'm hiding in the shadows.

78
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.207
Come on!

79
00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.508
But I am the shadows.

80
00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:56.380
Come on, come on.

81
00:08:56.404 --> 00:08:58.281
Whoo.

82
00:08:58.364 --> 00:08:59.633
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

83
00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:01.868
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

84
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.286
Help!

85
00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:04.620
Somebody help me!

86
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:07.415
Help, help!

87
00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:15.774
Where you goin', huh?

88
00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:22.972
- Come on.
- Come on, man. Break it.

89
00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:26.767
You can't move, huh?

90
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:28.561
Now knock his ass out.

91
00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:30.855
Showtime. Showtime, man.

92
00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.023
Come on, man.

93
00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:33.399
Come on. Do it, man.

94
00:10:08.893 --> 00:10:10.561
You see this guy?

95
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:19.153
The hell are you supposed to be?

96
00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:37.463
I'm vengeance.

97
00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:40.466
Holy shit. It's him.

98
00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:07.535
Hey, man. No, no, no!

99
00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.369
Please don't hurt me.

100
00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:28.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:12:29.283 --> 00:12:31.160
Police action.

102
00:12:31.243 --> 00:12:32.995
He's with me, Officer.

103
00:12:35.164 --> 00:12:37.541
Are you kidding me, sir?

104
00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:40.044
You're gonna let him in here?

105
00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:43.005
Martinez, let him through.

106
00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:58.521
Goddamn freak.

107
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.287
What do we know?

108
00:13:26.048 --> 00:13:27.758
Detective?

109
00:13:27.842 --> 00:13:30.094
Sorry, Lieutenant.

110
00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:35.433
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

111
00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:38.811
He got hit a lot of times.
And hard.

112
00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:43.983
All this blood is from his head?

113
00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:45.067
No.

114
00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:50.614
Excuse me.

115
00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:54.785
Most of it's from his hand.

116
00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:01.292
Thumb was severed.

117
00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:05.212
Killer may have taken it
as a trophy.

118
00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:07.381
He was alive
when it was cut off.

119
00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.218
Ecchymosis

120
00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:12.887
around the wound.

121
00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:29.546
Security detail downstairs

122
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.114
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

123
00:14:33.532 --> 00:14:35.826
The mayor was up here alone.

124
00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:40.956
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

125
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:49.006
You said
there was a card.

126
00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:50.758
Yeah.

127
00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:03.938
"From your
secret friend. Whoo?"

128
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:06.816
Haven't a clue?

129
00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:10.194
Let's play a game,
just me and you.

130
00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.988
"What does a liar do
when he's dead?"

131
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.408
There's a cipher too.

132
00:15:22.998 --> 00:15:25.042
Any of this
mean anything to you?

133
00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:28.796
What's going on here?

134
00:15:31.757 --> 00:15:33.175
I asked him to come, Pete.

135
00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:35.052
This is a crime scene.

136
00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:37.388
It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!

137
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.348
I got the press downstairs.

138
00:15:39.431 --> 00:15:41.267
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack, Jim,

139
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.350
'cause we got history.

140
00:15:42.393 --> 00:15:44.270
But this is way over the line.

141
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.275
Wait.

142
00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:50.877
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

143
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:52.194
How do you know?

144
00:15:52.278 --> 00:15:55.030
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

145
00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:56.800
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

146
00:15:56.824 --> 00:15:58.677
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

147
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:00.286
He lies still.

148
00:16:01.787 --> 00:16:02.788
Excuse me?

149
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:05.749
The riddle.

150
00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:08.127
What does a liar do
when he's dead?

151
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.420
He lies still.

152
00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.014
Oh, Jesus.

153
00:16:23.017 --> 00:16:26.061
This must be your favorite
night of the year, huh, pal?

154
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.440
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

155
00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:32.151
Excuse me,
Commissioner.

156
00:16:32.234 --> 00:16:34.069
They're ready
for your statement.

157
00:16:38.032 --> 00:16:39.825
I want him outta here.

158
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:41.535
Now!

159
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:49.335
Come on.

160
00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:03.307
Yeah.

161
00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:05.976
The kid found him.

162
00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:12.041
Was there anyone else

163
00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:13.983
in the house when you arrived?

164
00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:32.586
We really gotta go, man.

165
00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:42.262
Tonight,
a son lost a father.

166
00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.264
A wife lost a husband.

167
00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:47.685
And I lost a friend.

168
00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:50.312
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter
for the city,

169
00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:53.857
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

170
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:56.860
This was
a truly senseless crime,

171
00:17:56.944 --> 00:17:58.237
and we are actively pursuing

172
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.322
every investigative lead we have

173
00:18:00.406 --> 00:18:03.075
in order to identify
the perpetrator

174
00:18:03.158 --> 00:18:04.535
and hunt him down.

175
00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:06.203
I've spoken to the governor...

176
00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.831
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

177
00:18:08.914 --> 00:18:10.457
but I don't know.

178
00:18:16.338 --> 00:18:19.174
Murder, robberies, assault.

179
00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:22.136
Two years later, they're all up.

180
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:23.595
And now this.

181
00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:27.349
The city's eating itself.

182
00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:31.311
Maybe it's beyond saving.

183
00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:35.691
But I have to try.

184
00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:37.860
Push myself.

185
00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:26.617
These nights
all roll together in a rush,

186
00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.495
behind the mask.

187
00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:36.293
Sometimes in the morning,

188
00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:40.214
I have to force myself
to remember

189
00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:44.176
everything that happened.

190
00:19:57.564 --> 00:19:59.441
Unbelievable breaking news

191
00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:01.068
this hour, everyone.

192
00:20:01.151 --> 00:20:04.029
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

193
00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:06.949
Was found murdered last night
inside his home

194
00:20:07.032 --> 00:20:08.826
in the exclusive
Crest Hill district.

195
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:10.869
Exact details of the crime

196
00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:12.371
still have not been released,

197
00:20:12.454 --> 00:20:15.124
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

198
00:20:15.207 --> 00:20:18.460
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

199
00:20:18.544 --> 00:20:20.587
And this certainly
is not the first time

200
00:20:20.671 --> 00:20:21.964
Gotham has been rocked

201
00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:23.447
by the murder
of a political figure.

202
00:20:23.507 --> 00:20:25.300
In fact,
in an eerie coincidence,

203
00:20:25.384 --> 00:20:27.427
it was 20 years ago this week

204
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:29.151
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

205
00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:31.140
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha

206
00:20:31.223 --> 00:20:34.226
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

207
00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:35.602
It was a shocking crime

208
00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:38.021
that remains unsolved
to this day.

209
00:20:38.105 --> 00:20:39.940
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s
political career

210
00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:42.776
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

211
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.111
when he and city police

212
00:20:44.194 --> 00:20:46.113
launched a major sting operation

213
00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:47.739
resulting in the arrest

214
00:20:47.823 --> 00:20:50.159
of notorious mafia crime
figure Salvatore Maroni,

215
00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:51.743
with what, to this day,

216
00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:54.413
remains the biggest drug bust
in GCPD history.

217
00:20:54.496 --> 00:20:55.789
I assume you heard about this.

218
00:20:57.749 --> 00:20:59.126
Yeah.

219
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:07.926
Oh, I see.

220
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.179
All this
blood is from his head?

221
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:11.930
Dear God.

222
00:21:20.522 --> 00:21:22.733
There's a cipher too.

223
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.660
Any of this
mean anything to you?

224
00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:37.998
The killer left this
for the Batman?

225
00:21:39.249 --> 00:21:41.043
I asked him to come, Pete.

226
00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:42.252
Apparently.

227
00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:44.338
You're becoming
quite a celebrity.

228
00:21:46.256 --> 00:21:47.549
Why is he writing to you?

229
00:21:47.633 --> 00:21:49.176
It's Mitchell,
for christ sakes!

230
00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:50.510
I don't know yet.

231
00:21:50.594 --> 00:21:51.929
I got the press
downstairs.

232
00:21:53.764 --> 00:21:55.224
Have a shower.

233
00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:58.227
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

234
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.394
are coming for breakfast.

235
00:21:59.478 --> 00:22:01.188
Here? Why?

236
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:02.940
Because I couldn't get you
to go there.

237
00:22:03.023 --> 00:22:05.442
- I haven't got time for this.
- It's getting serious, Bruce.

238
00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:06.777
If this continues,

239
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.612
it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

240
00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:10.364
I don't care about that.

241
00:22:11.073 --> 00:22:12.324
Any of that.

242
00:22:12.407 --> 00:22:14.047
You don't care
about your family's legacy?

243
00:22:16.078 --> 00:22:19.289
What I'm doing
is my family's legacy.

244
00:22:19.373 --> 00:22:21.959
If I can't change things here,

245
00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:24.920
if I can't have an effect,

246
00:22:25.003 --> 00:22:26.797
then I don't care
what happens to me.

247
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.006
That's what I'm afraid of.

248
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.633
Alfred, stop.

249
00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:32.511
You're not my father.

250
00:22:35.264 --> 00:22:36.723
I'm well aware.

251
00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:13.260
We really gotta go, man.

252
00:23:38.994 --> 00:23:40.662
Some fresh berries there.

253
00:23:47.627 --> 00:23:48.962
What are you doing?

254
00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:53.216
Just reminiscing about my days
in the Circus.

255
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.304
This is
actually quite elusive.

256
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.808
Where'd you get those O's?

257
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.146
"He lies still"
is only a partial key.

258
00:24:06.229 --> 00:24:08.565
It only gives us
H, E, I, I, S, and T.

259
00:24:08.648 --> 00:24:11.818
So, I'm looking for
any double symbols to start,

260
00:24:11.902 --> 00:24:12.986
trying letters,

261
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.404
see where it leads.

262
00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:17.282
That's interesting.

263
00:24:18.492 --> 00:24:19.951
Mr. Pennyworth?

264
00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:21.203
Yes, Dory?

265
00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:22.746
The accountants are here.

266
00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:24.748
See them in, please, Dory.

267
00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:29.920
What if
it's not a partial key?

268
00:24:30.003 --> 00:24:31.463
What do you mean?

269
00:24:31.546 --> 00:24:34.049
What if this is the whole key?

270
00:24:34.132 --> 00:24:36.718
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

271
00:24:36.802 --> 00:24:38.402
Use only the letters
from "He lies still"

272
00:24:38.428 --> 00:24:40.156
- and leave the rest...
- Blank. Yeah, I understand.

273
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.432
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

274
00:24:42.516 --> 00:24:44.267
I don't see how that's gonna...

275
00:24:46.937 --> 00:24:47.938
Oh.

276
00:25:01.535 --> 00:25:03.120
Damn.

277
00:25:03.203 --> 00:25:06.456
Yeah, he's got a car.

278
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.000
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

279
00:25:09.084 --> 00:25:11.002
Where to even start?

280
00:25:11.086 --> 00:25:13.964
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

281
00:25:14.047 --> 00:25:15.632
You don't trust me?

282
00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:17.384
You mean like you trust me?

283
00:25:17.467 --> 00:25:18.677
It's been two years now,

284
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.429
and I don't even know
who you are, man.

285
00:25:22.222 --> 00:25:23.432
There.

286
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.415
What are we looking for?

287
00:25:48.498 --> 00:25:50.083
A USB port.

288
00:25:50.167 --> 00:25:51.251
USB?

289
00:25:58.383 --> 00:25:59.551
What?

290
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.184
"Thumb" drive.

291
00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:09.603
Jesus.

292
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.733
It's encrypted.

293
00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:19.446
Try this.

294
00:26:26.328 --> 00:26:28.788
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

295
00:26:37.547 --> 00:26:40.509
Oh, well, well, well.

296
00:26:40.592 --> 00:26:42.969
So much for family values.

297
00:26:43.053 --> 00:26:44.346
Who is she?

298
00:26:44.429 --> 00:26:46.556
No idea.

299
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.726
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

300
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.853
I know who he is.

301
00:26:51.937 --> 00:26:52.979
What was that?

302
00:26:54.105 --> 00:26:58.068
Shit, shit, shit! The drive.

303
00:26:58.151 --> 00:27:00.529
It sent out the photos
from my account.

304
00:27:00.612 --> 00:27:03.406
Gotham Post, Gazette,
GC-1, all of them.

305
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.200
Jesus.

306
00:27:05.283 --> 00:27:07.911
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

307
00:27:07.994 --> 00:27:09.496
"He lies still."

308
00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:10.664
About her?

309
00:27:11.915 --> 00:27:13.500
Maybe.

310
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:15.377
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

311
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.880
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

312
00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:21.258
Never get in there
without a warrant.

313
00:27:23.593 --> 00:27:24.678
Yeah.

314
00:27:37.732 --> 00:27:38.984
Know who I am?

315
00:27:40.235 --> 00:27:42.862
Yeah. I got an idea.

316
00:27:42.946 --> 00:27:44.906
I want to see the Penguin.

317
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.409
I don't know what
you're talking about, pal.

318
00:27:52.706 --> 00:27:53.832
What's the problem?

319
00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:55.208
Says he wants
to see the Penguin.

320
00:27:55.292 --> 00:27:57.335
Penguin?
There's no Penguin here.

321
00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:59.045
That's what I tried to tell him.

322
00:27:59.129 --> 00:28:01.339
Get out of here, freak.
You hear me?

323
00:28:01.423 --> 00:28:03.550
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

324
00:28:04.884 --> 00:28:06.011
Mine or yours?

325
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:15.269
Get him!

326
00:28:15.312 --> 00:28:16.539
I saw that whole thing.

327
00:28:16.563 --> 00:28:17.731
He's over there!

328
00:28:17.814 --> 00:28:19.274
What is your problem?

329
00:28:22.652 --> 00:28:23.653
Yo!

330
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.069
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

331
00:29:14.663 --> 00:29:16.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:18.208
Take it easy, sweetheart.

333
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:20.710
You looking for me?

334
00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:23.380
I see you met the twins.

335
00:29:23.463 --> 00:29:27.050
Boy, you're everything
they say, ain't ya?

336
00:29:27.842 --> 00:29:29.427
I guess we both are.

337
00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:33.390
How you doing?

338
00:29:33.473 --> 00:29:35.809
I'm Oz.

339
00:29:40.438 --> 00:29:41.648
Who is she?

340
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.112
I really don't know, chief.

341
00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:50.240
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

342
00:29:50.323 --> 00:29:51.550
but I wasn't rolling with them.

343
00:30:04.838 --> 00:30:06.131
It's okay, baby.

344
00:30:06.214 --> 00:30:10.176
Mr. Vengeance here,
he don't bite. Come on.

345
00:30:35.618 --> 00:30:37.746
Thank you, honey.

346
00:30:43.543 --> 00:30:45.336
Here you go, champ.

347
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.255
I wanna know who she is,

348
00:30:47.338 --> 00:30:49.048
and what she has to do
with this murder.

349
00:30:49.132 --> 00:30:51.301
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

350
00:30:51.384 --> 00:30:52.677
Is that the mayor?

351
00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:54.679
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

352
00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:57.140
Don't make me hurt you.

353
00:30:57.223 --> 00:31:01.352
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

354
00:31:01.436 --> 00:31:04.481
Yeah, I do. Do you?

355
00:31:06.232 --> 00:31:07.734
Look...

356
00:31:08.902 --> 00:31:12.447
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

357
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.783
I mean, what people do here

358
00:31:14.866 --> 00:31:16.910
ain't got nothing to do with me.

359
00:31:25.126 --> 00:31:26.795
Tell you one thing.

360
00:31:28.797 --> 00:31:32.842
Whoever she is,
she's one hot chick.

361
00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:34.427
Why don't you ask
Mitchell's wife?

362
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:35.553
Maybe she knows.

363
00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:40.600
What? Too soon?

364
00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:53.613
You let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

365
00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:06.626
Taxi!

366
00:32:25.353 --> 00:32:26.271
Hey, it's me.

367
00:32:27.897 --> 00:32:29.440
Baby, what's wrong?

368
00:32:29.524 --> 00:32:31.985
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down,
slow down. I can't...

369
00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:36.239
On the news?

370
00:32:36.322 --> 00:32:39.659
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

371
00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:41.327
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

372
00:32:42.704 --> 00:32:44.080
Listen, baby,

373
00:32:44.163 --> 00:32:46.749
we're gonna get the hell
out of here, okay? I promise.

374
00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:50.295
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

375
00:32:50.378 --> 00:32:51.588
Uh...

376
00:32:53.965 --> 00:32:55.341
God damn it.

377
00:33:14.611 --> 00:33:16.279
...photos
of murdered mayor,

378
00:33:16.362 --> 00:33:19.115
Don Mitchell, Jr.
With a younger mystery woman.

379
00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:20.617
In a shocking development,

380
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.177
the police believe
the photos themselves...

381
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:58.529
Now they urge her
to contact the GCPD...

382
00:36:12.997 --> 00:36:14.457
You're pretty good at that.

383
00:36:45.696 --> 00:36:47.949
Hey! Give me that.

384
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.996
"Kosolov, Annika."

385
00:36:55.414 --> 00:36:57.500
He hurt her?
That's why you killed him?

386
00:36:57.583 --> 00:37:00.378
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

387
00:37:38.624 --> 00:37:41.252
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

388
00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:43.754
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

389
00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:45.357
She's trying to get
the hell out of here,

390
00:37:45.381 --> 00:37:47.300
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

391
00:37:47.383 --> 00:37:48.676
What does she know?

392
00:37:48.759 --> 00:37:49.862
Whatever it is,
it's got her so spooked

393
00:37:49.886 --> 00:37:50.970
she won't even tell me.

394
00:37:51.053 --> 00:37:52.597
She did seem upset.

395
00:37:54.307 --> 00:37:55.892
Back at your place.

396
00:37:57.852 --> 00:37:59.437
Let's go talk to her.

397
00:38:25.588 --> 00:38:26.672
Anni!

398
00:38:27.965 --> 00:38:29.050
Baby!

399
00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:37.475
Anni!

400
00:38:39.268 --> 00:38:40.829
It's gonna
be cool this evening.

401
00:38:40.853 --> 00:38:43.397
It's gonna be down into the 40s.

402
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:45.233
More
breaking news this hour,

403
00:38:45.316 --> 00:38:48.986
as the city is rocked by
a second high-profile murder

404
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.488
in as many nights.

405
00:38:50.571 --> 00:38:51.840
And this time, the killer
has come forward

406
00:38:51.864 --> 00:38:52.990
to claim credit online...

407
00:38:53.074 --> 00:38:54.509
Jesus, what are they
gonna do to her?

408
00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:55.826
She's just a kid.

409
00:38:58.204 --> 00:38:59.681
- Shit, they took my phone.
- His victim,

410
00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:00.849
longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,

411
00:39:00.873 --> 00:39:02.291
Commissioner Pete Savage,

412
00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:04.377
was found dead earlier tonight

413
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.379
inside the Police
Athletic League facilities

414
00:39:06.462 --> 00:39:07.880
in the Tricorner area.

415
00:39:07.964 --> 00:39:10.174
The killer posted
the following message

416
00:39:10.258 --> 00:39:11.884
on social media,

417
00:39:11.968 --> 00:39:14.095
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.

418
00:39:19.183 --> 00:39:21.978
Hello, people of Gotham.

419
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.146
This is the Riddler speaking.

420
00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:27.191
On Halloween night,

421
00:39:27.275 --> 00:39:28.651
I killed your mayor

422
00:39:28.734 --> 00:39:32.238
because he was not
who he pretended to be.

423
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:34.991
But I am not done.

424
00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:39.537
Here is another...

425
00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:46.669
...who will soon
be losing face.

426
00:39:48.212 --> 00:39:52.341
I will kill again,
and again, and again

427
00:39:52.425 --> 00:39:54.093
until our day of judgment

428
00:39:54.176 --> 00:40:00.016
when the truth about our city
will finally

429
00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:02.226
be unmasked.

430
00:40:03.769 --> 00:40:05.438
Goodbye!

431
00:40:09.608 --> 00:40:11.086
Commissioner Savage served

432
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.529
a distinguished 30-year career
on the GCPD...

433
00:40:13.613 --> 00:40:15.948
Holy shit, I seen that guy, too.

434
00:40:17.575 --> 00:40:18.617
At the club.

435
00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:21.370
The Iceberg Lounge?

436
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:23.581
44 Below.

437
00:40:25.458 --> 00:40:26.500
What is that?

438
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.297
The club within the club.

439
00:40:32.214 --> 00:40:34.300
The real club.

440
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.637
It's a mob hangout.

441
00:40:38.721 --> 00:40:40.181
Is that where you work?

442
00:40:42.558 --> 00:40:43.559
Selina?

443
00:40:48.814 --> 00:40:50.858
No, I just work
the bar upstairs.

444
00:40:54.111 --> 00:40:55.863
But I see 'em come in.

445
00:40:55.946 --> 00:40:57.406
Who?

446
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.633
A lot of guys
that shouldn't be there,

447
00:40:58.657 --> 00:41:00.034
I can tell you that.

448
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.455
Your basic
upstanding citizen types.

449
00:41:06.624 --> 00:41:08.250
You're gonna help me on this.

450
00:41:08.918 --> 00:41:10.419
For your friend.

451
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.348
You got a lot of cats.

452
00:41:23.724 --> 00:41:25.768
I have a thing about strays.

453
00:41:29.855 --> 00:41:31.232
You're not safe here.

454
00:41:32.274 --> 00:41:33.317
I can take care of myself.

455
00:41:33.401 --> 00:41:34.777
Two public figures

456
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.300
now dead in just
the last two nights,

457
00:41:36.362 --> 00:41:37.947
and only days
before the election.

458
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.281
Police and city officials

459
00:41:39.365 --> 00:41:41.158
are left searching for a killer

460
00:41:41.242 --> 00:41:44.412
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

461
00:42:02.138 --> 00:42:06.308
He waited for him at the gym.

462
00:42:06.392 --> 00:42:08.519
Pete always liked
to work out late at night,

463
00:42:08.602 --> 00:42:11.689
when no one else was around.

464
00:42:11.772 --> 00:42:13.274
There's a needle mark
on his neck.

465
00:42:13.357 --> 00:42:15.401
Injected him with arsenic.

466
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:18.738
Rat poison.

467
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.073
Yeah.

468
00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:24.160
That seems to be his theme here.

469
00:42:24.243 --> 00:42:25.536
Look at this thing.

470
00:42:33.752 --> 00:42:35.379
It's a maze.

471
00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:39.633
What kind of demented
son of a bitch

472
00:42:39.717 --> 00:42:41.385
does this to a person?

473
00:42:44.096 --> 00:42:45.222
More symbols.

474
00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.059
It's another cipher.

475
00:42:49.143 --> 00:42:52.521
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

476
00:42:52.605 --> 00:42:55.232
Bastard murders you
and your reputation.

477
00:42:55.316 --> 00:42:58.611
That guy pushes drops.
On the east end.

478
00:43:00.112 --> 00:43:01.572
I don't get it.

479
00:43:01.655 --> 00:43:03.991
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

480
00:43:04.825 --> 00:43:06.827
Looks like he got greedy.

481
00:43:06.911 --> 00:43:08.245
You kidding me?

482
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:10.664
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

483
00:43:10.748 --> 00:43:12.124
We busted
their entire operation,

484
00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:14.126
then he caves
to some lowlife dealer?

485
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.420
Maybe he's not who you thought.

486
00:43:17.796 --> 00:43:20.007
You make it sound
like he had it coming.

487
00:43:22.218 --> 00:43:23.719
He was a cop.

488
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.347
Crossed a line.

489
00:43:57.503 --> 00:43:59.004
"I'm mad about you.

490
00:43:59.088 --> 00:44:02.967
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

491
00:44:09.932 --> 00:44:13.018
"Follow the maze
until you find the rat.

492
00:44:13.102 --> 00:44:16.897
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

493
00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:19.191
The hell is that?

494
00:44:19.275 --> 00:44:22.653
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

495
00:44:23.737 --> 00:44:25.281
I don't know.

496
00:44:26.073 --> 00:44:27.283
Lieutenant.

497
00:44:27.366 --> 00:44:28.659
They're coming back.

498
00:44:28.742 --> 00:44:30.327
We got
to get out of here.

499
00:44:34.498 --> 00:44:35.708
Come on.

500
00:44:40.838 --> 00:44:41.880
Ow.

501
00:44:43.215 --> 00:44:44.633
I don't know about these things.

502
00:44:44.717 --> 00:44:48.178
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

503
00:44:52.057 --> 00:44:54.852
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

504
00:44:56.645 --> 00:44:58.188
I'm just looking for Annika.

505
00:45:02.359 --> 00:45:04.945
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

506
00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:06.464
You really don't care
what happens to me

507
00:45:06.488 --> 00:45:07.740
in there tonight, do you?

508
00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:18.584
Look at me.

509
00:45:28.177 --> 00:45:30.387
Looks good. Here.

510
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.516
I got you. Can you hear me?

511
00:46:16.475 --> 00:46:17.476
Yeah.

512
00:46:26.026 --> 00:46:27.611
Hey, where you goin'?

513
00:46:27.695 --> 00:46:29.405
Hospitality.

514
00:46:29.488 --> 00:46:30.823
That's one of the guys

515
00:46:30.906 --> 00:46:32.449
I got into it with
the other night.

516
00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:35.619
Looks like I broke his nose.

517
00:46:42.334 --> 00:46:44.420
"Kenzie, William."

518
00:46:44.503 --> 00:46:46.046
He's an off-duty cop.

519
00:46:47.673 --> 00:46:49.758
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

520
00:46:49.842 --> 00:46:51.969
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

521
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.739
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

522
00:47:11.822 --> 00:47:12.823
Great.

523
00:47:19.913 --> 00:47:21.182
These guys have a little problem

524
00:47:21.206 --> 00:47:22.416
with eye contact, don't they?

525
00:47:22.499 --> 00:47:23.917
Feels good, doesn't it?

526
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:26.336
Yeah, baby.
Feels real good.

527
00:47:32.217 --> 00:47:33.969
Jesus,
I hate dropheads.

528
00:47:34.052 --> 00:47:35.052
Really?

529
00:47:35.095 --> 00:47:36.472
'Cause when I first saw you,

530
00:47:36.555 --> 00:47:38.032
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

531
00:47:38.056 --> 00:47:38.849
You don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:47:38.932 --> 00:47:40.225
Can we not...

533
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:42.186
Can we not do this right now?

534
00:47:44.062 --> 00:47:45.731
Wait. Who was that?

535
00:47:45.814 --> 00:47:46.814
Oh, I saw him.

536
00:47:46.857 --> 00:47:48.317
Look back.

537
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.003
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

538
00:47:50.027 --> 00:47:51.320
I need to see his face.

539
00:47:52.905 --> 00:47:54.448
Jesus.

540
00:48:02.414 --> 00:48:03.582
That's the DA.

541
00:48:03.665 --> 00:48:04.750
Gil Colson.

542
00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:06.502
And he's coming over.
You happy?

543
00:48:06.585 --> 00:48:07.795
Talk to him.

544
00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:11.965
Hey. How you doing?

545
00:48:12.049 --> 00:48:14.092
- Hi.
- I'm Gil.

546
00:48:15.177 --> 00:48:17.888
- Hey, aren't you the DA?
- Yeah.

547
00:48:17.971 --> 00:48:20.307
Wow.
I've seen you on TV.

548
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.975
Is that right?

549
00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:25.187
I haven't seen you
around here before.

550
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.314
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl

551
00:48:27.397 --> 00:48:29.858
'cause people
are all a little on edge.

552
00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:31.462
Oh, honey,
I live on the edge.

553
00:48:31.527 --> 00:48:32.962
Is that right?

554
00:48:32.986 --> 00:48:34.446
I like that.

555
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:35.781
Do you want to come over?

556
00:48:35.864 --> 00:48:36.865
Sure.

557
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:41.203
- This is Travis.
- Hey.

558
00:48:41.286 --> 00:48:42.806
You wanna take a seat
over there?

559
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:44.873
- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.

560
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.709
That's half the DA's office.

561
00:48:47.793 --> 00:48:49.044
You know Carla here, huh?

562
00:48:49.127 --> 00:48:50.838
- Hi.
- That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

563
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:52.214
she's just taking a break.

564
00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:54.383
Drowning our sorrows.

565
00:48:54.466 --> 00:48:55.801
You want a drop?

566
00:48:55.884 --> 00:48:57.886
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

567
00:48:59.847 --> 00:49:01.348
Hope you don't mind.

568
00:49:01.431 --> 00:49:02.683
I got a lot on my shoulders

569
00:49:02.766 --> 00:49:04.059
with that psycho running around.

570
00:49:04.142 --> 00:49:05.143
He's wasted.

571
00:49:05.227 --> 00:49:06.728
No shit.

572
00:49:06.812 --> 00:49:09.231
I like this girl.

573
00:49:09.314 --> 00:49:10.941
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

574
00:49:14.403 --> 00:49:16.071
I mean, this Riddler,

575
00:49:16.154 --> 00:49:17.799
he's going after the most
powerful people in the city.

576
00:49:17.823 --> 00:49:19.074
He knows so much.

577
00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:20.510
He doesn't
know shit, man.

578
00:49:20.534 --> 00:49:21.827
What are you
talking about?

579
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.304
Yeah, he does!
What about that rat...

580
00:49:23.328 --> 00:49:24.872
Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

581
00:49:24.955 --> 00:49:26.599
- Hey. The rat.
- Think maybe you had

582
00:49:26.623 --> 00:49:28.823
- a little too much. Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.

583
00:49:29.543 --> 00:49:31.587
Hey,
what's this about a rat?

584
00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:43.682
I mean,

585
00:49:43.765 --> 00:49:47.811
there was a rat.
We had an informant.

586
00:49:47.895 --> 00:49:50.314
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

587
00:49:50.397 --> 00:49:52.208
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

588
00:49:52.232 --> 00:49:53.775
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

589
00:49:53.859 --> 00:49:57.696
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

590
00:49:57.779 --> 00:49:59.114
And when it does,

591
00:49:59.197 --> 00:50:00.300
this whole city's
gonna come apart.

592
00:50:00.324 --> 00:50:02.117
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

593
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.619
This is the kind of pillow talk

594
00:50:03.702 --> 00:50:05.013
that got that Russian girl
disappeared.

595
00:50:05.037 --> 00:50:07.581
What do you know about that?

596
00:50:07.664 --> 00:50:10.167
- Does anybody want a drink?
- I want a drink.

597
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.543
Keep him talking.

598
00:50:14.379 --> 00:50:16.798
- Wait, where are you going?
- She knows Annika.

599
00:50:16.882 --> 00:50:18.175
No, stay on the DA.

600
00:50:18.258 --> 00:50:20.344
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

601
00:50:22.262 --> 00:50:23.305
Where's Annika?

602
00:50:23.388 --> 00:50:24.723
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

603
00:50:24.806 --> 00:50:26.075
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

604
00:50:26.099 --> 00:50:27.517
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

605
00:50:27.601 --> 00:50:28.786
Jesus Christ,
keep your voice down.

606
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:30.103
What, you got a death wish?

607
00:50:30.187 --> 00:50:32.022
Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

608
00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:34.983
There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

609
00:50:35.067 --> 00:50:36.711
Let's keep it festive
down here, all right?

610
00:50:36.735 --> 00:50:37.945
Sure thing, Oz.

611
00:50:42.699 --> 00:50:46.328
Hey.

612
00:50:46.411 --> 00:50:49.748
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

613
00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:52.250
How you been?

614
00:50:54.503 --> 00:50:56.296
Yeah, I've been okay.

615
00:50:57.547 --> 00:50:59.007
I was just, um...

616
00:51:00.926 --> 00:51:02.844
I was just headed back upstairs.

617
00:51:02.928 --> 00:51:04.638
Mm. Well,

618
00:51:05.639 --> 00:51:07.391
don't be a stranger.

619
00:51:21.196 --> 00:51:23.615
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

620
00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:25.259
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

621
00:51:25.283 --> 00:51:27.202
I don't have a relationship
with him, okay?

622
00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:28.725
Well, that's not
what it looked like.

623
00:51:28.787 --> 00:51:30.455
- Forget it.
- Wait, what are you doing?

624
00:51:30.539 --> 00:51:31.766
Listen,
I can't do this anymore.

625
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:32.874
No! No!

626
00:51:37.504 --> 00:51:38.505
Taxi!

627
00:51:42.467 --> 00:51:43.510
Hey!

628
00:51:45.137 --> 00:51:46.263
I lost you in there.

629
00:51:46.346 --> 00:51:47.472
Yeah, I gotta go.

630
00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:50.308
Oh, you need a ride?

631
00:51:50.392 --> 00:51:51.685
That's me right there.

632
00:51:57.816 --> 00:51:58.900
Taxi!

633
00:51:58.984 --> 00:52:00.110
I'm good.

634
00:52:02.029 --> 00:52:03.488
I hope, uh...

635
00:52:08.035 --> 00:52:09.675
I'll see you around.

636
00:53:35.747 --> 00:53:39.543
Just hold still.

637
00:54:37.851 --> 00:54:39.996
What do you know
about a confidential informant

638
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.396
in the Maroni case?

639
00:54:44.733 --> 00:54:46.985
Yeah, sure, there was.

640
00:54:47.068 --> 00:54:49.738
That's the rat
we're looking for.

641
00:54:49.821 --> 00:54:52.157
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

642
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.410
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

643
00:54:55.493 --> 00:54:56.953
Where are you getting this?

644
00:54:57.037 --> 00:54:59.915
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

645
00:55:00.707 --> 00:55:02.834
Gil's very nervous.

646
00:55:02.918 --> 00:55:05.629
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

647
00:55:05.712 --> 00:55:07.505
I worked that case.

648
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:10.926
- Riddler's not after you.
- How do you know?

649
00:55:11.009 --> 00:55:12.510
You're not corrupt.

650
00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:15.096
Colson's dirty?

651
00:55:20.936 --> 00:55:22.854
Maybe I, uh...

652
00:55:22.938 --> 00:55:26.358
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

653
00:55:26.441 --> 00:55:27.734
It's too dangerous.

654
00:55:27.817 --> 00:55:30.320
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

655
00:55:30.403 --> 00:55:32.280
Who knows how many people
it touches.

656
00:55:32.364 --> 00:55:36.701
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

657
00:55:36.785 --> 00:55:38.787
It could tear
the whole city apart.

658
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.122
Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

659
00:55:42.624 --> 00:55:45.085
And Riddler's the match.

660
00:55:45.168 --> 00:55:46.687
You know Carmine Falcone.

661
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:48.505
I told you
it's a mob spot.

662
00:55:48.588 --> 00:55:50.233
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

663
00:55:50.257 --> 00:55:51.132
I don't have
a relationship...

664
00:55:52.968 --> 00:55:54.695
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

665
00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:55.863
I don't have
a relationship with him.

666
00:55:55.887 --> 00:55:57.097
Okay?

667
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.598
You know
Carmine Falcone.

668
00:55:58.682 --> 00:56:00.475
I told you
it's a mob spot.

669
00:56:00.558 --> 00:56:02.453
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

670
00:56:02.477 --> 00:56:03.871
I don't have a relationship with him.
 Okay?

671
00:56:03.895 --> 00:56:05.375
Pretty.

672
00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:08.066
She a new friend of yours?

673
00:56:11.945 --> 00:56:13.863
I'm not so sure.

674
00:56:13.947 --> 00:56:16.491
Looks like you upset her.

675
00:56:16.574 --> 00:56:18.868
Shall I take this
as a good sign?

676
00:56:18.952 --> 00:56:20.829
- What?
- Your attire.

677
00:56:20.912 --> 00:56:22.914
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

678
00:56:22.998 --> 00:56:24.958
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

679
00:56:25.041 --> 00:56:28.795
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

680
00:56:28.878 --> 00:56:30.505
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

681
00:56:30.588 --> 00:56:33.008
Oh, that reminds me.

682
00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:35.802
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

683
00:56:35.885 --> 00:56:37.637
on this latest cipher.

684
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:39.472
The one from the rat maze.

685
00:56:39.556 --> 00:56:42.851
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

686
00:56:42.934 --> 00:56:44.894
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

687
00:56:44.978 --> 00:56:48.773
"You are El Rata Alada."

688
00:56:48.857 --> 00:56:50.442
Rata Alada?

689
00:56:50.525 --> 00:56:51.568
"Rat with wings"?

690
00:56:51.651 --> 00:56:52.777
It's slang for "pigeon."

691
00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:54.362
Does that mean anything to you?

692
00:56:54.446 --> 00:56:55.572
Yeah.

693
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:58.366
A stool pigeon.

694
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.077
- Where are your cufflinks?
- I couldn't find them.

695
00:57:02.412 --> 00:57:04.331
Well, you can't
go out like that.

696
00:57:04.414 --> 00:57:06.374
Alfred, I don't want
your cufflinks.

697
00:57:10.378 --> 00:57:12.380
You have to keep up appearances.

698
00:57:12.464 --> 00:57:14.799
You're still a Wayne.

699
00:57:14.883 --> 00:57:17.260
And what about you?
Are you a Wayne?

700
00:57:18.178 --> 00:57:20.055
Your father gave them to me.

701
00:57:25.602 --> 00:57:29.647
No more lies! No more lies!

702
00:57:29.731 --> 00:57:37.731
No more lies! No more lies!

703
00:57:46.998 --> 00:57:48.333
Mr. Wayne. All right.

704
00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:50.710
All right, you're going
straight down there.

705
00:58:02.472 --> 00:58:04.140
Is that Bruce Wayne?

706
00:58:04.224 --> 00:58:06.810
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

707
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:17.112
Hold it.

708
00:58:18.405 --> 00:58:19.697
You good, fellas?

709
00:58:20.281 --> 00:58:21.282
Good.

710
00:58:23.368 --> 00:58:24.494
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

711
00:58:42.303 --> 00:58:43.304
Sir?

712
00:59:02.782 --> 00:59:03.992
Hey!

713
00:59:04.075 --> 00:59:05.994
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

714
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.997
Hey, watch it, fellas.

715
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.541
You got the prince
of the city there.

716
00:59:14.627 --> 00:59:16.337
Some event, huh?

717
00:59:16.421 --> 00:59:18.214
Brought out the one guy
in the city

718
00:59:18.298 --> 00:59:19.507
more reclusive than me.

719
00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:21.968
Thought you'd never leave
the Shoreline.

720
00:59:22.051 --> 00:59:23.696
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

721
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.889
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

722
00:59:26.723 --> 00:59:28.641
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

723
00:59:28.725 --> 00:59:30.351
Wow, is that right?

724
00:59:30.435 --> 00:59:33.104
His father saved my life.

725
00:59:33.188 --> 00:59:36.524
I got shot in the chest.
Right here.

726
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:38.943
I couldn't go to no hospital,

727
00:59:39.027 --> 00:59:41.279
so we showed up on his doorstep.

728
00:59:41.362 --> 00:59:44.574
Operated right
on the dining room table.

729
00:59:44.657 --> 00:59:47.869
Kid here,
he saw the whole thing,

730
00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:50.079
up on the stairs looking down.

731
00:59:51.456 --> 00:59:53.500
I remember your face.

732
00:59:55.293 --> 00:59:57.587
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

733
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:59.964
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

734
01:00:01.216 --> 01:00:02.884
"Hippocratic oath."

735
01:00:05.386 --> 01:00:07.055
That's good.

736
01:00:07.138 --> 01:00:08.348
Excuse me.

737
01:00:11.893 --> 01:00:12.810
Yes.

738
01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:28.409
Ladies and gentlemen,

739
01:00:28.493 --> 01:00:30.054
thank you all for coming
to today's memorial

740
01:00:30.078 --> 01:00:31.913
for our beloved mayor,
Don Mitchell, Jr.

741
01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:33.873
Our program will begin shortly.

742
01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:35.583
As a reminder, the family asked

743
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.144
that those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

744
01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:38.753
consider a donation to the cause

745
01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:40.630
most dear to his heart...

746
01:00:40.713 --> 01:00:42.799
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

747
01:00:42.882 --> 01:00:44.342
our city's safety net.

748
01:00:44.425 --> 01:00:47.971
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

749
01:00:48.054 --> 01:00:50.598
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it,

750
01:00:50.682 --> 01:00:51.975
I can tell you that.

751
01:00:52.058 --> 01:00:55.311
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

752
01:00:56.229 --> 01:00:58.189
He got what he deserved.

753
01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:01.067
Know what I mean?

754
01:01:02.277 --> 01:01:04.445
Hey, don't I know you?

755
01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:06.322
Bruce Wayne.

756
01:01:06.406 --> 01:01:08.491
Why haven't you called me back?

757
01:01:08.575 --> 01:01:09.784
I'm sorry?

758
01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.161
I'm Bella Real.
I'm running for mayor.

759
01:01:12.245 --> 01:01:13.788
I wouldn't be bothering
you here,

760
01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:16.207
but your people keep
telling me you're unavailable.

761
01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:17.709
Will you walk with me?

762
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.883
Mr. Wayne.

763
01:01:25.967 --> 01:01:29.637
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

764
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:31.389
Your family
has a history of philanthropy,

765
01:01:31.472 --> 01:01:34.058
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

766
01:01:34.142 --> 01:01:37.228
If I'm elected,
I want to change that.

767
01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:38.646
Thank you.

768
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.523
My God.

769
01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:44.736
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

770
01:01:44.819 --> 01:01:46.446
I want to continue this.

771
01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:51.618
Excuse me.

772
01:01:53.578 --> 01:01:55.538
I'm so sorry for your loss.

773
01:01:57.624 --> 01:01:58.916
Thank you.

774
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.760
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

775
01:02:01.753 --> 01:02:03.671
Gil Colson is missing.

776
01:02:03.755 --> 01:02:04.922
What?

777
01:02:05.006 --> 01:02:07.383
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

778
01:02:07.467 --> 01:02:08.509
Christ, not again.

779
01:02:08.593 --> 01:02:10.762
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

780
01:02:12.889 --> 01:02:15.475
You got people
looking for him, Jim?

781
01:02:15.558 --> 01:02:17.852
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

782
01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:19.187
What'd his wife say?

783
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.630
She hadn't
heard from him.

784
01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.661
Get out of the car!

785
01:03:16.744 --> 01:03:19.122
Get out of the car
and show your hands!

786
01:03:20.707 --> 01:03:21.874
Get out!

787
01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:33.261
Get 'em up!

788
01:03:33.344 --> 01:03:35.179
Get out! Show 'em!

789
01:03:39.559 --> 01:03:41.102
Christ, it's Colson.

790
01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:42.785
There's a bomb
around his neck!

791
01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.704
Let's clear this place out now!

792
01:03:59.787 --> 01:04:01.473
We've got to get
this place cleared out!

793
01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.326
Hey, guys, guys.
Here we go.

794
01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:43.039
We don't know
if he's in on it.

795
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.376
What's he looking at?

796
01:05:06.187 --> 01:05:08.397
Holy shit.

797
01:05:08.481 --> 01:05:10.107
Are you kidding me?

798
01:05:10.191 --> 01:05:13.694
What the hell is he doing?
Gordon!

799
01:05:13.778 --> 01:05:16.405
Your guy's gonna get himself
killed in there.

800
01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:33.297
Please.

801
01:05:33.381 --> 01:05:36.551
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

802
01:05:36.634 --> 01:05:37.844
He told me if I didn't do

803
01:05:37.927 --> 01:05:38.946
exactly what he said,
he'd kill me.

804
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:40.263
I'm so sorry.

805
01:05:40.346 --> 01:05:42.056
Looks like a combination lock.

806
01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:44.183
Can't we just cut it off?

807
01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:46.102
Not if you want
to keep your head.

808
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.015
You came.

809
01:06:25.808 --> 01:06:27.393
Who are you?

810
01:06:27.476 --> 01:06:28.477
Me?

811
01:06:30.855 --> 01:06:32.481
I'm nobody.

812
01:06:33.858 --> 01:06:36.277
I'm just an instrument,

813
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.070
here to unmask the truth

814
01:06:38.154 --> 01:06:40.740
about this cesspool
we call a city.

815
01:06:41.282 --> 01:06:42.325
"Unmask"?

816
01:06:42.408 --> 01:06:44.243
Yes.

817
01:06:44.327 --> 01:06:47.204
Let's do it together, okay?

818
01:06:47.288 --> 01:06:50.291
I've been trying to reach you.

819
01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:52.835
You're part of this, too.

820
01:06:52.919 --> 01:06:54.754
How am I a part of this?

821
01:06:54.837 --> 01:06:56.464
You'll see.

822
01:06:56.547 --> 01:06:58.358
Hey, Chief. You
better take a look at this.

823
01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:00.635
Say hello to my followers.

824
01:07:00.718 --> 01:07:02.094
We're live.

825
01:07:02.178 --> 01:07:04.889
They're here to watch
our little trial.

826
01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.350
At the moment,

827
01:07:07.433 --> 01:07:10.895
the man across
from you, Mr. Colson,

828
01:07:10.978 --> 01:07:12.146
is dead.

829
01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.856
Jesus, can we
get somebody out here?

830
01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.250
- This psycho's gonna kill me!
- But wait a minute...

831
01:07:15.274 --> 01:07:16.651
Shut up!

832
01:07:16.734 --> 01:07:18.374
You deserve to be dead
after what you did!

833
01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:21.405
You hear me?

834
01:07:21.489 --> 01:07:23.115
Okay.

835
01:07:31.123 --> 01:07:33.376
I'm giving you a chance.

836
01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:37.296
No one ever gave me a chance.

837
01:07:39.298 --> 01:07:41.175
Now,

838
01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.970
ever since I was a child,

839
01:07:44.053 --> 01:07:48.182
I've always loved
little puzzles.

840
01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.685
For me, they are a retreat

841
01:07:50.768 --> 01:07:54.146
from the horrors of our world.

842
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.399
Maybe they can bring

843
01:07:56.482 --> 01:07:59.318
some comfort to you too,
Mr. Colson.

844
01:07:59.402 --> 01:08:01.737
You want me to do puzzles?

845
01:08:01.821 --> 01:08:04.573
Three riddles in two minutes.

846
01:08:04.657 --> 01:08:06.283
You give me the answers,

847
01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:08.703
and I'll give you
the code for the lock.

848
01:08:08.786 --> 01:08:11.205
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

849
01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.374
Okay, okay. So I just...

850
01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.001
You want me to...

851
01:08:15.084 --> 01:08:16.919
Riddle number one...

852
01:08:17.002 --> 01:08:18.754
"It can be cruel,

853
01:08:18.837 --> 01:08:20.630
poetic, or blind,

854
01:08:20.715 --> 01:08:25.469
"but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

855
01:08:25.553 --> 01:08:28.054
Wait, wait, wait!
Can you repeat that?

856
01:08:28.139 --> 01:08:29.180
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

857
01:08:29.264 --> 01:08:30.683
- "Justice."
- Huh?

858
01:08:30.765 --> 01:08:31.850
The answer's "justice."

859
01:08:31.934 --> 01:08:33.227
- Justice?
- Yes!

860
01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.687
- Oh, God.
- Justice!

861
01:08:34.769 --> 01:08:37.398
And you were supposed to be

862
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:39.149
an arm of justice in this city,

863
01:08:39.233 --> 01:08:41.736
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

864
01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:44.112
were you not, Mr. Colson?

865
01:08:44.196 --> 01:08:45.531
Of course, of course.

866
01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:47.742
- Of course.
- Riddle number two.

867
01:08:47.825 --> 01:08:51.953
"If you are justice,
please do not lie."

868
01:08:52.037 --> 01:08:56.250
"What is the price
for your blind eye?"

869
01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:58.251
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

870
01:08:58.335 --> 01:08:59.502
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

871
01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:00.770
He's asking you how much it cost

872
01:09:00.795 --> 01:09:01.839
for you to turn your back.

873
01:09:03.131 --> 01:09:04.340
Fifty-eight seconds!

874
01:09:04.425 --> 01:09:05.885
- How much?
- Nothing!

875
01:09:05.968 --> 01:09:08.071
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

876
01:09:08.095 --> 01:09:09.304
I get a monthly payment

877
01:09:09.388 --> 01:09:10.740
just not to prosecute
certain cases.

878
01:09:10.764 --> 01:09:12.158
- What cases?
- He didn't ask me that!

879
01:09:12.183 --> 01:09:13.823
Come on! Ten grand.

880
01:09:13.893 --> 01:09:15.352
That's my answer.
It's ten grand!

881
01:09:15.435 --> 01:09:16.812
Okay. Okay. Okay.

882
01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:19.482
Don't lose your head,
Mr. Colson.

883
01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:23.568
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

884
01:09:23.652 --> 01:09:25.946
Last riddle.

885
01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:30.283
"Since
your justice is so select,

886
01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:34.788
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

887
01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.999
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

888
01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:38.250
The informant you all protect

889
01:09:38.334 --> 01:09:39.667
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

890
01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:41.562
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

891
01:09:41.586 --> 01:09:43.296
- Twenty seconds.
- No.

892
01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.233
- He's gonna kill you.
- I'm a dead man either way.

893
01:09:45.256 --> 01:09:46.609
You're talking
to a dead man, okay?

894
01:09:46.634 --> 01:09:48.301
If I go out this way,
it's just me.

895
01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:51.471
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

896
01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.913
- He'll kill them, too.
- Who will?

897
01:09:52.973 --> 01:09:54.475
- People are watching.
- What people?

898
01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:56.519
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

899
01:09:56.602 --> 01:09:57.770
It's the whole system!

900
01:09:57.853 --> 01:09:59.730
Five! Four!

901
01:09:59.814 --> 01:10:01.291
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!

902
01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:03.234
Goodbye!

903
01:10:33.764 --> 01:10:35.283
Who do you
think he is under there?

904
01:10:35.307 --> 01:10:37.187
- Take it easy.
- I want to see.

905
01:10:38.102 --> 01:10:39.502
What is that thing?
Leather?

906
01:10:43.065 --> 01:10:44.525
What's he got
on his eyes?

907
01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.211
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

908
01:10:46.235 --> 01:10:47.629
- We are we doing here?
- Let's just take it off...

909
01:10:47.653 --> 01:10:49.155
Hey!

910
01:10:49.238 --> 01:10:51.323
Hey! Hey! Hey!

911
01:10:51.407 --> 01:10:52.407
Hey! Hey!

912
01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.034
Relax, God damn it!

913
01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:55.744
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

914
01:10:57.288 --> 01:10:59.999
He interfered in an active
hostage situation.

915
01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:02.543
Colson's blood is on his hands.

916
01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:04.003
Maybe it's on yours.

917
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:06.421
What'd you say?

918
01:11:06.464 --> 01:11:08.591
He would rather die than talk.

919
01:11:08.674 --> 01:11:10.259
What was he afraid of?

920
01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:12.303
You?

921
01:11:19.143 --> 01:11:20.895
You son of a bitch.

922
01:11:20.978 --> 01:11:24.023
You have any idea what kind
of trouble you're in?

923
01:11:24.106 --> 01:11:25.733
You could be
an accessory to murder.

924
01:11:25.816 --> 01:11:27.002
Why are we
playing games...

925
01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:30.130
Get him! Come on!

926
01:11:30.154 --> 01:11:31.947
Back off! Back off!

927
01:11:32.031 --> 01:11:34.408
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

928
01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:35.731
You got me on assaulting three.

929
01:11:35.784 --> 01:11:37.286
Hey!

930
01:11:37.369 --> 01:11:39.650
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

931
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.584
You too now?

932
01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:46.253
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

933
01:11:46.337 --> 01:11:47.838
You're gonna put yourself
on the line

934
01:11:47.922 --> 01:11:49.340
for this scumbag, Jim?

935
01:11:49.423 --> 01:11:51.425
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

936
01:11:54.178 --> 01:11:55.679
Okay, give him the room.

937
01:12:11.278 --> 01:12:12.613
Two minutes.

938
01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:25.960
You listen to me.

939
01:12:27.378 --> 01:12:29.546
We gotta get you out of here.

940
01:12:31.006 --> 01:12:33.008
That would put
a lot of heat on you.

941
01:12:33.092 --> 01:12:34.927
Well, you punched me
in the face.

942
01:12:37.096 --> 01:12:38.430
Take this key.

943
01:12:39.682 --> 01:12:40.975
Through that door.

944
01:12:41.058 --> 01:12:43.852
Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

945
01:12:43.936 --> 01:12:46.647
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

946
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:49.024
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

947
01:12:52.361 --> 01:12:54.905
Who's the mustache
with the broken nose?

948
01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:00.828
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

949
01:13:00.911 --> 01:13:02.663
He's one of the guys
I got into it with

950
01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:04.039
at the Iceberg Lounge.

951
01:13:04.832 --> 01:13:05.833
What are you saying?

952
01:13:05.916 --> 01:13:07.584
Kenzie moonlights
for the Penguin?

953
01:13:10.212 --> 01:13:12.256
Or he moonlights as a cop.

954
01:13:16.677 --> 01:13:18.237
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

955
01:13:18.262 --> 01:13:19.763
Somebody stop him!

956
01:13:57.885 --> 01:13:59.765
- There he is!
- Freeze!

957
01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.851
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

958
01:14:48.394 --> 01:14:49.478
I did.

959
01:14:49.561 --> 01:14:51.271
Bock put out an APB on you.

960
01:14:51.355 --> 01:14:52.940
You really think
he's in on this?

961
01:14:53.023 --> 01:14:55.150
I don't trust any of 'em.
Do you?

962
01:14:55.234 --> 01:14:56.777
I only trust you.

963
01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.713
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

964
01:14:58.737 --> 01:15:00.948
Colson said,
"Cops protect the rat."

965
01:15:01.031 --> 01:15:02.783
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

966
01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:04.159
You think Penguin's the rat?

967
01:15:04.243 --> 01:15:05.661
His club caters to the mob.

968
01:15:05.744 --> 01:15:07.204
Maroni practically lived there.

969
01:15:07.287 --> 01:15:09.248
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

970
01:15:09.331 --> 01:15:10.582
DA was a regular, too.

971
01:15:10.666 --> 01:15:12.418
Maybe Penguin
got himself into a jam

972
01:15:12.501 --> 01:15:15.212
and working a deal
was his only way out.

973
01:15:15.295 --> 01:15:17.714
- The Rata Alada.
- The what?

974
01:15:17.798 --> 01:15:19.216
Riddler's latest.

975
01:15:19.299 --> 01:15:20.801
The cipher in the maze.

976
01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:23.554
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

977
01:15:25.055 --> 01:15:26.765
A penguin's got wings, too.

978
01:15:28.559 --> 01:15:30.519
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

979
01:15:30.602 --> 01:15:32.402
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

980
01:15:32.479 --> 01:15:33.647
It's all connected.

981
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.649
Like it or not,
it's his game now.

982
01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:38.944
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

983
01:15:41.363 --> 01:15:42.590
Kenzie and the twins,

984
01:15:42.614 --> 01:15:43.782
coming your way.

985
01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:45.826
There's Penguin.

986
01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:47.703
I wonder
what's in the bags.

987
01:15:49.246 --> 01:15:50.581
You want to move in?

988
01:15:52.374 --> 01:15:53.792
Let's follow.

989
01:16:12.269 --> 01:16:13.937
They stopped
at Waterfront Street.

990
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:15.898
The recycling plant.

991
01:16:15.981 --> 01:16:18.400
I'm here.

992
01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:20.378
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

993
01:16:20.402 --> 01:16:21.528
Good, good.

994
01:16:21.612 --> 01:16:24.031
Let's get in out of this deluge.

995
01:16:42.132 --> 01:16:44.718
It's a drug lab. Drops.

996
01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:46.011
This is a buy.

997
01:16:46.094 --> 01:16:47.596
Looks like
they got Maroni's operation

998
01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:49.097
up and running again.

999
01:16:49.181 --> 01:16:50.325
Or they never
shut it down at all.

1000
01:16:50.349 --> 01:16:51.892
What are you saying?

1001
01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:55.145
The biggest drug bust
in GCPD history was a fraud?

1002
01:17:19.503 --> 01:17:21.421
This just got complicated.

1003
01:17:21.505 --> 01:17:22.714
What do you mean?

1004
01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.347
Hey! What happened?

1005
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:31.682
You all right?

1006
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.944
Dangerous crowd
you're stealing from.

1007
01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:46.446
Jesus.

1008
01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:48.782
Is this how
you get your kicks, hon?

1009
01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:50.200
Sneaking up on girls
in the dark?

1010
01:17:50.284 --> 01:17:52.786
Is that why
you work in the club?

1011
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.121
It was all just a score?

1012
01:17:54.204 --> 01:17:55.804
You know, I would love
to sit and go over

1013
01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:57.791
every gory detail
with you, bat boy,

1014
01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.961
but, uh, those assholes
are coming back.

1015
01:18:12.264 --> 01:18:14.266
Jesus!

1016
01:18:41.919 --> 01:18:43.086
Hey, Vengeance!

1017
01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:47.966
You think you can come
after my money, huh?

1018
01:19:28.715 --> 01:19:30.342
Kenzie! Get the money!

1019
01:19:35.806 --> 01:19:37.057
Hey! What the...

1020
01:20:27.441 --> 01:20:28.734
Whoa!

1021
01:20:32.154 --> 01:20:33.780
Come on! Come on!

1022
01:20:36.867 --> 01:20:38.952
This guy's crazy!

1023
01:20:39.995 --> 01:20:41.747
Come on! Hey!

1024
01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:32.172
Move!

1025
01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.780
Get out of the way!

1026
01:22:49.916 --> 01:22:51.001
Come on!

1027
01:22:59.676 --> 01:23:00.844
Get out of the way!

1028
01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:40.091
I got you!

1029
01:23:41.301 --> 01:23:42.594
I got you!

1030
01:23:42.677 --> 01:23:45.013
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

1031
01:23:45.096 --> 01:23:46.598
I got you!

1032
01:25:03.174 --> 01:25:06.136
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

1033
01:25:06.219 --> 01:25:08.847
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

1034
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:10.366
Let's make it
easy for you, Oz.

1035
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:11.766
Cops caught you doing something.

1036
01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:13.494
They were gonna
shut you down, put you away.

1037
01:25:13.518 --> 01:25:15.395
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

1038
01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:17.605
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

1039
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:18.982
His drops operation.

1040
01:25:19.065 --> 01:25:20.459
But the cops,
the city officials,

1041
01:25:20.483 --> 01:25:21.483
the mayor, the DA,

1042
01:25:21.526 --> 01:25:22.736
they got greedy, right?

1043
01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:25.030
Wasn't enough,
a big career-making bust.

1044
01:25:25.113 --> 01:25:26.924
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

1045
01:25:26.948 --> 01:25:29.325
but they needed a minor league
mope like you to run it.

1046
01:25:29.409 --> 01:25:31.661
You don't just work
for Carmine Falcone.

1047
01:25:31.745 --> 01:25:32.829
You work for them, too.

1048
01:25:32.912 --> 01:25:34.080
What are you, crazy?

1049
01:25:34.164 --> 01:25:35.182
That why
you killed the girl?

1050
01:25:35.206 --> 01:25:36.416
I didn't kill no girl!

1051
01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:38.144
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

1052
01:25:38.168 --> 01:25:39.377
But she got too close, right?

1053
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:40.754
Found out from Mitchell

1054
01:25:40.837 --> 01:25:42.189
that you were the rat,
so you killed her.

1055
01:25:42.213 --> 01:25:43.590
But somehow
Riddler found out, too.

1056
01:25:43.673 --> 01:25:45.633
He knows so much about you.

1057
01:25:45.717 --> 01:25:48.261
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

1058
01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:50.930
Boy, you guys are a hell
of a duet here.

1059
01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:52.599
Why don't you start harmonizing?

1060
01:25:52.682 --> 01:25:55.268
There's only one problem with
your little scenario, okay?

1061
01:25:55.352 --> 01:25:56.770
I ain't no rat!

1062
01:25:56.853 --> 01:25:58.664
You got any idea what
Carmine Falcone would do to me

1063
01:25:58.688 --> 01:25:59.888
if he heard this kind of talk?

1064
01:25:59.939 --> 01:26:01.900
Oh, you don't wanna talk
about rats, huh?

1065
01:26:01.983 --> 01:26:03.193
Maybe we can talk about

1066
01:26:03.276 --> 01:26:04.587
what they did
to my partner's face.

1067
01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:06.131
Holy God, what are you
showing me here?

1068
01:26:06.196 --> 01:26:07.947
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

1069
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:10.033
Open your eyes!

1070
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:15.622
Are you El Rata Alada?

1071
01:26:15.705 --> 01:26:16.956
El Rata Alada?

1072
01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.350
Yeah,
a "rat with wings."

1073
01:26:18.374 --> 01:26:19.793
A stool pigeon.
That's not you?

1074
01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:21.336
The symbols in the maze,
right here.

1075
01:26:21.419 --> 01:26:24.047
It says you are El Rata Alada.

1076
01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:25.423
"You are El Rata"?
It says that?

1077
01:26:25.507 --> 01:26:26.841
Why, you got something
to tell us?

1078
01:26:26.925 --> 01:26:28.176
Yeah!

1079
01:26:28.259 --> 01:26:29.862
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

1080
01:26:29.886 --> 01:26:32.138
- What?
- It's "La."

1081
01:26:32.222 --> 01:26:33.807
"La" rata.

1082
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:35.975
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

1083
01:26:36.059 --> 01:26:38.269
Jesus! Look at you two.

1084
01:26:38.353 --> 01:26:40.855
World's greatest detectives!

1085
01:26:40.939 --> 01:26:42.291
Am I the only here
knows the difference

1086
01:26:42.315 --> 01:26:43.650
between "el" and "la"?

1087
01:26:43.733 --> 01:26:46.027
Jesus!
No habla espanol, fellas?

1088
01:26:46.111 --> 01:26:48.238
Do me a favor, shithead,
shut up!

1089
01:26:49.572 --> 01:26:50.782
You think he made a mistake?

1090
01:26:50.865 --> 01:26:51.950
He doesn't made mistakes.

1091
01:26:52.033 --> 01:26:53.284
A rat with wings?

1092
01:26:53.368 --> 01:26:54.828
You know what
that sounds like to me?

1093
01:26:54.911 --> 01:26:57.997
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1094
01:26:58.081 --> 01:27:00.166
"You are El Rata."

1095
01:27:05.755 --> 01:27:07.382
"You"...

1096
01:27:07.465 --> 01:27:08.508
"are"...

1097
01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:09.634
"El."

1098
01:27:18.059 --> 01:27:20.603
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1099
01:27:20.687 --> 01:27:21.896
Wait.

1100
01:27:25.358 --> 01:27:27.443
Is that him?

1101
01:27:27.527 --> 01:27:29.821
Holy shit.

1102
01:27:49.090 --> 01:27:50.970
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1103
01:28:20.079 --> 01:28:23.750
"I grew up from a seed,
tough as a weed...

1104
01:28:23.833 --> 01:28:26.628
But in a mansion, in a slum...

1105
01:28:26.711 --> 01:28:29.505
I'll never know
where I come from.

1106
01:28:29.589 --> 01:28:31.007
Do you know what I am?"

1107
01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:32.091
Any idea?

1108
01:28:32.634 --> 01:28:33.635
Yeah.

1109
01:28:35.011 --> 01:28:36.304
It's an orphan.

1110
01:28:45.146 --> 01:28:46.940
A mansion in a slum.

1111
01:28:48.399 --> 01:28:49.859
He's talking about
the old orphanage.

1112
01:28:49.943 --> 01:28:51.069
The one that burned down?

1113
01:28:51.152 --> 01:28:53.488
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1114
01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:55.782
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1115
01:28:55.865 --> 01:28:56.950
Let's go.

1116
01:28:59.077 --> 01:29:01.704
You guys realize
I'm still here, right?

1117
01:29:02.747 --> 01:29:04.123
You gonna untie me?

1118
01:29:04.207 --> 01:29:06.007
How the hell am I supposed
to get out of here?

1119
01:29:09.545 --> 01:29:10.546
Hey!

1120
01:29:11.881 --> 01:29:14.467
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1121
01:29:28.314 --> 01:29:30.692
No guns.

1122
01:29:31.985 --> 01:29:34.195
Yeah, man.
That's your thing.

1123
01:29:55.258 --> 01:29:56.467
What's that?

1124
01:30:07.103 --> 01:30:09.063
Hey! Hey!

1125
01:30:15.486 --> 01:30:17.322
Dropheads.

1126
01:30:24.078 --> 01:30:25.788
What the hell is that?

1127
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.927
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1128
01:30:40.011 --> 01:30:41.262
Wasn't that beautiful?

1129
01:30:43.848 --> 01:30:46.267
Thank you all.
Thank you, uh...

1130
01:30:46.351 --> 01:30:48.061
Thank you for coming today.

1131
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:51.397
I believe in Gotham.

1132
01:30:52.565 --> 01:30:55.401
I believe in its promise.

1133
01:30:55.485 --> 01:30:59.572
But too many have been
left behind for too long,

1134
01:30:59.655 --> 01:31:01.282
and that's why I'm here today.

1135
01:31:01.366 --> 01:31:04.160
To announce, not only
my candidacy for mayor,

1136
01:31:04.243 --> 01:31:08.247
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

1137
01:31:08.331 --> 01:31:09.999
Win or lose,

1138
01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:13.211
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a one billion dollar donation

1139
01:31:13.294 --> 01:31:16.631
to start a charitable
endowment for public works.

1140
01:31:16.714 --> 01:31:18.424
I want to bypass
political gridlock,

1141
01:31:18.508 --> 01:31:20.760
and get money
to people and projects

1142
01:31:20.843 --> 01:31:22.929
who need it now,

1143
01:31:23.012 --> 01:31:24.555
like these children behind me.

1144
01:31:24.639 --> 01:31:26.224
"Sins of the father."

1145
01:31:26.307 --> 01:31:30.061
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds

1146
01:31:30.144 --> 01:31:33.106
and renewing Gotham's promise.

1147
01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:39.278
Shall be visited upon the son.

1148
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:44.367
Jesus. His next victim
is Bruce Wayne.

1149
01:31:48.955 --> 01:31:50.289
Hey!

1150
01:32:49.891 --> 01:32:51.184
- Hello?
- Dory!

1151
01:32:51.267 --> 01:32:52.477
I need to speak to Alfred!

1152
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.437
- Oh, Mr. Wayne...
- Listen to me!

1153
01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.856
Something terrible
is gonna happen!

1154
01:32:56.939 --> 01:33:00.193
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1155
01:33:10.536 --> 01:33:12.455
About an hour ago.

1156
01:33:13.581 --> 01:33:15.291
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:18.669
I've been trying to reach you.

1158
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:23.424
The package
was intended for you.

1159
01:33:23.508 --> 01:33:25.885
It was a C-4 explosive
sent in a mailer.

1160
01:33:25.968 --> 01:33:27.428
We found this too.

1161
01:33:50.034 --> 01:33:51.577
We've sedated him.

1162
01:33:51.661 --> 01:33:54.038
We just have to hope
he stabilizes.

1163
01:33:54.121 --> 01:33:57.333
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1164
01:33:57.416 --> 01:33:59.293
Is there anyone else to notify?

1165
01:34:00.586 --> 01:34:01.963
Next of kin?

1166
01:34:07.176 --> 01:34:08.261
No.

1167
01:34:09.345 --> 01:34:10.888
It's just me.

1168
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:55.284
Selina?

1169
01:36:01.874 --> 01:36:02.875
Can you see me?

1170
01:36:06.003 --> 01:36:08.631
- Yeah, I can see you.
- I need to talk to you.

1171
01:36:09.465 --> 01:36:10.633
Where can we go?

1172
01:36:28.901 --> 01:36:30.986
Cat burglar
pulling another score?

1173
01:36:31.904 --> 01:36:32.905
What?

1174
01:36:32.988 --> 01:36:34.281
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1175
01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:35.550
Yeah, well, things were getting

1176
01:36:35.574 --> 01:36:37.743
a little hot for me, so...

1177
01:36:37.827 --> 01:36:39.495
How could they do that to her?

1178
01:36:39.578 --> 01:36:41.622
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1179
01:36:41.706 --> 01:36:43.499
Her body was in his car.

1180
01:36:43.582 --> 01:36:45.710
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna make him pay.

1181
01:36:45.793 --> 01:36:47.503
- You gonna help me?
- Help you?

1182
01:36:47.586 --> 01:36:49.505
Yeah. I thought
you were "Vengeance."

1183
01:36:49.588 --> 01:36:51.316
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1184
01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:52.842
She didn't know any better.

1185
01:36:52.925 --> 01:36:54.361
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1186
01:36:54.385 --> 01:36:56.053
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1187
01:36:56.137 --> 01:36:57.656
It means your choices
have consequences.

1188
01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.015
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1189
01:37:00.099 --> 01:37:01.368
You know,
whoever the hell you are,

1190
01:37:01.392 --> 01:37:02.935
you obviously grew up rich.

1191
01:37:03.018 --> 01:37:04.937
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1192
01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.441
Compromising yourself for money?

1193
01:37:08.524 --> 01:37:12.278
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1194
01:37:12.361 --> 01:37:16.073
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1195
01:37:16.157 --> 01:37:17.676
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1196
01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.827
- Falcone owes me that money.
- He owes you?

1197
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:21.596
- Yeah, and a lot more.
- Oh, really? Why's that?

1198
01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.848
You know what?
I can't even talk to you.

1199
01:37:22.872 --> 01:37:24.248
No! I want to know

1200
01:37:24.331 --> 01:37:25.767
why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.

1201
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:28.169
Because he's my father!

1202
01:37:37.219 --> 01:37:40.097
My mother worked
at the 44 Below.

1203
01:37:41.557 --> 01:37:42.892
Just like Anni.

1204
01:37:44.852 --> 01:37:47.605
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1205
01:37:49.648 --> 01:37:51.025
To the club?

1206
01:37:51.942 --> 01:37:52.943
Yeah.

1207
01:37:55.446 --> 01:37:58.824
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1208
01:37:58.908 --> 01:38:01.327
Used to see him there.

1209
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:03.496
He scared the shit out of me.

1210
01:38:05.372 --> 01:38:06.582
And I could never understand

1211
01:38:06.665 --> 01:38:09.126
why he looked at me
the way he did.

1212
01:38:09.210 --> 01:38:13.172
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1213
01:38:16.425 --> 01:38:18.969
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1214
01:38:19.595 --> 01:38:21.388
Strangled.

1215
01:38:21.472 --> 01:38:22.723
Never found out who.

1216
01:38:22.807 --> 01:38:25.017
Probably some creep
from the club.

1217
01:38:26.685 --> 01:38:28.813
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1218
01:38:28.896 --> 01:38:31.232
and he didn't say a thing.

1219
01:38:32.983 --> 01:38:34.860
Couldn't even look at me.

1220
01:38:38.531 --> 01:38:40.366
He owes me that money.

1221
01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:43.577
I'm sorry.

1222
01:38:44.662 --> 01:38:45.871
For what I said.

1223
01:38:47.164 --> 01:38:48.666
Ah, it's all right.

1224
01:38:52.002 --> 01:38:54.255
You assume the worst in people.

1225
01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:56.549
Which, well...

1226
01:38:58.801 --> 01:39:00.928
maybe we're not
so different after all.

1227
01:39:06.142 --> 01:39:07.977
Who are you under there?

1228
01:39:13.983 --> 01:39:15.943
What are you hiding?

1229
01:39:18.279 --> 01:39:20.155
Are you just...

1230
01:39:21.657 --> 01:39:23.450
hideously scarred?

1231
01:39:25.578 --> 01:39:26.579
Yeah.

1232
01:39:33.752 --> 01:39:35.212
Listen to me.

1233
01:39:36.714 --> 01:39:40.551
If we don't stand up
for Annika, no one will.

1234
01:39:40.634 --> 01:39:42.761
All anyone cares about
in this place

1235
01:39:42.845 --> 01:39:45.931
are these white,
privileged assholes.

1236
01:39:46.015 --> 01:39:49.101
The mayor,
the commissioner, the DA.

1237
01:39:49.184 --> 01:39:50.436
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1238
01:39:50.519 --> 01:39:51.854
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1239
01:39:51.937 --> 01:39:53.856
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1240
01:39:53.939 --> 01:39:55.274
I think you'd be on his side.

1241
01:39:55.357 --> 01:39:57.002
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1242
01:39:57.026 --> 01:39:58.861
What, do you live in a cave?

1243
01:39:58.944 --> 01:40:02.031
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1244
01:40:02.114 --> 01:40:06.243
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1245
01:40:06.327 --> 01:40:07.494
will you help me?

1246
01:40:08.704 --> 01:40:10.039
Please.

1247
01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:14.710
Come on, Vengeance.

1248
01:40:16.962 --> 01:40:19.298
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

1249
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:21.109
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1250
01:40:30.976 --> 01:40:32.561
I told you, baby.

1251
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:36.899
I can take care of myself.

1252
01:40:47.493 --> 01:40:50.996
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

1253
01:40:58.796 --> 01:41:00.172
From a very young age,

1254
01:41:00.255 --> 01:41:02.383
my family, Martha's family,
the Arkhams,

1255
01:41:02.466 --> 01:41:04.176
instilled in both of us

1256
01:41:04.259 --> 01:41:07.096
that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1257
01:41:07.179 --> 01:41:09.181
it's a passion.

1258
01:41:09.264 --> 01:41:12.643
That is our family's legacy.

1259
01:41:12.726 --> 01:41:15.187
The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1260
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:17.690
Gotham's founding families.

1261
01:41:17.773 --> 01:41:22.069
But what is their real legacy?

1262
01:41:22.152 --> 01:41:25.114
Twenty years ago,
one reporter set out

1263
01:41:25.197 --> 01:41:26.865
to uncover the dark truth.

1264
01:41:26.949 --> 01:41:31.245
He found
shocking family secrets.

1265
01:41:31.328 --> 01:41:33.288
How, when Martha
was just a child,

1266
01:41:33.372 --> 01:41:35.541
her mother
brutally murdered her father,

1267
01:41:35.624 --> 01:41:37.084
then committed suicide...

1268
01:41:37.167 --> 01:41:38.711
...and how the Arkhams

1269
01:41:38.794 --> 01:41:42.923
used their power and money
to cover it up.

1270
01:41:43.007 --> 01:41:44.883
How Martha herself

1271
01:41:44.967 --> 01:41:47.720
was in and out of institutions
for years,

1272
01:41:47.803 --> 01:41:50.723
and they didn't want
anyone to know.

1273
01:41:50.806 --> 01:41:53.267
Thomas Wayne tried to force
this crusading reporter

1274
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:57.771
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1275
01:41:57.855 --> 01:42:00.065
But when
the reporter refused,

1276
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:02.901
Wayne turned
to longtime secret associate.

1277
01:42:02.985 --> 01:42:04.403
Carmine Falcone,

1278
01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:06.947
and had him murdered!

1279
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:10.701
The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1280
01:42:10.784 --> 01:42:16.415
Gotham's legacy
of lies and murder.

1281
01:42:16.498 --> 01:42:18.917
I hope
you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1282
01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:21.587
This is your legacy too.

1283
01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:25.049
And Gotham needs you to answer

1284
01:42:25.132 --> 01:42:28.135
for the sins of your father.

1285
01:42:29.678 --> 01:42:31.472
Goodbye.

1286
01:42:37.019 --> 01:42:38.145
Do you know who I am?

1287
01:42:39.688 --> 01:42:40.773
You're Bruce Wayne.

1288
01:42:40.856 --> 01:42:42.858
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1289
01:42:53.619 --> 01:42:54.620
See?

1290
01:43:06.256 --> 01:43:09.093
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1291
01:43:09.176 --> 01:43:11.553
Must have made a fortune.

1292
01:43:11.637 --> 01:43:14.807
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1293
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:17.476
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1294
01:43:17.559 --> 01:43:18.602
No, boss.

1295
01:43:18.685 --> 01:43:21.438
$1,183.

1296
01:43:21.522 --> 01:43:23.524
You know
why communism failed, right?

1297
01:43:23.607 --> 01:43:24.691
No, boss.

1298
01:43:26.568 --> 01:43:27.820
Austerity.

1299
01:43:29.988 --> 01:43:31.490
All right. All right.

1300
01:43:31.573 --> 01:43:34.201
Look at that. Perfect.

1301
01:43:34.284 --> 01:43:36.245
It's never gonna be
that good again.

1302
01:43:38.413 --> 01:43:40.874
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1303
01:43:40.958 --> 01:43:42.167
What are you doing here?

1304
01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:45.921
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1305
01:43:46.755 --> 01:43:47.881
Come on.

1306
01:43:49.758 --> 01:43:51.009
See ya, champ.

1307
01:43:51.927 --> 01:43:53.262
Come on, sweetheart.

1308
01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:56.223
Have a seat.

1309
01:43:58.142 --> 01:44:00.978
I thought I might hear from you.

1310
01:44:01.061 --> 01:44:04.356
This, uh, Riddler
son of a bitch is really

1311
01:44:05.816 --> 01:44:07.609
stirring things up, huh?

1312
01:44:07.693 --> 01:44:09.486
- Is it true?
- What?

1313
01:44:10.696 --> 01:44:12.406
That reporter business?

1314
01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.100
What do you want
to know here, kid?

1315
01:44:15.159 --> 01:44:17.828
Did you kill him?
For my father?

1316
01:44:17.911 --> 01:44:21.498
Look, your father
was in trouble.

1317
01:44:21.582 --> 01:44:23.417
This reporter had some dirt.

1318
01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.044
Some very

1319
01:44:26.128 --> 01:44:28.881
personal stuff
about your mother,

1320
01:44:28.964 --> 01:44:30.215
her family history.

1321
01:44:30.299 --> 01:44:31.860
You know, everybody's got
their dirty laundry,

1322
01:44:31.884 --> 01:44:33.177
that's just how it is.

1323
01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.404
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1324
01:44:34.428 --> 01:44:36.597
not right before the election.

1325
01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.891
And your father
tried to pay the guy off,

1326
01:44:38.974 --> 01:44:40.851
but he wasn't going for it.

1327
01:44:40.934 --> 01:44:42.519
So...

1328
01:44:42.603 --> 01:44:43.937
he came to me.

1329
01:44:44.021 --> 01:44:46.565
Well, I never seen him
like that.

1330
01:44:47.316 --> 01:44:49.735
He said, "Carmine",

1331
01:44:49.818 --> 01:44:54.740
"I want you to put
the fear of God in this guy."

1332
01:44:57.034 --> 01:45:00.078
And when fear isn't enough...

1333
01:45:00.787 --> 01:45:02.247
Oof. Hmm.

1334
01:45:03.707 --> 01:45:07.211
Your father wanted me
to handle it, so I did.

1335
01:45:08.170 --> 01:45:10.047
I handled it.

1336
01:45:11.715 --> 01:45:13.008
I know.

1337
01:45:13.091 --> 01:45:15.510
You thought your father
was a Boy Scout.

1338
01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:18.472
But you'd be surprised

1339
01:45:18.555 --> 01:45:20.891
what even a good man like him

1340
01:45:20.974 --> 01:45:23.727
is capable of
in the right situation.

1341
01:45:25.938 --> 01:45:27.606
Do me a favor.

1342
01:45:27.689 --> 01:45:29.816
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1343
01:45:30.525 --> 01:45:32.110
This reporter

1344
01:45:32.903 --> 01:45:34.446
was a lowlife.

1345
01:45:34.529 --> 01:45:36.073
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1346
01:45:37.616 --> 01:45:39.785
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1347
01:45:39.868 --> 01:45:43.956
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1348
01:45:44.039 --> 01:45:46.291
And... And after what happened
with that reporter,

1349
01:45:46.375 --> 01:45:48.043
Maroni was worried

1350
01:45:48.126 --> 01:45:50.629
that your father
would be in my pocket

1351
01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:52.839
forever.

1352
01:45:52.923 --> 01:45:54.967
He would have done anything

1353
01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:57.302
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1354
01:45:57.386 --> 01:45:58.762
You understand?

1355
01:45:59.930 --> 01:46:01.223
Are you saying

1356
01:46:01.306 --> 01:46:04.476
Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1357
01:46:04.559 --> 01:46:06.645
Do I know it for a fact?

1358
01:46:08.897 --> 01:46:11.149
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1359
01:46:12.401 --> 01:46:14.695
This is what you wanted, huh?

1360
01:46:14.778 --> 01:46:17.531
This little conversation here?

1361
01:46:19.616 --> 01:46:21.910
It's been
a long time coming, huh?

1362
01:46:24.413 --> 01:46:26.665
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1363
01:47:36.318 --> 01:47:37.652
You lied to me...

1364
01:47:40.447 --> 01:47:42.115
my whole life.

1365
01:47:47.162 --> 01:47:49.331
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1366
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.462
He told me what he did
for my father.

1367
01:47:59.508 --> 01:48:01.093
About Salvatore Maroni.

1368
01:48:02.844 --> 01:48:05.597
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1369
01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:07.516
Had my father killed.

1370
01:48:09.851 --> 01:48:12.187
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1371
01:48:14.731 --> 01:48:19.861
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1372
01:48:19.945 --> 01:48:22.280
believing that he was
a good man.

1373
01:48:22.364 --> 01:48:24.574
He was a good man.

1374
01:48:24.658 --> 01:48:26.284
You listen to me.

1375
01:48:26.368 --> 01:48:29.913
Your father was a good man.

1376
01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:35.627
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1377
01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:37.712
He had a man killed.

1378
01:48:37.796 --> 01:48:39.881
Why?

1379
01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:43.301
To protect his family image?

1380
01:48:44.302 --> 01:48:45.470
His political aspirations?

1381
01:48:45.554 --> 01:48:47.034
It wasn't to protect
the family image,

1382
01:48:47.097 --> 01:48:49.266
and he didn't have
anyone killed.

1383
01:48:51.726 --> 01:48:53.979
He was protecting your mother.

1384
01:48:54.062 --> 01:48:57.816
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1385
01:48:57.899 --> 01:49:00.110
He cared about her

1386
01:49:00.193 --> 01:49:01.570
and you,

1387
01:49:01.653 --> 01:49:04.239
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1388
01:49:04.322 --> 01:49:08.660
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1389
01:49:08.743 --> 01:49:10.370
Your father should have known

1390
01:49:10.454 --> 01:49:12.080
that Falcone would do anything

1391
01:49:12.164 --> 01:49:15.333
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1392
01:49:15.417 --> 01:49:17.252
That's who Falcone is.

1393
01:49:19.421 --> 01:49:21.756
And that was
your father's mistake.

1394
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.842
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1395
01:49:23.925 --> 01:49:27.345
your father was distraught.

1396
01:49:27.429 --> 01:49:30.682
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1397
01:49:30.765 --> 01:49:33.101
that he would confess
everything.

1398
01:49:34.561 --> 01:49:36.521
And that night,

1399
01:49:36.605 --> 01:49:39.357
your father and your mother

1400
01:49:39.441 --> 01:49:40.609
were killed.

1401
01:49:46.031 --> 01:49:47.782
It was Falcone?

1402
01:49:53.788 --> 01:49:55.957
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1403
01:50:00.504 --> 01:50:04.132
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1404
01:50:04.216 --> 01:50:05.675
who needed money, got scared,

1405
01:50:05.759 --> 01:50:07.052
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1406
01:50:07.135 --> 01:50:10.222
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1407
01:50:10.305 --> 01:50:12.390
searching for that answer...

1408
01:50:13.934 --> 01:50:18.480
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1409
01:50:18.563 --> 01:50:20.524
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1410
01:50:20.607 --> 01:50:23.109
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1411
01:50:25.153 --> 01:50:27.531
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1412
01:50:28.823 --> 01:50:31.243
but I didn't know how to help.

1413
01:50:31.326 --> 01:50:34.996
I could teach you
how to fight,

1414
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.916
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1415
01:50:37.999 --> 01:50:39.876
You needed a father.

1416
01:50:41.753 --> 01:50:44.256
And all you had was me.

1417
01:50:46.591 --> 01:50:47.842
I'm sorry.

1418
01:50:49.511 --> 01:50:51.513
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1419
01:50:58.311 --> 01:50:59.396
God.

1420
01:51:02.232 --> 01:51:06.778
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1421
01:51:09.364 --> 01:51:11.616
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1422
01:51:18.039 --> 01:51:19.332
I mean,

1423
01:51:20.458 --> 01:51:22.669
I'm not afraid to die.

1424
01:51:24.296 --> 01:51:26.798
I realize now there's something.

1425
01:51:27.882 --> 01:51:29.801
I haven't got past.

1426
01:51:30.677 --> 01:51:32.470
This fear...

1427
01:51:34.723 --> 01:51:37.892
of ever going through
any of that again.

1428
01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:44.316
Of losing somebody I care about.

1429
01:52:34.949 --> 01:52:35.992
Hey.

1430
01:52:36.076 --> 01:52:38.703
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1431
01:52:38.787 --> 01:52:40.664
I thought it was you.

1432
01:52:53.468 --> 01:52:55.053
- I found him!
- I see that.

1433
01:52:55.136 --> 01:52:56.638
He had my shit and my phone.

1434
01:52:56.721 --> 01:52:58.324
She left a message
the night they took her.

1435
01:52:58.348 --> 01:53:00.725
- She called me...
- Gordon! Help me out, man!

1436
01:53:00.809 --> 01:53:02.352
She got my gun!

1437
01:53:03.687 --> 01:53:06.481
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1438
01:53:06.564 --> 01:53:09.317
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1439
01:53:13.655 --> 01:53:15.949
Here. Listen.

1440
01:53:17.909 --> 01:53:19.744
Hey! Get back here!

1441
01:53:19.828 --> 01:53:21.138
Where you going?

1442
01:53:21.162 --> 01:53:22.664
Come back here!

1443
01:53:22.747 --> 01:53:24.058
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1444
01:53:24.082 --> 01:53:25.417
You're scaring her.

1445
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.085
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1446
01:53:27.168 --> 01:53:28.479
Please, please, please.

1447
01:53:28.503 --> 01:53:29.921
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1448
01:53:30.004 --> 01:53:32.674
Hey, don't be scared.
Come here.

1449
01:53:34.509 --> 01:53:37.095
Now let me ask you again.

1450
01:53:37.178 --> 01:53:39.764
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...

1451
01:53:39.848 --> 01:53:42.809
Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1452
01:53:42.892 --> 01:53:46.062
Especially to pretty girls
like you.

1453
01:53:46.146 --> 01:53:48.773
That's why I made him
take your passport,

1454
01:53:48.857 --> 01:53:51.693
until we could have
this little conversation.

1455
01:53:51.776 --> 01:53:54.487
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1456
01:53:54.571 --> 01:53:56.364
You'll never hear from me
again, nobody will.

1457
01:53:56.448 --> 01:53:58.032
Please, please...

1458
01:53:58.116 --> 01:54:00.785
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1459
01:54:00.869 --> 01:54:04.289
But first, I gotta know...

1460
01:54:04.372 --> 01:54:06.416
- What did he tell you?
- He...

1461
01:54:06.499 --> 01:54:10.545
He just said they all made
a deal with you.

1462
01:54:10.628 --> 01:54:13.965
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?

1463
01:54:14.048 --> 01:54:15.300
The deal.

1464
01:54:15.383 --> 01:54:16.885
He said

1465
01:54:16.968 --> 01:54:20.221
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1466
01:54:20.305 --> 01:54:22.974
and that's how he became mayor.

1467
01:54:23.057 --> 01:54:25.602
He said you were
a very important man.

1468
01:54:25.685 --> 01:54:26.853
Right.

1469
01:54:27.562 --> 01:54:28.897
Mm-hmm.

1470
01:54:29.814 --> 01:54:32.108
Hmm. Okay.

1471
01:54:39.532 --> 01:54:41.051
Just take it easy.

1472
01:54:41.075 --> 01:54:42.619
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1473
01:54:42.702 --> 01:54:45.830
Take it easy.

1474
01:54:55.006 --> 01:54:56.341
Rata Alada.

1475
01:55:01.262 --> 01:55:03.056
A falcon has wings, too.

1476
01:55:03.139 --> 01:55:05.058
Falcone is the rat?

1477
01:55:15.944 --> 01:55:19.697
Falcone works for you guys?

1478
01:55:19.781 --> 01:55:22.367
The mayor? The DA?

1479
01:55:25.328 --> 01:55:26.996
No.

1480
01:55:29.499 --> 01:55:30.834
We work for him.

1481
01:55:31.793 --> 01:55:33.086
Everybody does.

1482
01:55:33.169 --> 01:55:34.212
How?

1483
01:55:34.295 --> 01:55:36.464
Through Renewal.

1484
01:55:36.548 --> 01:55:37.841
Renewal is everything.

1485
01:55:37.924 --> 01:55:39.884
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1486
01:55:39.968 --> 01:55:41.135
After Thomas Wayne died,

1487
01:55:41.219 --> 01:55:43.555
they all went after it
like vultures.

1488
01:55:43.638 --> 01:55:47.392
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1489
01:55:47.475 --> 01:55:49.644
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1490
01:55:49.727 --> 01:55:50.937
laundering money.

1491
01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.856
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1492
01:55:52.939 --> 01:55:54.732
Everybody got a piece.

1493
01:55:54.816 --> 01:55:56.734
But Falcone wanted more.

1494
01:55:58.528 --> 01:56:01.906
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1495
01:56:03.074 --> 01:56:05.577
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1496
01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:08.538
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1497
01:56:08.621 --> 01:56:10.999
then install them all
as his puppets.

1498
01:56:11.082 --> 01:56:13.793
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1499
01:56:15.336 --> 01:56:17.922
Falcone's the mayor.

1500
01:56:18.006 --> 01:56:20.633
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1501
01:56:20.717 --> 01:56:22.635
Come on, Vengeance.

1502
01:56:22.719 --> 01:56:25.179
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1503
01:56:25.263 --> 01:56:26.639
This creep too.
Let's finish this.

1504
01:56:26.723 --> 01:56:27.849
- Oh, God!
- No!

1505
01:56:29.392 --> 01:56:31.019
We'll get him.

1506
01:56:31.102 --> 01:56:33.104
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1507
01:56:33.187 --> 01:56:36.316
- He owns the city!
- Cross that line,

1508
01:56:36.399 --> 01:56:38.401
you'll become just like him.

1509
01:56:38.484 --> 01:56:39.944
Listen to me.

1510
01:56:40.028 --> 01:56:42.030
Don't throw your life away.

1511
01:56:48.453 --> 01:56:49.913
Don't worry, honey.

1512
01:56:52.916 --> 01:56:54.250
I got nine of 'em.

1513
01:56:54.334 --> 01:56:56.544
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1514
01:56:57.712 --> 01:57:00.089
Oh, God!

1515
01:57:08.473 --> 01:57:10.113
She won't
get out of there alive.

1516
01:57:10.141 --> 01:57:12.341
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1517
01:57:12.393 --> 01:57:14.687
- I have to stop her.
- Don't you mean "we"?

1518
01:57:15.939 --> 01:57:17.774
I gotta do this my way.

1519
01:57:17.857 --> 01:57:18.900
And then what?

1520
01:57:19.734 --> 01:57:21.819
We do what Riddler said.

1521
01:57:21.903 --> 01:57:23.613
Bring the rat into the light.

1522
01:57:59.357 --> 01:58:01.442
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1523
01:58:01.526 --> 01:58:03.528
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1524
01:58:03.611 --> 01:58:05.071
Tell him it's about Annika.

1525
01:58:08.282 --> 01:58:10.284
Hey!

1526
01:58:10.368 --> 01:58:11.828
Look who it is, huh?

1527
01:58:11.911 --> 01:58:14.247
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1528
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:16.499
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1529
01:58:16.582 --> 01:58:18.084
Absolutely.

1530
01:58:19.836 --> 01:58:20.836
Alone?

1531
01:58:37.478 --> 01:58:38.563
Hey!

1532
01:58:48.823 --> 01:58:50.074
I'm just so worried.

1533
01:58:50.158 --> 01:58:51.909
I... I don't know
where she is.

1534
01:58:53.453 --> 01:58:56.914
And I know that
you're a very important man.

1535
01:58:56.998 --> 01:58:59.876
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1536
01:59:01.836 --> 01:59:05.631
Because she's been gone
so long, I'm beginning to...

1537
01:59:05.715 --> 01:59:08.217
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1538
01:59:08.301 --> 01:59:10.470
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1539
01:59:10.553 --> 01:59:13.556
No, that's okay,
I have a tissue.

1540
01:59:17.685 --> 01:59:19.437
- Mr. Falcone?
- Vinnie!

1541
01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.320
- Didn't I tell you?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1542
01:59:21.355 --> 01:59:23.566
I really think you're gonna
want to see this.

1543
01:59:25.526 --> 01:59:27.195
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1544
01:59:27.278 --> 01:59:28.613
I'll be right back.

1545
01:59:43.878 --> 01:59:45.296
Holy shit.

1546
01:59:45.379 --> 01:59:47.066
That recording,
provided to GC-1

1547
01:59:47.090 --> 01:59:49.342
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.

1548
01:59:49.425 --> 01:59:50.635
And we should warn you,

1549
01:59:50.718 --> 01:59:52.303
the contents
are extremely graphic,

1550
01:59:52.386 --> 01:59:55.139
and some of you
may find it disturbing.

1551
01:59:55.223 --> 01:59:57.225
He just said

1552
01:59:57.308 --> 01:59:59.227
they all made a deal with you.

1553
01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:00.520
Oh. Hmm.

1554
02:00:00.603 --> 02:00:02.355
He told you about that, huh?

1555
02:00:02.438 --> 02:00:03.940
The deal.

1556
02:00:04.023 --> 02:00:05.483
He said

1557
02:00:05.566 --> 02:00:08.820
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1558
02:00:08.903 --> 02:00:11.614
and that's how he became mayor.

1559
02:00:11.697 --> 02:00:14.408
He said you were
a very important man.

1560
02:00:14.492 --> 02:00:15.535
Right.

1561
02:00:16.452 --> 02:00:18.871
Hmm. Okay.

1562
02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.631
Revelations
of Mr. Falcone's secret role

1563
02:00:28.714 --> 02:00:29.882
as a mafia informant...

1564
02:00:30.466 --> 02:00:31.717
Hey, Dad.

1565
02:00:32.927 --> 02:00:34.220
What?

1566
02:00:34.303 --> 02:00:36.430
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1567
02:00:38.307 --> 02:00:39.809
You remember her?

1568
02:00:41.394 --> 02:00:42.436
Yeah.

1569
02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:44.981
Just...

1570
02:00:46.941 --> 02:00:48.101
Just put down the gun, honey.

1571
02:00:48.151 --> 02:00:49.318
This is for my mother.

1572
02:01:46.459 --> 02:01:47.668
I see him!

1573
02:02:31.545 --> 02:02:33.422
You don't think this hurts me?

1574
02:02:37.134 --> 02:02:40.304
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1575
02:02:56.612 --> 02:02:58.489
You made me do this.

1576
02:02:59.824 --> 02:03:01.701
Just like your mother.

1577
02:03:07.665 --> 02:03:09.041
He has to pay!

1578
02:03:12.837 --> 02:03:14.064
You don't have to pay with him.

1579
02:03:17.675 --> 02:03:19.218
You paid enough.

1580
02:03:53.753 --> 02:03:54.962
Jesus.

1581
02:03:55.046 --> 02:03:57.465
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1582
02:03:57.548 --> 02:03:58.788
You think you're gonna scare me

1583
02:03:58.841 --> 02:04:00.634
with that mask and that cape?

1584
02:04:00.718 --> 02:04:02.928
I'm gonna start crying,
and all of a sudden,

1585
02:04:03.012 --> 02:04:04.680
some big secret's comin' out?

1586
02:04:04.764 --> 02:04:06.432
Let me tell you something.

1587
02:04:06.515 --> 02:04:08.225
Whatever I know,

1588
02:04:08.309 --> 02:04:10.144
whatever I've done,

1589
02:04:10.227 --> 02:04:12.813
it's all going with me

1590
02:04:12.897 --> 02:04:14.648
to my grave.

1591
02:04:24.992 --> 02:04:27.119
What, are you with Zorro
over here?

1592
02:04:28.537 --> 02:04:31.040
Don't you know you boys
in blue work for me?

1593
02:04:38.798 --> 02:04:41.217
I guess
we don't all work for you.

1594
02:04:50.184 --> 02:04:52.395
You have the right
to remain silent.

1595
02:04:52.478 --> 02:04:54.772
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1596
02:04:54.855 --> 02:04:56.107
in a court of law.

1597
02:04:56.190 --> 02:04:57.608
You have the right
to an attorney.

1598
02:04:57.691 --> 02:04:58.943
If you cannot afford one,

1599
02:04:59.026 --> 02:05:00.670
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1600
02:05:00.694 --> 02:05:02.530
Do you understand these rights?

1601
02:05:03.906 --> 02:05:05.574
Do you understand?

1602
02:05:07.535 --> 02:05:08.619
Yeah.

1603
02:05:08.702 --> 02:05:10.621
I'll see you when I walk out.

1604
02:05:10.704 --> 02:05:12.123
With these rights in mind,

1605
02:05:12.206 --> 02:05:13.266
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1606
02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:14.583
Goddamn rat.

1607
02:05:16.544 --> 02:05:17.711
What'd you say?

1608
02:05:17.795 --> 02:05:19.713
Enjoy your night
at Blackgate, Carmine.

1609
02:05:20.756 --> 02:05:21.966
Probably be your last.

1610
02:05:22.049 --> 02:05:25.344
Oh-ho! So you're
a big man now, Oz, huh?

1611
02:05:25.428 --> 02:05:26.512
Maybe I am.

1612
02:05:26.595 --> 02:05:28.139
Really, Oz?

1613
02:05:28.222 --> 02:05:32.643
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1614
02:05:32.726 --> 02:05:33.936
I'll spray paint your ass!

1615
02:05:37.731 --> 02:05:39.191
What are you doing?
It wasn't me!

1616
02:05:39.275 --> 02:05:41.444
I didn't shoot!
I didn't shoot!

1617
02:05:42.695 --> 02:05:44.029
Get your hands off of me!

1618
02:06:03.674 --> 02:06:05.759
"Bring him into the light."

1619
02:06:09.221 --> 02:06:11.265
"And you'll find
where I'm at."

1620
02:06:11.348 --> 02:06:12.349
There!

1621
02:06:12.433 --> 02:06:14.351
The shots came from up there!

1622
02:06:15.895 --> 02:06:16.895
It's Riddler.

1623
02:06:18.856 --> 02:06:20.065
Gage, on me.

1624
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:21.317
Martinez, around back.

1625
02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.027
Nobody gets in there,
nobody gets out!

1626
02:07:37.434 --> 02:07:38.686
He's gone.

1627
02:07:48.362 --> 02:07:50.281
He's been here this whole time.

1628
02:07:50.364 --> 02:07:52.575
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1629
02:07:52.658 --> 02:07:54.135
Lieutenant,
we got a witness here,

1630
02:07:54.159 --> 02:07:55.578
says she saw someone coming down

1631
02:07:55.661 --> 02:07:57.101
the fire escape
right after the shot.

1632
02:07:57.162 --> 02:07:59.081
She said he went
into the corner diner.

1633
02:07:59.164 --> 02:08:02.293
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1634
02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:19.935
Police! Hands up!

1635
02:08:22.771 --> 02:08:24.857
He said put
your goddamn hands up,

1636
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:26.900
you son of a bitch.

1637
02:08:45.419 --> 02:08:47.504
I just ordered
a slice of pumpkin pie.

1638
02:08:50.382 --> 02:08:51.759
Stay still!

1639
02:08:51.842 --> 02:08:52.843
Now!

1640
02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:23.165
Which one is you?

1641
02:09:23.248 --> 02:09:25.542
You tell me.

1642
02:09:25.626 --> 02:09:27.127
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1643
02:09:30.047 --> 02:09:31.882
Get that son of a bitch
out of here!

1644
02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:47.832
...where even murdered mayor

1645
02:09:47.856 --> 02:09:49.525
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife
and son

1646
02:09:49.608 --> 02:09:52.403
have gathered in an
emotional show of city unity.

1647
02:09:52.486 --> 02:09:53.821
Our Dan O'Neil is live

1648
02:09:53.904 --> 02:09:55.048
inside Real's headquarters
right now...

1649
02:09:55.072 --> 02:09:56.115
Hey.

1650
02:10:20.472 --> 02:10:22.099
What are all these diaries?

1651
02:10:22.182 --> 02:10:24.560
They're ledgers.
He's got thousands.

1652
02:10:24.643 --> 02:10:28.188
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1653
02:10:28.272 --> 02:10:29.773
Got something back
on one of the IDs.

1654
02:10:29.857 --> 02:10:32.151
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1655
02:10:32.234 --> 02:10:34.111
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1656
02:10:34.194 --> 02:10:36.655
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1657
02:10:36.739 --> 02:10:38.615
What about chain of evidence?

1658
02:10:39.366 --> 02:10:40.659
You should see this.

1659
02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:48.125
He's wearing gloves.

1660
02:10:49.543 --> 02:10:51.628
"Friday, July 16th."

1661
02:10:51.712 --> 02:10:55.758
My life has been a cruel
riddle I could not solve,

1662
02:10:55.841 --> 02:10:58.844
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1663
02:10:58.927 --> 02:11:00.512
But then, today, I saw it.

1664
02:11:00.596 --> 02:11:04.725
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1665
02:11:06.059 --> 02:11:07.644
'Renewal.'

1666
02:11:07.728 --> 02:11:09.813
The empty promise
they sold to me

1667
02:11:09.897 --> 02:11:12.232
as a child in that orphanage.

1668
02:11:12.316 --> 02:11:15.319
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1669
02:11:15.402 --> 02:11:18.781
My whole life has been
preparing me for this.

1670
02:11:18.864 --> 02:11:21.325
The moment
when I would learn the truth.

1671
02:11:21.408 --> 02:11:23.118
When I could finally strike back

1672
02:11:23.202 --> 02:11:25.496
"and expose their lies."

1673
02:11:25.579 --> 02:11:29.291
"If you want people to
understand, really understand,

1674
02:11:29.374 --> 02:11:31.752
you can't just
give them the answers.

1675
02:11:31.835 --> 02:11:33.170
You have to confront them,

1676
02:11:33.253 --> 02:11:35.798
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1677
02:11:35.881 --> 02:11:38.133
just like they tortured me.

1678
02:11:38.217 --> 02:11:41.011
"I know now
what I must become."

1679
02:11:43.931 --> 02:11:45.224
Jesus.

1680
02:11:51.188 --> 02:11:53.690
I don't think that rat
likes you, man.

1681
02:11:53.774 --> 02:11:55.150
This one's not a rat.

1682
02:12:11.917 --> 02:12:13.126
What is that?

1683
02:12:44.575 --> 02:12:45.909
Some kind of pry tool?

1684
02:12:45.993 --> 02:12:47.244
Is it a chisel?

1685
02:12:47.327 --> 02:12:48.787
It's a murder weapon.

1686
02:12:48.871 --> 02:12:50.747
He killed Mitchell with it.

1687
02:12:50.831 --> 02:12:52.591
The edge will match
the floorboard impression

1688
02:12:52.666 --> 02:12:53.834
in the mayor's study.

1689
02:13:02.467 --> 02:13:04.428
"My confession"?

1690
02:13:04.511 --> 02:13:05.762
What's he confessing to?

1691
02:13:05.846 --> 02:13:07.556
He already told us
he killed Mitchell.

1692
02:13:07.639 --> 02:13:08.891
This isn't over.

1693
02:13:08.974 --> 02:13:10.142
Oh, man.

1694
02:13:10.225 --> 02:13:11.786
He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1695
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:14.271
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1696
02:13:21.528 --> 02:13:24.281
His final post was last night.

1697
02:13:24.364 --> 02:13:25.741
Some video.

1698
02:13:25.824 --> 02:13:27.635
Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1699
02:13:27.659 --> 02:13:29.036
Can you get in?

1700
02:13:29.119 --> 02:13:30.746
Copying his drive now.

1701
02:13:30.829 --> 02:13:34.207
Take some time,
but we'll get in.

1702
02:13:45.344 --> 02:13:48.055
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1703
02:13:49.765 --> 02:13:52.142
"The Truth Unmasked."

1704
02:13:52.225 --> 02:13:53.894
I think I'm his last target.

1705
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.731
You?

1706
02:13:57.814 --> 02:13:59.983
Maybe this is all
coming to an end.

1707
02:14:00.525 --> 02:14:02.235
What is?

1708
02:14:02.319 --> 02:14:03.654
The Batman.

1709
02:14:09.159 --> 02:14:10.327
Yeah?

1710
02:14:21.588 --> 02:14:22.839
Right.

1711
02:14:25.592 --> 02:14:29.680
Riddler's asking for you.
At Arkham.

1712
02:14:37.062 --> 02:14:38.605
You're a good cop.

1713
02:15:02.963 --> 02:15:06.049
I told you
I'd see you in hell.

1714
02:15:06.133 --> 02:15:08.218
What do you
want from me?

1715
02:15:08.301 --> 02:15:10.220
"Want"?

1716
02:15:10.303 --> 02:15:11.722
If only you knew how long

1717
02:15:11.805 --> 02:15:14.016
I've been waiting for this day.

1718
02:15:15.142 --> 02:15:17.310
For this moment.

1719
02:15:17.394 --> 02:15:21.398
I've been invisible
my whole life.

1720
02:15:21.481 --> 02:15:24.276
I guess I won't be anymore,
will I?

1721
02:15:25.736 --> 02:15:28.113
They'll remember me now.

1722
02:15:28.196 --> 02:15:30.157
They'll remember both of us.

1723
02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.502
Bruce...

1724
02:15:45.338 --> 02:15:47.215
Wayne.

1725
02:15:49.509 --> 02:15:53.346
Bruce...

1726
02:15:54.765 --> 02:15:57.642
Wayne.

1727
02:16:08.695 --> 02:16:11.281
You know, I was there that day.

1728
02:16:13.784 --> 02:16:15.535
The day the great Thomas Wayne

1729
02:16:15.619 --> 02:16:17.120
announced
he was running for mayor,

1730
02:16:17.204 --> 02:16:19.706
made all those promises.

1731
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.627
Well, a week later he was dead,

1732
02:16:23.710 --> 02:16:26.713
and everybody
just forgot about us.

1733
02:16:26.797 --> 02:16:30.508
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1734
02:16:30.592 --> 02:16:34.388
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1735
02:16:34.971 --> 02:16:36.514
Orphan.

1736
02:16:42.103 --> 02:16:45.440
Living in some tower
over the park

1737
02:16:45.523 --> 02:16:48.400
isn't being an orphan.

1738
02:16:48.485 --> 02:16:53.865
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1739
02:16:53.949 --> 02:16:55.575
Don't you tell me.

1740
02:16:58.077 --> 02:17:01.080
Do you know
what being an orphan is?

1741
02:17:01.164 --> 02:17:04.834
It's 30 kids to a room.

1742
02:17:04.918 --> 02:17:07.504
Twelve years old
and already a drophead,

1743
02:17:07.587 --> 02:17:09.172
numbing the pain.

1744
02:17:10.757 --> 02:17:12.049
You wake up screaming

1745
02:17:12.133 --> 02:17:16.428
with rats chewing your fingers.

1746
02:17:16.513 --> 02:17:19.808
And every winter
one of the babies die

1747
02:17:19.891 --> 02:17:22.227
because it's so cold.

1748
02:17:23.477 --> 02:17:26.106
But, oh, no.

1749
02:17:28.859 --> 02:17:30.818
Let's talk about the billionaire

1750
02:17:30.901 --> 02:17:32.404
with the lying, dead daddy,

1751
02:17:32.486 --> 02:17:35.156
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

1752
02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:36.282
Doesn't it?

1753
02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:39.785
Bruce...

1754
02:17:40.787 --> 02:17:42.746
Wayne.

1755
02:17:46.250 --> 02:17:49.504
He's the only one we didn't get.

1756
02:17:52.716 --> 02:17:57.219
But we got the rest of 'em,
didn't we?

1757
02:17:57.303 --> 02:18:01.391
All those slick,
sleazy, phony pricks.

1758
02:18:04.477 --> 02:18:05.686
God.

1759
02:18:06.646 --> 02:18:07.981
Look at you.

1760
02:18:09.566 --> 02:18:11.942
Your mask is amazing.

1761
02:18:12.026 --> 02:18:15.070
I wish you could've
seen me in mine.

1762
02:18:15.155 --> 02:18:16.406
Ain't it funny?

1763
02:18:16.489 --> 02:18:18.741
All everyone wants to do
is unmask you,

1764
02:18:18.825 --> 02:18:20.784
but they're missing the point.

1765
02:18:22.162 --> 02:18:24.998
You and I both know,

1766
02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.584
I'm looking at the real you
right now.

1767
02:18:27.666 --> 02:18:29.919
My mask allowed me to be myself,

1768
02:18:30.003 --> 02:18:31.421
completely.

1769
02:18:31.504 --> 02:18:33.088
No shame,

1770
02:18:33.964 --> 02:18:35.049
no limits.

1771
02:18:35.133 --> 02:18:36.759
Why did you write me?

1772
02:18:37.636 --> 02:18:38.719
What do you mean?

1773
02:18:38.802 --> 02:18:40.388
All those cards.

1774
02:18:40.472 --> 02:18:42.014
I told you,

1775
02:18:42.097 --> 02:18:43.242
we've been doing this together.

1776
02:18:43.266 --> 02:18:44.516
You're a part of this.

1777
02:18:44.601 --> 02:18:45.477
We didn't do anything together.

1778
02:18:45.559 --> 02:18:46.559
We did.

1779
02:18:46.602 --> 02:18:48.230
What did we just do?

1780
02:18:48.312 --> 02:18:50.207
I asked you to bring him
into the light, and you did.

1781
02:18:50.231 --> 02:18:51.398
We're such a good team.

1782
02:18:51.482 --> 02:18:52.816
We're not a team.

1783
02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.945
I never could have gotten him
out of there.

1784
02:18:55.027 --> 02:18:57.405
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

1785
02:18:57.489 --> 02:19:00.784
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1786
02:19:00.866 --> 02:19:02.576
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1787
02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:03.912
You gave me that.

1788
02:19:03.995 --> 02:19:05.120
I gave you nothing.

1789
02:19:05.204 --> 02:19:07.499
You showed me what was possible.

1790
02:19:07.582 --> 02:19:10.709
You showed me
all it takes is fear

1791
02:19:10.793 --> 02:19:12.671
and a little focused violence.

1792
02:19:12.754 --> 02:19:14.297
You inspired me.

1793
02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:15.966
You're out of your goddamn mind.

1794
02:19:17.049 --> 02:19:18.550
What?

1795
02:19:18.634 --> 02:19:20.362
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1796
02:19:20.387 --> 02:19:21.763
How can you say that?

1797
02:19:21.846 --> 02:19:23.347
You think you'll be remembered?

1798
02:19:23.431 --> 02:19:25.475
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1799
02:19:25.558 --> 02:19:27.268
- begging for attention.
- No.

1800
02:19:27.352 --> 02:19:28.632
You're gonna die alone
in Arkham.

1801
02:19:28.686 --> 02:19:31.314
- No. No, no, no!
- A nobody!

1802
02:19:33.066 --> 02:19:34.900
No!

1803
02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:39.155
Ahhh!

1804
02:19:39.239 --> 02:19:42.032
This is not how
this was supposed to go!

1805
02:19:42.993 --> 02:19:46.495
Ahhh!

1806
02:19:46.579 --> 02:19:50.125
I had it all planned out!

1807
02:19:50.208 --> 02:19:52.460
We were gonna be safe here.

1808
02:19:52.544 --> 02:19:55.964
We could watch
the whole thing together.

1809
02:19:56.047 --> 02:19:57.132
Watch what?

1810
02:19:57.215 --> 02:19:58.967
Everything!

1811
02:20:07.183 --> 02:20:08.893
It was all there.

1812
02:20:10.854 --> 02:20:13.398
You mean,
you didn't figure it out?

1813
02:20:17.444 --> 02:20:21.614
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1814
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:26.036
I guess I gave you
too much credit.

1815
02:20:26.119 --> 02:20:27.871
What have you done?

1816
02:20:27.954 --> 02:20:33.043
What's black and blue
and dead all over?

1817
02:20:35.837 --> 02:20:37.672
You.

1818
02:20:39.174 --> 02:20:41.509
If you think you can stop
what's coming.

1819
02:20:42.761 --> 02:20:45.639
What have you done?

1820
02:20:45.722 --> 02:20:51.936
♪ Ave Maria ♪

1821
02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:54.022

Hey!

What are you doing in here?

1828
02:22:05.719 --> 02:22:08.555
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1829
02:22:14.936 --> 02:22:18.148
Boy, this guy's
a real nutjob, huh?

1830
02:22:18.231 --> 02:22:21.192
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1831
02:22:25.738 --> 02:22:28.741
My uncle's a...
He's an installer.

1832
02:22:28.825 --> 02:22:31.077
You know, it's a...
Oh, you know.

1833
02:22:31.161 --> 02:22:33.496
It's a... a tucker.

1834
02:22:51.181 --> 02:22:52.182
Huh.

1835
02:23:07.322 --> 02:23:09.032
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1836
02:23:09.115 --> 02:23:11.826
What are you doing?

1837
02:23:42.315 --> 02:23:43.900
Hey, guys.

1838
02:23:43.983 --> 02:23:46.069
Uh, thanks for all the comments,

1839
02:23:46.152 --> 02:23:47.737
and, uh, a special thanks
to everyone

1840
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:49.280
for the tips on detonators.

1841
02:23:49.364 --> 02:23:50.573
Detonators?

1842
02:23:50.657 --> 02:23:52.075
I just want to say this will be

1843
02:23:52.158 --> 02:23:55.537
my last post
for a little while, and, uh...

1844
02:23:57.622 --> 02:23:59.749
what this community
has meant to me

1845
02:23:59.832 --> 02:24:03.670
these weeks, these months,

1846
02:24:03.753 --> 02:24:06.297
let's just say none of us...

1847
02:24:07.924 --> 02:24:10.134
is alone anymore. Okay?

1848
02:24:10.844 --> 02:24:12.345
Jesus.

1849
02:24:16.683 --> 02:24:20.562
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1850
02:24:21.854 --> 02:24:24.607
And Bella Real will win.

1851
02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:27.777
She promised real change.

1852
02:24:27.861 --> 02:24:30.280
But we know the truth, don't we?

1853
02:24:30.363 --> 02:24:32.448
You've seen
Gotham's true face now.

1854
02:24:32.532 --> 02:24:34.450
Together, we've unmasked it.

1855
02:24:34.534 --> 02:24:37.370
Its corruption, its perversion

1856
02:24:37.453 --> 02:24:41.416
masquerading
under the guise of renewal.

1857
02:24:41.499 --> 02:24:45.420
But unmasking is not enough.

1858
02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.593
The day of judgment
is finally upon us.

1859
02:24:51.676 --> 02:24:54.095
And now it is time

1860
02:24:55.096 --> 02:24:57.473
for retribution.

1861
02:24:57.557 --> 02:25:00.476
I've parked seven vans

1862
02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:03.021
all along the city seawall.

1863
02:25:04.147 --> 02:25:06.107
And on the big night,

1864
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:08.443
they will go boom.

1865
02:25:22.415 --> 02:25:30.415
Boom!

1866
02:25:33.259 --> 02:25:35.386
When the vans blow,

1867
02:25:35.470 --> 02:25:38.181
the flooding
will happen so fast,

1868
02:25:38.264 --> 02:25:41.351
evacuation
will not be an option.

1869
02:25:41.434 --> 02:25:44.354
Those who are not washed away

1870
02:25:44.437 --> 02:25:46.856
will race through the streets
in terror.

1871
02:25:46.939 --> 02:25:48.816
Call Gordon.

1872
02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:51.027
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1873
02:25:52.612 --> 02:25:54.739
As breaking news
hits higher ground

1874
02:25:54.822 --> 02:25:56.532
in Gotham Square Garden,

1875
02:25:56.616 --> 02:25:59.243
celebrations will turn to panic,

1876
02:25:59.327 --> 02:26:00.995
as the venue becomes

1877
02:26:01.079 --> 02:26:04.207
the city's shelter
of last resort.

1878
02:26:05.667 --> 02:26:09.629
And that's where
all of you come in.

1879
02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:19.138
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1880
02:26:19.222 --> 02:26:21.557
The pigs will have me
in their custody,

1881
02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:23.559
but that's okay.

1882
02:26:23.643 --> 02:26:28.147
Because then
it will be your turn.

1883
02:26:28.231 --> 02:26:32.485
You'll be there, waiting.

1884
02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:45.998
It's time for the lies
to finally end.

1885
02:26:46.082 --> 02:26:50.586
False promises of renewal?

1886
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:52.004
Change?

1887
02:26:52.088 --> 02:26:55.591
We'll give them real,
real change now.

1888
02:26:55.675 --> 02:26:59.053
We've spent our lives
in this wretched place,

1889
02:26:59.137 --> 02:27:01.180
suffering!

1890
02:27:01.264 --> 02:27:03.599
Wondering, "Why us?"

1891
02:27:03.683 --> 02:27:06.936
Now they will spend their
last moments wondering,

1892
02:27:07.019 --> 02:27:09.105
why them?

1893
02:27:09.188 --> 02:27:11.399
I can't get through!
The lines are down.

1894
02:27:16.904 --> 02:27:19.532
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1895
02:27:19.615 --> 02:27:21.242
I'm just trying
to get out of town, man!

1896
02:27:21.325 --> 02:27:24.245
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1897
02:27:24.328 --> 02:27:25.764
You're gonna have to go
inside the Garden

1898
02:27:25.788 --> 02:27:27.182
with everyone else.

1899
02:27:35.923 --> 02:27:37.818
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1900
02:27:37.842 --> 02:27:39.403
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1901
02:27:39.427 --> 02:27:41.262
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1902
02:27:41.345 --> 02:27:42.680
We got an active situation.

1903
02:27:42.764 --> 02:27:44.484
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1904
02:27:44.515 --> 02:27:45.909
and get the mayor-elect out
of here, now. Where is she?

1905
02:27:45.933 --> 02:27:47.185
- I can take you there.
- Come!

1906
02:28:23.054 --> 02:28:24.573
If we don't close
the doors, we're gonna have...

1907
02:28:24.597 --> 02:28:25.848
- MCU.
- ...huge problems.

1908
02:28:25.932 --> 02:28:27.409
The water's
already started to breach.

1909
02:28:27.433 --> 02:28:28.452
I thought this was a shelter
of last resort.

1910
02:28:28.476 --> 02:28:29.727
Yeah, for a hurricane,

1911
02:28:29.811 --> 02:28:31.437
but not if the whole seawall
comes down.

1912
02:28:31.521 --> 02:28:32.998
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1913
02:28:33.022 --> 02:28:34.649
All right.
I'll go calm down the crowd

1914
02:28:34.732 --> 02:28:36.418
- so we can get everyone in.
- It's not safe for you here.

1915
02:28:36.442 --> 02:28:37.860
We need to get you out,
Ms. Real.

1916
02:28:37.944 --> 02:28:39.963
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1917
02:28:39.987 --> 02:28:41.739
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1918
02:28:41.823 --> 02:28:43.908
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing,

1919
02:28:43.991 --> 02:28:44.992
but I'm not.

1920
02:28:45.076 --> 02:28:46.661
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1921
02:28:51.749 --> 02:28:53.042
Everyone, everyone,

1922
02:28:53.125 --> 02:28:55.086
if I could just
get your attention.

1923
02:28:55.169 --> 02:28:57.672
Please!
I just need your attention!

1924
02:29:13.479 --> 02:29:14.647
You're okay!

1925
02:30:45.363 --> 02:30:48.032
Hey! Hey!
How do I get up there?

1926
02:30:48.115 --> 02:30:49.325
Follow me, sir.

1927
02:32:59.205 --> 02:33:00.706
No, no. It's okay.

1928
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:01.874
It's okay.

1929
02:33:01.957 --> 02:33:04.126
It's okay.

1930
02:33:05.669 --> 02:33:07.880
It's done now. It's done.

1931
02:33:10.549 --> 02:33:11.884
It's over.

1932
02:34:07.148 --> 02:34:08.232
Hey!

1933
02:34:08.315 --> 02:34:10.943
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1934
02:34:11.026 --> 02:34:13.028
Take it easy.

1935
02:34:13.112 --> 02:34:14.196
Easy.

1936
02:34:42.725 --> 02:34:43.851
Jesus.

1937
02:34:53.652 --> 02:34:55.362
Who the hell are you?

1938
02:34:59.575 --> 02:35:00.576
Me?

1939
02:35:03.704 --> 02:35:05.080
I'm Vengeance.

1940
02:38:37.668 --> 02:38:40.045
Wednesday, November 6th.

1941
02:38:43.215 --> 02:38:45.175
The city is underwater.

1942
02:38:47.594 --> 02:38:49.471
The National Guard is coming.

1943
02:38:51.432 --> 02:38:54.685
Martial law is in effect,

1944
02:38:54.768 --> 02:38:56.603
but the criminal element
never sleeps.

1945
02:38:59.398 --> 02:39:03.110
Looting and lawlessness
will be rampant

1946
02:39:03.193 --> 02:39:06.822
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

1947
02:39:06.905 --> 02:39:09.450
I can already see
things will get worse

1948
02:39:09.533 --> 02:39:10.826
before they get better.

1949
02:39:13.537 --> 02:39:16.915
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

1950
02:39:18.208 --> 02:39:20.169
We will rebuild.

1951
02:39:20.252 --> 02:39:22.254
But not just our city.

1952
02:39:22.337 --> 02:39:24.715
We must rebuild people's faith

1953
02:39:24.798 --> 02:39:26.550
in our institutions,

1954
02:39:26.633 --> 02:39:28.760
in our elected officials,

1955
02:39:28.844 --> 02:39:30.679
in each other.

1956
02:39:30.763 --> 02:39:33.891
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1957
02:39:38.437 --> 02:39:40.314
I'm starting to see now.

1958
02:39:41.648 --> 02:39:43.942
I have had an effect here...

1959
02:39:45.903 --> 02:39:47.946
but not the one I intended.

1960
02:39:50.157 --> 02:39:53.368
Vengeance won't change the past,

1961
02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:57.080
mine or anyone else's.

1962
02:39:59.458 --> 02:40:01.543
I have to become more.

1963
02:40:04.546 --> 02:40:07.132
People need hope.

1964
02:40:07.216 --> 02:40:09.676
To know
someone's out there for them.

1965
02:40:13.347 --> 02:40:15.098
The city's angry,

1966
02:40:15.974 --> 02:40:17.392
scarred,

1967
02:40:18.268 --> 02:40:19.561
like me.

1968
02:40:21.563 --> 02:40:24.900
Our scars can destroy us.

1969
02:40:24.983 --> 02:40:27.861
Even after the physical wounds
have healed.

1970
02:40:29.404 --> 02:40:31.240
But if we survive them,

1971
02:40:32.658 --> 02:40:34.618
they can transform us.

1972
02:40:36.370 --> 02:40:38.413
They can give us the power

1973
02:40:39.331 --> 02:40:40.874
to endure...

1974
02:40:42.167 --> 02:40:44.378
and the strength to fight.

1975
02:40:47.089 --> 02:40:49.091
We are live.
As you can see,

1976
02:40:49.174 --> 02:40:52.177
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden,

1977
02:40:52.261 --> 02:40:53.679
helping to save the lives

1978
02:40:53.762 --> 02:40:55.556
of hundreds of victims.

1979
02:40:55.639 --> 02:40:57.099
And now as first responders

1980
02:40:57.182 --> 02:40:58.743
desperately scramble
to help the injured,

1981
02:40:58.767 --> 02:41:01.144
a mysterious masked man emerges,

1982
02:41:01.228 --> 02:41:03.689
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

1983
02:41:03.772 --> 02:41:06.358
Isn't that just terrible?

1984
02:41:07.693 --> 02:41:09.444
Him...

1985
02:41:09.528 --> 02:41:13.907
raining on your parade
like that?

1986
02:41:18.245 --> 02:41:20.330
What is it they say?

1987
02:41:21.415 --> 02:41:23.667
"One day you're on top..."

1988
02:41:25.210 --> 02:41:26.879
The next,

1989
02:41:28.213 --> 02:41:30.632
"you're a clown."

1990
02:41:32.509 --> 02:41:33.677
Well...

1991
02:41:35.262 --> 02:41:38.265
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1992
02:41:40.517 --> 02:41:43.270
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1993
02:41:44.521 --> 02:41:46.398
You did so well.

1994
02:41:50.861 --> 02:41:51.903
And you know,

1995
02:41:53.447 --> 02:41:56.783
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1996
02:42:06.752 --> 02:42:08.503
Who are you?

1997
02:42:08.587 --> 02:42:11.173
Well, that's the question,

1998
02:42:12.382 --> 02:42:13.550
isn't it?

1999
02:42:16.637 --> 02:42:19.056
Riddle me this...

2000
02:42:21.266 --> 02:42:24.019
"The less of them you have,

2001
02:42:24.102 --> 02:42:28.023
the more one is worth."

2002
02:42:33.445 --> 02:42:35.197
A friend.

2003
02:43:01.765 --> 02:43:03.183
You're leaving.

2004
02:43:03.266 --> 02:43:04.393
Jesus.

2005
02:43:06.186 --> 02:43:07.896
Don't you ever just say hello?

2006
02:43:12.776 --> 02:43:14.236
Where will you go?

2007
02:43:15.654 --> 02:43:18.448
I don't know. Upstate.

2008
02:43:18.532 --> 02:43:20.283
Bludhaven, maybe.

2009
02:43:21.159 --> 02:43:22.160
Why?

2010
02:43:23.286 --> 02:43:24.579
You asking me to stay?

2011
02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:33.880
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2012
02:43:33.964 --> 02:43:36.633
With Carmine gone, it's only
gonna get worse for you.

2013
02:43:36.717 --> 02:43:38.635
There's gonna be a power grab.

2014
02:43:40.053 --> 02:43:41.221
It'll be bloody.

2015
02:43:41.847 --> 02:43:43.056
I know.

2016
02:43:44.766 --> 02:43:46.017
But the city can change.

2017
02:43:46.101 --> 02:43:47.310
It won't.

2018
02:43:48.353 --> 02:43:49.688
I have to try.

2019
02:43:49.771 --> 02:43:51.571
It's gonna kill you
eventually. You know that.

2020
02:43:53.525 --> 02:43:54.651
Listen.

2021
02:43:57.028 --> 02:43:58.363
Why don't you come with me?

2022
02:43:59.239 --> 02:44:01.324
Get into some trouble.

2023
02:44:01.408 --> 02:44:03.285
Knock off some
CEO hedge fund types.

2024
02:44:03.368 --> 02:44:05.620
It'll be fun.

2025
02:44:05.704 --> 02:44:07.247
The bat and the cat.

2026
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:10.542
It's got a nice ring.

2027
02:44:23.805 --> 02:44:25.223
Who am I kidding?

2028
02:44:26.641 --> 02:44:28.852
You're already spoken for.

2029
02:44:40.697 --> 02:44:42.073
You should go.

2030
02:44:50.499 --> 02:44:51.500
Selina...

2031
02:44:55.504 --> 02:44:57.255
Take care of yourself.
