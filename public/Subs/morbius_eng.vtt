1
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.211
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.

2
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.455
Set the trap at the mouth
of the cave, please.

3
00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.300
You need a doctor?

4
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.002
I am a doctor.

5
00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:34.339
It's impressive, don't you think?

6
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.741
Vampire bats weigh almost nothing,

7
00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.312
but they can down a creature
nearly ten times their size.

8
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.620
Wow.

9
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:51.791
What are you using as bait?

10
00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:53.326
You volunteering?

11
00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.928
Leaving.

12
00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.798
Pay me now.

13
00:03:59.932 --> 00:04:01.700
Before the sun goes down.

14
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:13.279
You throw in that bushcrafter
on your belt and we have a deal.

15
00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.696
Come on.

16
00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:16.243
Move!

17
00:05:36.163 --> 00:05:39.132
Should be able to
take better care of you here.

18
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:45.840
Everyone's here to help you.

19
00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:51.279
Michael, this is Lucian.
Lucian, Michael.

20
00:05:51.412 --> 00:05:53.881
Michael knows more
about this place than I do.

21
00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:56.517
Play nice.

22
00:05:58.052 --> 00:05:59.253
Hello.

23
00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:01.289
Hello, Milo.

24
00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:02.990
My name's Lucian.

25
00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.994
The person
who was here before was Milo.

26
00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:08.628
No.

27
00:06:08.763 --> 00:06:10.965
He was also the new Milo.

28
00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.468
And before him
was the other new Milo.

29
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.137
I don't even remember the first Milo.

30
00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:18.873
How long have you been here?

31
00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:21.776
Long as I can remember.

32
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.779
- And you're still not cured?
- There is no cure.

33
00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.982
There's something missing
from our DNA.

34
00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:29.917
<i>Like a piece of a puzzle.</i>

35
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:33.121
<i>And until they find it,
the only way to stay alive</i>

36
00:06:33.254 --> 00:06:35.523
<i>is an oil change three times a day.</i>

37
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.998
What would you do
if you could be normal?

38
00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:45.067
Just for an hour?

39
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.104
I don't think about it.

40
00:06:49.238 --> 00:06:51.907
Hey, look at the freaks!
Look at them!

41
00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.215
Best not to be outside
when school gets out.

42
00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.184
Like the original Spartans,

43
00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:05.220
we are the few against the many.

44
00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:12.561
Milo?

45
00:07:14.363 --> 00:07:15.497
Milo?

46
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:17.599
Nurse?

47
00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:28.610
Okay...

48
00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:38.420
Lucian.

49
00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:41.590
Lucian!

50
00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:50.333
With one of these?

51
00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:52.735
It took a team of scientists
to build that machine

52
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:55.071
and you fixed it
with a ballpoint pen?

53
00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:04.280
There's a school
for gifted children in New York.

54
00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:08.351
I think that I could get them
to agree to cover your tuition

55
00:08:08.484 --> 00:08:12.255
and provide private care
to help manage your condition.

56
00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:16.226
Somewhere you could study,
learn, hone your skills.

57
00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:20.663
You have a gift, Michael.

58
00:08:20.797 --> 00:08:24.601
I don't think I could forgive
myself if I saw it go to waste.

59
00:08:25.902 --> 00:08:27.203
<i>"Dear Milo,</i>

60
00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:28.938
<i>"this isn't goodbye.</i>

61
00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:31.274
<i>"I'm gonna find a cure for us,</i>

62
00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:33.876
<i>"so we can be cranky old men someday.</i>

63
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.111
<i>"Your friend, Michael.</i>

64
00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:38.081
<i>"P.S. You shouldn't
have unfolded this.</i>

65
00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:40.283
<i>"Now you'll never
get it back together.</i>

66
00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:42.217
<i>See you this summer."</i>

67
00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:45.154
No.

68
00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.796
"Dear Milo..."

69
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.798
Please, can I have my letter back?

70
00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:57.601
- What?
- Please, can I have my letter?

71
00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:58.936
Okay. Here.

72
00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:02.940
Please. Ah!

73
00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:05.309
Please!

74
00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:07.411
Please!

75
00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:12.049
Stop.

76
00:09:17.621 --> 00:09:19.056
Go away!

77
00:09:23.627 --> 00:09:25.729
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.

78
00:09:27.097 --> 00:09:28.899
He tried to steal my letter!

79
00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:30.934
Milo, Milo, stop.

80
00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:33.304
Stop. Stop. Stop.

81
00:09:34.405 --> 00:09:35.706
What about Milo?

82
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:38.342
I'll look after Milo.

83
00:09:38.475 --> 00:09:39.677
He needs me.

84
00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:45.282
Michael Morbius
completed his doctorate by 19

85
00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:47.452
and quickly established himself

86
00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:51.723
as the world's leading authority
on blood-borne diseases.

87
00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:54.025
His development of artificial blood

88
00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:57.696
has saved more lives than penicillin.

89
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.831
Michael Morbius,

90
00:09:59.964 --> 00:10:01.966
please step forward

91
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.202
to acknowledge
the receipt of your prize

92
00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:07.505
from His Majesty, the King of Sweden.

93
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.190
I can't believe you
dissed the king of Sweden.

94
00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:27.359
The king and the queen,
their loyal subjects,

95
00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:31.730
all of Scandinavia and
the entire scientific community.

96
00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:33.665
Yeah, but who does that?

97
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:37.402
Well, Anna, we both know
I have issues.

98
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:40.405
But, hey, I kept the program.

99
00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:48.113
There you are.

100
00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:50.282
- Hey, Dr. Bancroft.
- Hey, Anna.

101
00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:53.285
- We going to play?
- Oh, I don't think so.

102
00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:56.288
See, now that Dr. Morbius
is back,

103
00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:58.290
maybe you should
try losing for a while,

104
00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:01.260
- see how that feels.
- Not gonna happen.

105
00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.696
- Michael.
- Uh, yes?

106
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.132
- You got a minute?
- Of course.

107
00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.068
New one. For your collection.

108
00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:13.539
Dr. Morbius is in trouble.

109
00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.041
I'm in trouble.

110
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.377
"I can't accept a prize

111
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.113
for the by-product
of a failed experiment."

112
00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:23.115
- Lab 1.
- Front page,

113
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:27.953
"American Scientist
Rejects Nobel Prize."

114
00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:30.256
You know that people
actually like writing checks

115
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.124
to Nobel laureates?

116
00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:35.394
Makes them feel better
about their investment.

117
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.799
It would help if you stuck
around long enough to cash them.

118
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.801
You're pushing yourself

119
00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.435
too hard.

120
00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.007
Does our generous benefactor, Milo,

121
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.342
know what you're actually doing here?

122
00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:52.479
What am I actually doing here?

123
00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:55.750
Remixing human DNA with bat DNA.

124
00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:58.853
- I have no idea what you're...
- Talking about?

125
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:01.655
Is anything ringing a bell?

126
00:12:01.789 --> 00:12:03.791
No bells ringing. Uh...

127
00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:06.493
Okay. Maybe this
will jog your memory.

128
00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:09.029
I wouldn't go
in there if I were you.

129
00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.404
That is a...

130
00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:19.639
- It's a fish tank.
- Hmm.

131
00:12:19.774 --> 00:12:20.908
Like, for

132
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.844
flying mammals.

133
00:12:23.945 --> 00:12:25.345
Oh, I see.

134
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.514
Some friends I brought back
from Costa Rica.

135
00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:29.750
So when were you gonna tell me?

136
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:34.654
More importantly,
how did you get my pass code?

137
00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:36.490
It's the first six digits
of pi backwards.

138
00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:38.191
It's your password for everything.

139
00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.659
You should change that.

140
00:12:39.794 --> 00:12:41.628
You could lose your license for this.

141
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:45.532
I'm not gonna need it
much longer, doctor.

142
00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:49.369
You, on the other hand, will.

143
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.375
You know, there's something
called "plausible deniability."

144
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:56.210
You should be thanking me.

145
00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:04.485
These are the only mammals on Earth

146
00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:08.489
that have evolved
to feed exclusively on blood.

147
00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:10.258
So in order to drink it,

148
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:15.730
these bats produce saliva that
contains unique anticoagulants.

149
00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:18.466
So your theory is, if you can
successfully splice

150
00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:19.835
vampire genes into your DNA,

151
00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.837
it would allow your body to produce

152
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.371
those same anticoagulants.

153
00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:25.206
Yes.

154
00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.174
It would be a cure.

155
00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:29.377
At what cost?

156
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.345
The fusion of different species

157
00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.715
is a legacy
we already carry in our bodies.

158
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.386
Viruses insinuating
their nucleic acid onto our own

159
00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:41.088
over hundreds of thousands of years.

160
00:13:41.222 --> 00:13:42.824
That's evolution.
This is different.

161
00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.225
I don't think it is.

162
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:49.196
We have to push the boundaries,
take the risks.

163
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.098
Without that,

164
00:13:51.232 --> 00:13:53.769
there is no science.

165
00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:55.470
No medicine.

166
00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:57.774
No breakthroughs at all.

167
00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:06.983
Okay.

168
00:14:17.426 --> 00:14:19.963
Test subject
for cell combination 117.

169
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.753
Come on, come on, come on.

170
00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:04.808
Test subject 117 has resulted in

171
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.710
failure.

172
00:15:13.017 --> 00:15:15.052
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

173
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.090
I should've died years ago, Martine.

174
00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:24.094
Why am I still alive
if not to fix this?

175
00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:27.163
To save my best friend, Milo.

176
00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:29.198
And everyone else like us.

177
00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:30.667
Not like this.

178
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:33.670
Dr. Morbius, it's Anna.

179
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:46.241
Her temperature's spiking,

180
00:15:46.282 --> 00:15:48.852
and her kidneys are shutting down.

181
00:15:48.986 --> 00:15:52.923
We have to induce a coma
before she has a stroke.

182
00:15:53.057 --> 00:15:54.390
A hundred milligrams of propofol.

183
00:15:54.524 --> 00:15:56.359
- Sure.
- Now.

184
00:15:57.461 --> 00:15:58.729
Come on.

185
00:16:00.197 --> 00:16:01.766
It's okay.

186
00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:05.003
It's okay. We got you.

187
00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.839
There you go.

188
00:16:08.907 --> 00:16:10.075
There you go.

189
00:16:12.043 --> 00:16:13.178
Thank you, nurse.

190
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.446
We're gonna let you sleep a bit.

191
00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:20.584
Take a nice long nap.

192
00:16:30.294 --> 00:16:32.496
- Michael.
- What?

193
00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:35.733
It worked.

194
00:16:54.953 --> 00:16:56.788
Dr. Michael Morbius.

195
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.426
Some
crippled guy's here to see the Boss.

196
00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:04.063
Michael! Get over here!

197
00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:07.800
As long
as I am a cripple you'll be fine.

198
00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:10.102
♪ Stop dreaming
Of the quiet life... ♪

199
00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:12.503
You're late. I was trying out

200
00:17:12.637 --> 00:17:14.405
this new thing called "working."

201
00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:17.009
Oh, yeah. I don't believe
I'm familiar with the word.

202
00:17:17.143 --> 00:17:18.844
I don't believe you are.

203
00:17:18.978 --> 00:17:20.813
So, what's up with the goon squad?

204
00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:23.481
Oh, I won a hand of cards
against some Russian gentlemen.

205
00:17:23.615 --> 00:17:25.550
Apparently they found
his luck improbable.

206
00:17:25.683 --> 00:17:27.987
- There you are.
- More like impossible.

207
00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.222
So, doctor,
how is our favorite patient?

208
00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:33.259
Still determined to make
his short life even shorter?

209
00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:34.871
Yes, I am.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

210
00:17:34.994 --> 00:17:36.728
You look terrible.
Look at the state of you.

211
00:17:36.862 --> 00:17:39.832
Says the man wearing...
What is that, a quilt?

212
00:17:39.965 --> 00:17:42.634
Oh, sorry. I didn't get the memo
to dress for a funeral.

213
00:17:45.805 --> 00:17:48.808
Right. I will see you later.

214
00:17:48.941 --> 00:17:50.308
And you

215
00:17:50.441 --> 00:17:51.777
my door is always open.

216
00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:55.014
We miss you at Horizon.

217
00:17:55.147 --> 00:17:56.548
We could use your mind.

218
00:17:56.681 --> 00:18:00.351
- I'll leave you two to your fun.
- Bye, Nicholas.

219
00:18:00.485 --> 00:18:02.454
I have some good news.

220
00:18:02.588 --> 00:18:04.456
Let's go for a walk.

221
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.893
How's Martine doing these days?

222
00:18:07.027 --> 00:18:10.030
Dr. Bancroft?
She is, uh, overqualified,

223
00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:12.364
outperforming, brilliant as usual.

224
00:18:12.498 --> 00:18:14.301
And a royal pain in my ass.

225
00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:16.873
But she's keeping me honest for
the most part. Why do you ask?

226
00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:20.874
Eh, no reason. Just haven't
seen you in forever.

227
00:18:21.007 --> 00:18:23.076
I wondered if she had
something to do with it.

228
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.212
Aw, I miss you too.

229
00:18:25.344 --> 00:18:28.215
But, yes, she has been working
with me to save our lives.

230
00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:31.885
I could ask her to stop if you
like, put us out of our misery.

231
00:18:32.018 --> 00:18:34.720
Just don't do something stupid
and go and fall in love

232
00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:36.223
because, believe you me,

233
00:18:36.355 --> 00:18:38.524
there is absolutely no cure for that.

234
00:18:38.657 --> 00:18:40.327
Says the guy who knows
absolutely nothing

235
00:18:40.492 --> 00:18:41.732
- about the subject.
- Not true.

236
00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:43.395
I read about it
in books all the time.

237
00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:45.531
- Books, really? Wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:48.367
Or romantic comedies.
The point is...

239
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.072
The point is, love is not
on the cards for us, my friend.

240
00:18:52.205 --> 00:18:54.573
Listen, if you start quoting
<i>The Notebook</i> to me,

241
00:18:54.707 --> 00:18:56.843
I am going to stop
and hobble very slowly

242
00:18:56.977 --> 00:18:58.845
in the opposite direction.

243
00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:00.446
Throw it!

244
00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:02.082
I'm close, Milo.

245
00:19:03.217 --> 00:19:04.752
I can feel it.

246
00:19:06.686 --> 00:19:08.089
A cure.

247
00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:10.958
It's finally possible.

248
00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:16.429
- Seriously?
- Highly experimental.

249
00:19:16.563 --> 00:19:19.133
Ethically questionable.

250
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.904
Very, very, very expensive.

251
00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:27.141
- I knew that was coming.
- And not exactly legal.

252
00:19:27.275 --> 00:19:29.576
Oh, and it has to be done
in international waters.

253
00:19:31.812 --> 00:19:33.848
You were always expensive.

254
00:19:33.981 --> 00:19:37.952
Is it dangerous?
Should I be worried?

255
00:19:38.085 --> 00:19:40.687
- You want me to lie to you?
- That would be nice, yes.

256
00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:42.522
It's a walk in the park
on a sunny day.

257
00:19:42.656 --> 00:19:44.225
Oh, yeah, that bad, eh?

258
00:19:46.027 --> 00:19:47.194
Listen.

259
00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.697
We don't have much time left.

260
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.602
This could be our last chance.

261
00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:01.175
So, what do you say?

262
00:20:02.642 --> 00:20:04.980
We go out with a fight?

263
00:20:08.116 --> 00:20:09.284
Yeah.

264
00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:14.588
You with me?

265
00:20:14.722 --> 00:20:16.490
Till the day you die, brother.

266
00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:21.029
Till the day you die.
You'll have everything you need.

267
00:20:21.163 --> 00:20:23.531
We're the original Spartans, mate.

268
00:20:23.664 --> 00:20:27.336
- The few against the many.
- Yeah.

269
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:37.813
You know, I'm sure you're cheating.

270
00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.248
No. No, you're not.

271
00:20:40.382 --> 00:20:41.482
What you got?

272
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.651
Putting another one in the oven.

273
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.320
Wish me luck.

274
00:20:51.994 --> 00:20:54.129
The moment of truth.

275
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.350
Success, Martine. We did it.

276
00:21:14.484 --> 00:21:15.918
It's holding together.

277
00:21:17.186 --> 00:21:19.654
Test 243.

278
00:21:21.024 --> 00:21:23.159
Human trials.

279
00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:40.243
I'm glad it's you.

280
00:21:46.382 --> 00:21:48.151
Had a lot of other suitors,
didn't you?

281
00:21:48.284 --> 00:21:49.986
Yeah.

282
00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:51.888
You know, the whole near-death thing

283
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:54.390
is very, very chic.

284
00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:59.529
I read it in <i>Cosmo.</i>

285
00:21:59.661 --> 00:22:02.031
Do they still make <i>Cosmo?</i>
I don't know.

286
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.479
I know it's just
what you always wanted.

287
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:18.415
Could be a collector's item
one day, you never know.

288
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:21.785
This better not be my last one.

289
00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:24.154
I know this is painful,
but you got it.

290
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.761
- That's it. Bingo.
- Right there.

291
00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:37.134
Almost there, almost there.

292
00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:44.875
It's all right.
Come on. Come on.

293
00:22:45.008 --> 00:22:46.543
There you go.

294
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:57.788
You can buckle me up.

295
00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:00.090
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:23:00.224 --> 00:23:02.392
You all right? Great.

297
00:23:29.154 --> 00:23:30.321
I call.

298
00:23:31.856 --> 00:23:34.392
- Bringing out the big guns.
- Let's go again.

299
00:23:34.526 --> 00:23:36.461
I'll be back.
I'm gonna check on the doctor.

300
00:23:36.594 --> 00:23:37.762
All right.

301
00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:59.117
- You shouldn't be down here.
- I can be wherever I want, nurse.

302
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.052
It's "doctor," actually.

303
00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:04.721
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.

304
00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:08.426
Doctor. Sure, I can see it.

305
00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.264
But, uh, you're still the help,
just like me.

306
00:24:12.398 --> 00:24:13.999
Wow.

307
00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:16.902
You can tell all that
by just looking at me, huh?

308
00:24:17.036 --> 00:24:20.339
Here I thought you were just
another jacked-up dumb shit.

309
00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:23.741
Get out.

310
00:24:29.548 --> 00:24:32.084
Michael?

311
00:24:44.496 --> 00:24:46.599
- Michael?
- Where is he?

312
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:48.367
Don't move.

313
00:24:50.569 --> 00:24:52.071
What the hell?

314
00:24:52.204 --> 00:24:54.406
Everybody down to the lab now.

315
00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.342
Roger that.

316
00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:01.046
Don't shoot!

317
00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:11.790
Michael!

318
00:25:13.727 --> 00:25:15.295
Stop!

319
00:25:21.534 --> 00:25:22.636
Michael.

320
00:25:26.806 --> 00:25:28.341
It's just me.

321
00:25:28.475 --> 00:25:29.609
It's just me.

322
00:25:31.077 --> 00:25:32.279
Michael, please.

323
00:25:34.814 --> 00:25:36.416
Michael, stop!

324
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:39.853
Stop! Please!

325
00:25:39.986 --> 00:25:42.255
You're hurting yourself! Stop!

326
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:45.425
Hey! Step back! Move!

327
00:25:45.558 --> 00:25:48.561
- Stop. Put that gun down...
- Move!

328
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:10.850
Shit. Close it! Close it!

329
00:26:10.984 --> 00:26:12.419
What the hell is that thing?

330
00:26:29.036 --> 00:26:31.739
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Shit.

331
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:41.382
- Let's move.
- Go, go, go!

332
00:26:44.786 --> 00:26:47.188
Johnny!

333
00:26:51.292 --> 00:26:52.727
Get out of here!

334
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.065
<i>Sweeping Level 3.</i>

335
00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:00.802
Jason, come in.

336
00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:02.503
Jason. Jason?

337
00:27:07.608 --> 00:27:08.743
Oh, shit.

338
00:27:10.812 --> 00:27:12.413
Son of a bitch!

339
00:27:20.757 --> 00:27:22.624
Shit! Oh!

340
00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:23.892
Oh, shit!

341
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:09.867
Martine.

342
00:29:10.968 --> 00:29:12.368
Martine.

343
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.551
Oh, my God.

344
00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.181
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

345
00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:01.385
This is the <i>LCV Murnau.</i>

346
00:30:01.518 --> 00:30:04.187
Call letters 3-X5Y.

347
00:30:04.321 --> 00:30:07.324
<i>We are 13 nautical miles
off the coast of Long Island.</i>

348
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:10.193
<i>Request immediate airlift.</i>

349
00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:14.565
<i>Repeat, this is the</i> LCV Murnau.

00:30:14.698 --> 00:30:17.701
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

351
00:30:33.084 --> 00:30:35.921
It's up here to the right.

352
00:30:36.055 --> 00:30:40.391
FBI Agent Stroud.
Can we have the room, please?

353
00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:42.928
You heard the man.
Can we please have the room?

354
00:30:43.062 --> 00:30:45.496
If you could start exiting,
that'd be fantastic.

355
00:30:51.469 --> 00:30:53.304
Well, we haven't had
anything this good

356
00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:55.074
since that thing in San Francisco.

357
00:30:55.239 --> 00:30:57.141
Uh, eight bodies,
running IDs right now,

358
00:30:57.275 --> 00:31:01.379
but apparently they all shop at
the same mercenary supply store.

359
00:31:01.512 --> 00:31:04.616
Uh, one survivor,
a Dr. Martine Bancroft.

360
00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:06.819
- Can we talk to her?
- If she wakes up.

361
00:31:06.952 --> 00:31:09.487
Uh, she fell down
and hit her head, apparently.

362
00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:12.290
- Anything else?
- Someone made a mayday call.

363
00:31:12.423 --> 00:31:14.158
- Not Dr. Bancroft.
- Nope.

364
00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:16.494
It was a male,
didn't identify himself,

365
00:31:16.628 --> 00:31:18.396
then wiped
all the surveillance footage.

366
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:20.407
He grew a conscience
and jumped overboard?

367
00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:22.067
It happens. Oh, and get this.

368
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.303
All the bodies that you're looking at

369
00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:27.373
are nearly drained of their blood.

370
00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:30.944
So, what hunts at night
and drinks human blood?

371
00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:34.713
You're gonna love this.

372
00:31:34.848 --> 00:31:36.215
<i>Early this morning</i>

373
00:31:36.348 --> 00:31:37.951
<i>an unmanned cargo ship was discovered</i>

374
00:31:38.084 --> 00:31:39.953
<i>near the eastern tip of Long Island</i>

375
00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:41.620
<i>with multiple bodies on board.</i>

376
00:31:41.755 --> 00:31:44.791
<i>Authorities are not making
any comment at this time.</i>

377
00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:46.659
<i>But there are reports
of one survivor,</i>

378
00:31:46.793 --> 00:31:48.160
<i>and we have learned</i>

379
00:31:48.293 --> 00:31:49.863
<i>from a high-ranking Coast
Guard official</i>

380
00:31:49.996 --> 00:31:52.032
<i>that the vessel was flying
a Panamanian flag</i>

381
00:31:52.164 --> 00:31:54.801
<i>when it drifted in
from international...</i>

382
00:31:57.236 --> 00:31:58.604
What's happened?

383
00:32:00.172 --> 00:32:01.975
Some kind of accident.

384
00:32:04.677 --> 00:32:07.947
How's your pain today?
On a one to ten?

385
00:32:09.082 --> 00:32:10.449
Eleven.

386
00:32:46.386 --> 00:32:47.888
I'm sorry.

387
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:51.291
You're going to be okay.

388
00:33:04.138 --> 00:33:05.873
Lab 1.

389
00:33:06.006 --> 00:33:07.507
Privacy screens.

390
00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:27.461
Come on. Come on.

391
00:34:23.985 --> 00:34:25.619
As a result of my procedure,

392
00:34:25.753 --> 00:34:28.657
<i>I have an overpowering urge
to consume</i>

393
00:34:30.993 --> 00:34:32.494
<i>blood.</i>

394
00:34:32.627 --> 00:34:34.063
Human blood.

395
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.668
<i>In certain respects, I have succeeded</i>

396
00:34:39.802 --> 00:34:43.072
<i>far beyond anything
I could have imagined.</i>

397
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:47.176
<i>For the first time
in my entire life, I feel</i>

398
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:48.643
<i>good.</i>

399
00:34:48.777 --> 00:34:50.645
<i>Yesterday, I could barely walk.</i>

400
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.050
<i>Today, I don't know
what I'm capable of.</i>

401
00:35:06.695 --> 00:35:09.131
<i>For a period of time after ingestion,</i>

402
00:35:09.265 --> 00:35:10.665
my numbers are off the charts.

403
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.703
I have the constitution
of an Olympic athlete.

404
00:35:14.837 --> 00:35:16.806
<i>Increased strength and speed</i>

405
00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:18.841
<i>that can only be described as</i>

406
00:35:18.975 --> 00:35:20.343
<i>superhuman.</i>

407
00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:22.611
<i>And all of this</i>

408
00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:24.814
<i>on artificial blood.</i>

409
00:35:34.224 --> 00:35:37.727
<i>I've become something different.</i>

410
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:39.629
<i>I feel a kinship
with these creatures.</i>

411
00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:45.401
<i>They would tear anyone else
apart, but they welcome me.</i>

412
00:35:45.534 --> 00:35:47.204
<i>Like a brother.</i>

413
00:36:02.685 --> 00:36:07.423
<i>I've even developed
a form of echolocation.</i>

414
00:36:07.556 --> 00:36:10.060
<i>Bat radar, for the uninitiated.</i>

415
00:36:12.528 --> 00:36:14.630
<i>The question is:</i>

416
00:36:14.765 --> 00:36:16.632
<i>How do I control it?</i>

417
00:36:16.767 --> 00:36:18.368
Isolate it?

418
00:36:21.405 --> 00:36:22.538
Breathe.

419
00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:26.542
And let it go.

420
00:36:56.941 --> 00:37:00.378
<i>But, unfortunately,
this condition is temporary.</i>

421
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.017
<i>I've been timing myself.</i>

422
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:10.855
<i>Artificial blood keeps me
stable for six hours.</i>

423
00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:13.257
<i>But that window</i>

424
00:37:13.391 --> 00:37:15.259
<i>is growing shorter.</i>

425
00:37:15.393 --> 00:37:18.129
<i>Artificial blood won't work forever.</i>

426
00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:21.799
<i>One question remains:</i>

427
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.335
<i>What if...?</i>

428
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:27.972
<i>What if artificial blood
becomes ineffective?</i>

429
00:37:29.307 --> 00:37:31.541
<i>What happens if I go without?</i>

430
00:37:31.675 --> 00:37:33.379
<i>No blue...</i>

431
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:34.880
<i>No red...</i>

432
00:37:35.014 --> 00:37:36.148
<i>Nothing.</i>

433
00:37:40.019 --> 00:37:42.653
<i>Eventually, my vitals
drop precipitously</i>

434
00:37:42.788 --> 00:37:45.190
<i>and my illness returns
with a vengeance.</i>

435
00:37:46.892 --> 00:37:48.394
<i>Soon, I'll face a choice.</i>

436
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:52.064
<i>Drink the red,</i>

437
00:37:52.197 --> 00:37:53.766
<i>or die.</i>

438
00:37:53.899 --> 00:37:56.201
<i>But what happened on that ship</i>

439
00:37:56.335 --> 00:37:58.904
<i>can't ever happen again.</i>

440
00:38:27.232 --> 00:38:29.268
Michael.

441
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:30.836
It's me.

442
00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:32.104
You in here?

443
00:38:34.841 --> 00:38:36.342
Where are you?

444
00:38:41.247 --> 00:38:42.482
Michael?

445
00:38:42.648 --> 00:38:45.251
Michael? What are you doing?

446
00:38:46.685 --> 00:38:49.255
Michael, it's Milo.
What are you doing?

447
00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:52.125
Do you need help?

448
00:38:53.293 --> 00:38:54.828
What?

449
00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:03.103
"Blood."

450
00:39:04.603 --> 00:39:07.774
You want the blood
in the freezer? Wait.

451
00:39:10.076 --> 00:39:12.378
I'm coming, I'm coming.

452
00:39:12.512 --> 00:39:14.047
I'm coming.

453
00:39:22.122 --> 00:39:24.557
Michael, hang on.

454
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.826
Here. Here.

455
00:39:36.604 --> 00:39:38.139
Michael...

456
00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:52.019
You're... You're strong.

457
00:39:52.153 --> 00:39:53.854
Michael.

458
00:39:53.988 --> 00:39:56.056
You did it.

459
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.526
You did it.
You found a cure to live.

460
00:39:58.658 --> 00:39:59.894
Michael.

461
00:40:01.428 --> 00:40:03.030
What? What is it?

462
00:40:03.164 --> 00:40:05.499
I've made a terrible mistake, Milo.

463
00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:07.568
We all make mistakes.
Don't worry about it.

464
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.403
You've never made
one like this before.

465
00:40:09.537 --> 00:40:10.737
Michael, enough.

466
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:12.473
Just give it to me. I need it.

467
00:40:12.606 --> 00:40:14.707
I can't live like this
any longer. Please.

468
00:40:14.842 --> 00:40:17.211
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

469
00:40:18.745 --> 00:40:21.448
- I can't.
- I need this. I

470
00:40:21.582 --> 00:40:23.617
I've done things, Milo.

471
00:40:27.754 --> 00:40:29.290
I killed people.

472
00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:32.226
W-we... We can make that go away.

473
00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:35.629
The ones on the boat,
they're thugs, guns for hire.

474
00:40:35.763 --> 00:40:37.507
- I can make that go away.
- You don't understand.

475
00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:40.835
I do understand. Please.
Have I ever denied you anything?

476
00:40:40.969 --> 00:40:42.571
Said no?
Have I always given you...?

477
00:40:42.703 --> 00:40:44.806
I can't control it!

478
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:49.110
What, so... So you get to live
and I get to die? Is that it?

479
00:40:53.915 --> 00:40:55.050
It's a curse.

480
00:40:55.183 --> 00:40:58.286
Believe me, brother. It is.

481
00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:02.023
Now, please, I need you to go.

482
00:41:02.157 --> 00:41:03.757
- It's not safe here.
- No.

483
00:41:03.892 --> 00:41:07.529
No, don't make me go.
Please, Michael, don't

484
00:41:07.662 --> 00:41:09.264
I said, get out!

485
00:41:15.736 --> 00:41:17.505
I said, get out!

486
00:41:29.851 --> 00:41:31.353
Milo.

487
00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:38.393
She's right here.

488
00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.434
Dr. Bancroft?
Agents Stroud and Rodriguez.

489
00:41:46.702 --> 00:41:48.471
How you feeling, doctor?

490
00:41:48.604 --> 00:41:52.341
Like I'm in a hospital,
eating really crappy Jell-O.

491
00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:54.644
This shouldn't take long.

492
00:41:54.777 --> 00:41:56.312
You were out on a container ship

493
00:41:56.445 --> 00:41:59.015
that washed up off of Long Island.

494
00:41:59.148 --> 00:42:01.651
Doctor, there were
eight dead bodies inside.

495
00:42:01.784 --> 00:42:06.255
We also noticed that their blood
was... What do you call it?

496
00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:09.358
Exsanguinated. I looked it up.

497
00:42:09.492 --> 00:42:13.262
So, um, sorry for the graphic nature

498
00:42:13.396 --> 00:42:14.630
of some of these photos.

499
00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:16.332
But, um, you're a doctor,

500
00:42:16.465 --> 00:42:19.001
so you know what people
look like on the inside.

501
00:42:19.135 --> 00:42:22.138
These puncture wounds right there,

502
00:42:22.271 --> 00:42:24.440
those look like fang marks to you?

503
00:42:32.214 --> 00:42:35.685
Well, you were out there
conducting a major experiment.

504
00:42:35.818 --> 00:42:39.355
We're just hoping
you could shed some light.

505
00:42:39.488 --> 00:42:42.993
Yeah, that...
Not exactly sanitary, isn't it?

506
00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.041
I'm having a little bit
of a hard time

507
00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:48.198
remembering what happened that night.

508
00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.068
Sure. Let's go.

509
00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:58.842
You also work
at the Horizon Lab, right?

510
00:42:58.975 --> 00:43:01.478
With Dr. Michael Morbius.

511
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:02.746
Yes.

512
00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.517
Appreciate your time, doctor.

513
00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.157
Hello?

514
00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:58.469
Who's there?

515
00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.777
Hello?

516
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.683
<i>Get away from her.
Just step back.</i>

517
00:45:17.817 --> 00:45:19.685
<i>Has she been there all night?</i>

518
00:45:19.819 --> 00:45:23.222
<i>Looks like all the blood
was drained from her body.</i>

519
00:45:35.334 --> 00:45:38.437
- Any contusions?
- Not that I can see.

520
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.980
Back to our rooms, okay?

521
00:46:16.209 --> 00:46:17.577
Dr. Morbius?

522
00:46:18.678 --> 00:46:19.914
Agent Stroud.

523
00:46:20.046 --> 00:46:22.282
Agent Rodriguez.
Can we have a minute?

524
00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:24.852
Of course. How can I help you?

525
00:46:24.985 --> 00:46:26.954
First, I wanna say thank you.

526
00:46:27.086 --> 00:46:28.488
Your artificial blood

527
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:32.225
actually saved my arm
in Afghanistan, sir.

528
00:46:32.358 --> 00:46:34.093
I'm glad I could be of service.

529
00:46:34.227 --> 00:46:36.596
I mean, I must admit, doc,
you don't look

530
00:46:36.729 --> 00:46:38.899
anything like you do on the news.

531
00:46:39.033 --> 00:46:40.935
Yeah, you look downright robust.

532
00:46:41.067 --> 00:46:43.670
I have good days and bad.

533
00:46:43.804 --> 00:46:45.538
Pilates helps.

534
00:46:45.672 --> 00:46:47.507
How are you on boats?

535
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.077
As you can see

536
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:53.447
don't have very good sea legs.

537
00:46:54.648 --> 00:46:55.884
Why do you ask?

538
00:46:56.017 --> 00:46:57.551
'Cause you've been looking for a cure

539
00:46:57.685 --> 00:47:00.421
for your condition
your whole life, right?

540
00:47:00.554 --> 00:47:03.657
You've pretty much tried everything.

541
00:47:03.792 --> 00:47:07.461
Crazy experiments, maybe on a boat?

542
00:47:07.595 --> 00:47:11.165
"Crazy" isn't a term
that I would use

543
00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:12.466
detective.

544
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.302
Unorthodox, maybe.

545
00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:18.405
But I'd do just about anything
to save a life.

546
00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:21.076
I'm sure you can understand that.

547
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:24.311
Anything else I can
help you two with?

548
00:47:26.781 --> 00:47:29.426
<i>All
units, the 120 block, Horizon Labs,</i>

549
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.328
<i>female body drained of blood,
initiate lockdown.</i>

550
00:47:31.352 --> 00:47:36.590
Copy that. Doc, got
a couple more questions for you.

551
00:47:36.724 --> 00:47:39.460
Yeah, you're coming with us.

552
00:47:44.565 --> 00:47:45.733
Hey, freeze!

553
00:47:45.867 --> 00:47:47.002
Stop him!

554
00:47:49.404 --> 00:47:50.940
Hey!

555
00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:02.051
Hold fire!

556
00:48:02.183 --> 00:48:04.352
Get backup and meet me up top.

557
00:48:27.442 --> 00:48:28.978
Enough.

558
00:48:34.649 --> 00:48:36.952
<i>It's worse than I first thought.</i>

559
00:48:37.086 --> 00:48:39.454
<i>At this rate, artificial blood
will stop working</i>

560
00:48:39.587 --> 00:48:41.456
<i>in a matter of days.</i>

561
00:48:43.025 --> 00:48:45.393
8:13 p.m.

562
00:48:47.029 --> 00:48:52.635
Down from six hours
to four hours, 22 minutes.

563
00:48:56.039 --> 00:48:58.240
I got a problem.

564
00:49:18.227 --> 00:49:19.462
Holy water?

565
00:49:20.997 --> 00:49:23.200
- Really?
- What?

566
00:49:23.332 --> 00:49:25.802
I'm not taking any chances.

567
00:49:25.936 --> 00:49:27.403
It's triple blessed.

568
00:49:32.042 --> 00:49:34.978
We found this little guy
on the container ship

569
00:49:36.412 --> 00:49:38.048
with those bodies.

570
00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:42.185
That's a little hobby
of yours, right?

571
00:49:46.422 --> 00:49:49.458
You know,
eight dead mercs on a boat

572
00:49:49.592 --> 00:49:51.761
really doesn't ruffle our feathers.

573
00:49:51.895 --> 00:49:53.798
I'm pretty sure
they were guilty of something

574
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:55.699
and happy to have them off the water.

575
00:49:55.833 --> 00:50:01.605
But Nurse Sutton, single mother
with twin girls, that's

576
00:50:01.738 --> 00:50:05.308
- something else.
- Yes, I know.

577
00:50:05.442 --> 00:50:07.310
Her name was Kristen.
We worked together

578
00:50:07.444 --> 00:50:09.579
every single day for seven years.

579
00:50:10.647 --> 00:50:12.482
She was a good person.

580
00:50:12.616 --> 00:50:14.484
So why'd you do it?

581
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:20.191
I can't answer that.

582
00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:30.534
What did you do to yourself, doctor?

583
00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:34.337
- Make us understand.
- I wish I knew.

584
00:50:38.976 --> 00:50:40.443
Okay.

585
00:50:40.577 --> 00:50:43.346
Great stuff.
Um, Really informative.

586
00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.349
- Thank you. Uh...
- I dropped a bag.

587
00:50:46.483 --> 00:50:48.351
There's something inside that I need.

588
00:50:48.485 --> 00:50:50.587
- Bag of artificial blood.
- Yeah.

589
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.124
Yeah. It's in evidence,
I'm sorry.

590
00:50:58.763 --> 00:51:00.032
I'm sorry.

591
00:51:01.666 --> 00:51:03.467
I'm starting to get hungry.

592
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.438
And you don't wanna see me
when I'm hungry.

593
00:51:11.844 --> 00:51:14.012
We're done here. Let's go.

594
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.917
Guard!

595
00:51:21.552 --> 00:51:23.155
Your lawyer's here.

596
00:51:36.335 --> 00:51:37.535
You look terrible.

597
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:42.573
Lawyer, huh?

598
00:51:42.707 --> 00:51:45.043
I don't remember
you ever finishing law school.

599
00:51:45.177 --> 00:51:46.845
'Cause I didn't.

600
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.149
Sit down. Sit down.

601
00:51:55.287 --> 00:51:57.689
I mean, if one of us
was going to end up

602
00:51:57.824 --> 00:51:59.591
in bright orange trainers,

603
00:51:59.725 --> 00:52:02.262
I would never have guessed
it would be you.

604
00:52:05.064 --> 00:52:07.166
They're charging me with murder.

605
00:52:09.401 --> 00:52:12.038
I don't know. I don't know.

606
00:52:13.239 --> 00:52:14.774
I...

607
00:52:14.908 --> 00:52:16.943
Maybe I blacked out? Uh...

608
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:20.246
Hey.

609
00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.915
Now listen to me.

610
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:25.785
I don't believe it.

611
00:52:25.919 --> 00:52:28.087
You're not capable of that.

612
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:32.792
I know that all you've ever
tried to do is help people.

613
00:52:32.926 --> 00:52:34.394
You don't belong here.

614
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:35.727
This place is for terrorists

615
00:52:35.862 --> 00:52:37.763
and drugs lords and God knows who.

616
00:52:37.897 --> 00:52:41.401
Michael, we need
to get you out of here.

617
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.869
In whatever way possible.

618
00:52:43.002 --> 00:52:44.938
Maybe this is where I belong.

619
00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:47.706
If I'm in here,
then nobody else dies.

620
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.075
Listen to me.

621
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:52.078
You are not capable
of killing that woman.

622
00:52:53.612 --> 00:52:55.882
Hey, Your Highness, time's up.

623
00:52:57.383 --> 00:52:59.719
Michael, here's something
to keep you going.

624
00:53:01.688 --> 00:53:03.324
Guard.

625
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.186
Never too early.

626
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.936
Milo.

627
00:54:06.754 --> 00:54:07.889
Milo!

628
00:54:36.384 --> 00:54:37.895
Let's move!

629
00:54:37.919 --> 00:54:40.088
Come on, this way!

630
00:54:48.797 --> 00:54:50.432
Let's go. Let's go.

631
00:54:50.564 --> 00:54:51.800
Open the door.

632
00:54:51.933 --> 00:54:53.868
Now! Go!

633
00:54:54.002 --> 00:54:55.736
He's getting away!

634
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.296
<i>Daily Bugle,</i> please, sir.

635
00:55:20.429 --> 00:55:24.066
- There you go, buddy.
- Here you are, my friend.

636
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.169
Always figured that guy for a freak.

637
00:55:27.303 --> 00:55:29.271
How's that?
You've never met him.

638
00:55:29.405 --> 00:55:32.007
I mean, look at him.
What else you need to know?

639
00:55:32.141 --> 00:55:35.311
<i>You know, you shouldn't
judge someone by how they look.</i>

640
00:55:35.444 --> 00:55:37.980
<i>Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?</i>

641
00:55:38.114 --> 00:55:40.082
<i>Take me, for example.</i>

642
00:55:40.216 --> 00:55:42.585
<i>I may look harmless enough.</i>

643
00:55:42.717 --> 00:55:44.987
Do you think I'm joking?

644
00:56:03.807 --> 00:56:04.975
Milo!

645
00:56:06.775 --> 00:56:08.011
Got me.

646
00:56:08.145 --> 00:56:10.514
You see? I knew you could do it.

647
00:56:10.646 --> 00:56:13.350
You took the serum
even after I warned you.

648
00:56:13.483 --> 00:56:15.118
What am I gonna do, lay down and die?

649
00:56:15.252 --> 00:56:17.821
- Thank you for the death wish.
- I tried to protect you!

650
00:56:17.954 --> 00:56:19.789
Protect me?
Protect me from what?

651
00:56:19.923 --> 00:56:21.224
Becoming a monster like me.

652
00:56:21.358 --> 00:56:23.960
I don't think you're a monster.
Okay?

653
00:56:24.094 --> 00:56:25.661
I killed the nurse.

654
00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:27.330
I killed the nurse.

655
00:56:27.464 --> 00:56:30.333
I know. But you know
what it's like your first time.

656
00:56:30.467 --> 00:56:34.037
You have no idea what you're
doing. You have no control.

657
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:35.372
No.

658
00:56:37.773 --> 00:56:39.643
Milo, you have to stop.

659
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:43.079
You have to stop. You have
to stop denying who you are.

660
00:56:43.213 --> 00:56:46.416
It's boring. We can go anywhere,
we can do anything. Let's go.

661
00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.185
Let's have some fun.

662
00:56:48.318 --> 00:56:49.920
This isn't you.

663
00:56:51.687 --> 00:56:54.991
I know you. Where's the brother
that I used to have?

664
00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:57.127
How can you say that to me?

665
00:56:58.195 --> 00:57:00.130
Look what you've become.

666
00:57:00.263 --> 00:57:02.065
Everything I am, I am because of you.

667
00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:04.367
I looked up to you my whole life.

668
00:57:04.502 --> 00:57:07.872
I will never leave you,
and I will not go back.

669
00:57:08.005 --> 00:57:11.642
You cannot make me go back.
I won't let you make me go back!

670
00:57:27.558 --> 00:57:29.427
Move, bitch, move!

671
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:43.207
- Goodness.
- Whoo!

672
00:57:44.442 --> 00:57:46.143
We've evolved!

673
00:57:47.378 --> 00:57:48.813
You're a scientist, Michael.

674
00:57:48.946 --> 00:57:51.782
Surely, surely you understand that.

675
00:57:51.916 --> 00:57:54.619
That's not what this is.
This is a mistake.

676
00:57:54.751 --> 00:57:57.955
But I can fix it. I'll figure
out how to reverse it.

677
00:57:58.089 --> 00:58:00.458
Artificial blood will keep us
stable until I do.

678
00:58:00.591 --> 00:58:03.760
Yeah, I'm fine just the way
I am, thank you very much.

679
00:58:03.894 --> 00:58:05.963
Hey! Hands up!

680
00:58:06.097 --> 00:58:08.300
- Up against the wall. Now.
- Officer.

681
00:58:08.433 --> 00:58:09.968
- Come on.
- Anything you say.

682
00:58:10.102 --> 00:58:12.037
- You. Don't move.
- Okey-do key.

683
00:58:14.339 --> 00:58:16.441
We have the suspects.

684
00:58:16.575 --> 00:58:18.443
Like we used to say

685
00:58:18.577 --> 00:58:19.745
live a little.

686
00:58:24.616 --> 00:58:25.751
Hey!

687
00:58:25.884 --> 00:58:27.019
Freeze!

688
00:58:38.163 --> 00:58:42.334
All our lives, we've lived
with death hanging over us.

689
00:58:42.467 --> 00:58:44.002
Why?

690
00:58:44.136 --> 00:58:46.238
Why shouldn't they know
what it feels like

691
00:58:46.371 --> 00:58:49.975
for a change, Michael?

692
00:58:50.108 --> 00:58:53.645
Michael!

693
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.981
Michael.

694
00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:14.300
I'm not gonna fight you, Milo.

695
01:00:28.909 --> 01:00:31.779
Now he's laying out
officers in my city, huh?

696
01:00:32.913 --> 01:00:34.481
It's unforgiveable.

697
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.621
Just keep your eyes
on Dr. Bancroft.

698
01:00:40.754 --> 01:00:42.156
Yeah.

699
01:01:36.978 --> 01:01:39.547
Woman in the jeans, where'd she go?

700
01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:41.316
Yeah, right.

701
01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:48.824
Great.

702
01:02:02.437 --> 01:02:04.272
Hey, stranger.

703
01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:07.609
Michael?

704
01:02:11.446 --> 01:02:13.449
You shouldn't be here.

705
01:02:13.582 --> 01:02:17.286
I didn't kill Nurse Sutton
or the police.

706
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.890
Or any of those people.

707
01:02:21.757 --> 01:02:23.125
I know.

708
01:02:23.259 --> 01:02:24.493
Milo, he...

709
01:02:24.627 --> 01:02:27.663
He took the serum.

710
01:02:27.797 --> 01:02:29.698
He's out there.

711
01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:31.700
And I have to stop him.

712
01:02:34.203 --> 01:02:35.604
But I need your help.

713
01:02:42.077 --> 01:02:43.579
Coffee?

714
01:02:43.712 --> 01:02:46.282
- No, thanks. I quit caffeine.
- It's decaf.

715
01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:58.761
Not that kind of vampire.

716
01:02:58.895 --> 01:03:00.429
Just checking.

717
01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:04.099
I shouldn't have dragged you
out there. I'm sorry.

718
01:03:04.233 --> 01:03:06.235
You didn't.

719
01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:07.837
I wanted to be there.

720
01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:10.439
Well, then apology rescinded.

721
01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:12.274
I guess we're both a little crazy.

722
01:03:12.408 --> 01:03:13.742
How do you feel?

723
01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.178
Incredible.

724
01:03:15.312 --> 01:03:17.247
I mean, I went from dying
my entire life

725
01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:19.349
to feeling more alive than ever.

726
01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:22.185
Thankfully, artificial blood
keeps me stable.

727
01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:24.421
I just have to drink it more often.

728
01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:26.057
- How often?
- Uh...

729
01:03:26.189 --> 01:03:29.526
Every four hours, 22 minutes.
Down from six.

730
01:03:29.659 --> 01:03:31.796
It's losing its effectiveness.

731
01:03:31.929 --> 01:03:35.398
The issue is,
when it stops working.

732
01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:39.336
I'll become like Milo.

733
01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:42.606
You won't.

734
01:03:44.374 --> 01:03:46.343
Hi. Over there.

735
01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:53.851
Sorry, this one's no good.

736
01:03:53.985 --> 01:03:56.419
Check it again.
And keep one for yourself.

737
01:03:56.553 --> 01:03:58.421
No, I don't wanna do it.

738
01:03:58.555 --> 01:04:00.195
There's plenty more
where those came from.

739
01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.359
Come on, man,
we gotta get back to the lab.

740
01:04:09.532 --> 01:04:10.667
Michael?

741
01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:12.402
Okay, I know that look.

742
01:04:12.535 --> 01:04:14.437
You're up to something.
What is it?

743
01:04:14.571 --> 01:04:16.407
I'll need a couple of things
from the lab.

744
01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.076
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes, I can.

745
01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:20.112
But you didn't answer
my question. What is it?

746
01:04:20.244 --> 01:04:22.513
You're right.
I'm up to something.

747
01:04:30.989 --> 01:04:34.126
- You got the blood?
- Got it.

748
01:05:05.023 --> 01:05:07.025
<i>The ink on this
new batch is pretty legit.</i>

749
01:05:07.159 --> 01:05:09.493
<i>It's a good thing
we switched the chemicals.</i>

750
01:05:09.627 --> 01:05:10.996
<i>Yo, finish up.</i>

751
01:05:44.563 --> 01:05:47.432
It's a nice place that you got here.

752
01:05:47.566 --> 01:05:49.735
Oh, I love this movie.
Is this the part

753
01:05:49.869 --> 01:05:51.746
where the mysterious guy
with the hoodie comes in

754
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:53.570
and kicks everybody's asses?
I love that part.

755
01:05:54.907 --> 01:05:56.627
- Who the hell are you?
- It doesn't matter,

756
01:05:56.742 --> 01:05:59.311
but I am gonna need your laboratory.

757
01:05:59.444 --> 01:06:01.364
You can keep the money,

758
01:06:01.413 --> 01:06:02.614
all your little toys.

759
01:06:02.748 --> 01:06:04.449
Just leave the science-y stuff

760
01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.053
and that bag of spicy Cheetos.

761
01:06:07.186 --> 01:06:08.888
- He wants my lab?
- Yeah.

762
01:06:09.021 --> 01:06:11.991
You trying to be funny?

763
01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:15.027
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
That's their job.

764
01:06:15.161 --> 01:06:17.230
I mean, look
at their matching necklaces.

765
01:06:17.362 --> 01:06:18.798
Time to go.

766
01:06:20.934 --> 01:06:23.736
Did you know that there are
27 bones in the human hand?

767
01:06:23.871 --> 01:06:25.038
Allow me

768
01:06:25.172 --> 01:06:27.440
to introduce the phalanges.

769
01:06:27.573 --> 01:06:28.942
The metacarpals.

770
01:06:29.076 --> 01:06:30.516
Shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

771
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.213
And the pretty, little stinky pinkie.

772
01:06:36.415 --> 01:06:38.551
- Who the hell are you, man?
- Me?

773
01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:42.321
I am Venom.

774
01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:46.526
You can go now.

775
01:06:49.096 --> 01:06:52.800
Six to eight weeks,
a little ibuprofen.

776
01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:55.301
Should heal up just fine.

777
01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:23.325
Yo. Can I get a tequila, please?

778
01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:24.859
Don Julio 1942.

779
01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:37.171
Do I know you?

780
01:08:37.305 --> 01:08:38.506
Me?

781
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.010
- Yeah.
- No, I don't think so.

782
01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.745
We've met.

783
01:08:43.879 --> 01:08:46.115
- I'm sure of it.
- No, I'd remember.

784
01:08:47.316 --> 01:08:49.051
You're too pretty.

785
01:08:49.184 --> 01:08:52.654
You know what they say, "Tequila
to remember, whiskey to forget."

786
01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:55.423
That's good.

787
01:08:55.555 --> 01:08:57.292
Sir, two tequilas, please.

788
01:09:00.362 --> 01:09:01.997
Hey, yo.

789
01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.935
Her drinks are spoken for, bro.

790
01:09:06.068 --> 01:09:08.136
<i>Salute.</i>

791
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:11.738
You know, uh, ahem,
I'm gonna do you a favor

792
01:09:11.874 --> 01:09:14.009
and let you walk out of here,
all right?

793
01:09:14.143 --> 01:09:15.443
That's very kind of you.

794
01:09:15.576 --> 01:09:17.745
Here was I thinking
you were a complete asshole.

795
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.580
- Sir, can I get my friend here...
- Relax.

796
01:09:19.714 --> 01:09:22.952
And his friends
a round of whiskeys?

797
01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:27.256
Hey!

798
01:09:33.897 --> 01:09:35.497
I'll get you another drink.

799
01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:38.134
Hey.

800
01:09:40.236 --> 01:09:41.404
Another time.

801
01:09:44.473 --> 01:09:45.640
Jerk.

802
01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:51.214
You see the size of that guy?
I'm not paying for those drinks.

803
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.882
Martine.

804
01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:30.388
Milo.

805
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.721
Sorry. I let myself in.

806
01:10:31.856 --> 01:10:34.225
I hope I didn't startle you.

807
01:10:34.358 --> 01:10:36.060
It's okay.

808
01:10:36.193 --> 01:10:37.838
If I'd known
our biggest funder was coming,

809
01:10:37.862 --> 01:10:41.132
I would have planned
a nice dinner for us.

810
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.803
Actually, I've already eaten.

811
01:10:49.173 --> 01:10:51.842
Whatever it is, it's doing
wonders for your health.

812
01:10:55.212 --> 01:10:56.947
I feel great.

813
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.417
- What can I do for you?
- Well, it's Michael.

814
01:10:59.549 --> 01:11:00.784
I'm worried about him.

815
01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:03.187
He's alone out there.

816
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.556
And I think he needs me.

817
01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:09.927
If I can get to him before
the police do, I can help him.

818
01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:12.963
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

819
01:11:13.097 --> 01:11:16.300
You two have always been so close.

820
01:11:16.434 --> 01:11:18.135
I'm sorry.

821
01:11:19.904 --> 01:11:21.072
I don't.

822
01:11:24.574 --> 01:11:26.676
Hmm.

823
01:11:29.848 --> 01:11:31.049
Just to be sure,

824
01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:33.351
I'm going to ask you one more time.

825
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.557
You don't happen to know
where he is, do you, Martine?

826
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:40.525
I wouldn't lie to you, Milo.

827
01:11:43.661 --> 01:11:44.796
I don't.

828
01:11:49.534 --> 01:11:52.137
Now, if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

829
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:53.905
Okay.

830
01:11:54.039 --> 01:11:56.842
Well, if you see him,
if you hear from him, tell him:

831
01:11:56.975 --> 01:11:59.978
"We are the few
against the many."

832
01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:04.082
We'll have to do that dinner
another time, Martine.

833
01:12:30.543 --> 01:12:32.011
Police!

834
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.188
Clear!

835
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.324
Clear!

836
01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:57.003
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

837
01:13:03.309 --> 01:13:07.246
Cat's gone. And she's
probably gone along with it.

838
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:13.252
It's time to eat, you little monster.

839
01:13:13.386 --> 01:13:14.520
Oh!

840
01:13:16.556 --> 01:13:17.857
Shit.

841
01:13:24.797 --> 01:13:26.866
Michael?

842
01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.069
Hey.

843
01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:32.806
Michael.

844
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.641
I'm sorry.

845
01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.214
You may wanna close that up.

846
01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:41.515
Yep.

847
01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:53.093
How does it feel

848
01:13:53.227 --> 01:13:55.095
when you're on red?

849
01:13:57.231 --> 01:14:00.167
Something wakes up
inside of me, something

850
01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:03.971
primal.

851
01:14:06.707 --> 01:14:08.375
And it just, uh...

852
01:14:11.578 --> 01:14:13.380
And it wants to hunt.

853
01:14:15.549 --> 01:14:17.317
And wants to kill.

854
01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:24.958
I'm sorry.

855
01:14:56.724 --> 01:14:58.092
Hi.

856
01:15:01.062 --> 01:15:02.263
Good as new.

857
01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.866
Nice work, doctor.

858
01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:07.035
Thank you, doctor.

859
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:11.673
You know, for the record, I

860
01:15:11.806 --> 01:15:15.643
I wasn't gonna go
full Dracula on you downstairs.

861
01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.545
For the record

862
01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.648
I find him to be quite the romantic.

863
01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.717
Come here.

864
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:24.719
Just close your eyes.

865
01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.555
Okay.

866
01:15:29.123 --> 01:15:30.558
Move closer.

867
01:15:57.086 --> 01:16:00.222
Did you know the average male
body has 12 pints of blood?

868
01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:03.225
I mean, how much do you think
the doctor can drink?

869
01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:04.660
I don't know.

870
01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.695
When's the last time
you had 36 beers?

871
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:09.598
When's the last time
you had any beers?

872
01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:15.904
CCTV.

873
01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.740
I'll go grab the footage.

874
01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.442
I don't want you
to have to move or anything.

875
01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.448
All right, check this out.

876
01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:35.023
Wait, wait, wait.

877
01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:38.495
Zoom in. And hold right there.

878
01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:42.565
That's not the doctor.

879
01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.435
It's what these
bloodsuckers do. They multiply.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:36.821
I mean, look at me.

898
01:17:39.123 --> 01:17:41.325
I am reborn.

899
01:17:41.459 --> 01:17:43.661
I am the resurrection.

900
01:17:45.062 --> 01:17:47.498
My God, what have you done
to yourself?

901
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:49.667
What?

902
01:17:49.801 --> 01:17:51.702
Do you disapprove?

903
01:17:51.837 --> 01:17:55.206
What's the matter, Nicholas?
Is Daddy cross?

904
01:17:55.339 --> 01:17:57.107
All right. Settle down.

905
01:17:57.241 --> 01:17:58.877
Let's go and have a drink together.

906
01:17:59.009 --> 01:18:00.277
Come celebrate with me, please.

907
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:01.679
- No.
- Just one drink.

908
01:18:01.813 --> 01:18:04.816
Milo, you're scaring me.
Please. Just...

909
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.518
Just... Just calm down.

910
01:18:16.895 --> 01:18:20.598
- What's the matter?
- I can't... I can't sleep.

911
01:18:20.731 --> 01:18:23.667
I can help you with that.

912
01:18:23.802 --> 01:18:27.538
I've been more than a friend
to you all this time, Milo.

913
01:18:27.671 --> 01:18:30.207
And I'm going to stay here with you.

914
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:35.513
But there will be
no more violence, understand?

915
01:18:37.681 --> 01:18:39.617
That doesn't do it for me.

916
01:18:41.486 --> 01:18:44.222
I should have known.
You always take his side.

917
01:18:44.356 --> 01:18:46.691
Tell me your side, then, Milo.

918
01:18:46.826 --> 01:18:49.160
Michael doesn't accept
what he is, Nicholas.

919
01:18:49.294 --> 01:18:50.729
I'm gonna make him accept it.

920
01:18:50.863 --> 01:18:55.033
- By ruining his good name?
- See? There! There you are!

921
01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:59.037
Perfect Michael, selfless
Michael, Michael the favorite!

922
01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:00.739
Don't be childish, Milo!

923
01:19:00.873 --> 01:19:02.918
If anyone has a claim
to being my favorite, it's you.

924
01:19:02.942 --> 01:19:05.477
- I've devoted my life to you.
- Liar.

925
01:19:08.981 --> 01:19:10.715
You pitied me before.

926
01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:16.087
You did. You pitied me before.
You're repulsed by me now.

927
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:18.757
I am repulsed

928
01:19:18.891 --> 01:19:20.792
by what you've done,

929
01:19:20.927 --> 01:19:22.895
by what you've become.

930
01:19:26.398 --> 01:19:30.368
Whatever this thing is

931
01:19:30.502 --> 01:19:33.071
you're not up to it.

932
01:19:33.204 --> 01:19:35.574
There's no shame in what we are.

933
01:19:39.077 --> 01:19:41.379
"We are the few..."

934
01:19:43.016 --> 01:19:45.551
"Against the many."

935
01:19:51.257 --> 01:19:53.125
Tell Michael,

936
01:19:53.259 --> 01:19:55.179
you tell him I'm going to kill
as many as I want.

937
01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:10.676
"He's only destroyed
by a stake through the heart,

938
01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:14.081
made from the wood
of the Holy Cross."

939
01:20:14.213 --> 01:20:16.148
You don't believe this.

940
01:20:16.282 --> 01:20:20.753
No. But after the week
that I've had, anything is possible.

941
01:20:21.922 --> 01:20:23.056
What is that?

942
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:27.159
This is an antibody.

943
01:20:27.293 --> 01:20:31.631
It inhibits ferritin,
induces a massive iron overload,

944
01:20:31.764 --> 01:20:33.733
instant hemochromatosis.

945
01:20:35.102 --> 01:20:38.137
Deadly to bats, fatal to humans.

946
01:20:39.238 --> 01:20:40.907
Okay.

947
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:42.843
Who's the second one for?

948
01:20:46.647 --> 01:20:49.583
My window's closing.
We both know that.

949
01:20:49.716 --> 01:20:51.919
By tomorrow I'll be forced
to consume human blood.

950
01:20:52.053 --> 01:20:53.487
I can't do that.
I won't do that.

951
01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.422
So this is your solution, huh?

952
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:58.458
Injecting yourself with poison?

953
01:20:58.592 --> 01:21:00.928
I brought this into the world.

954
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.099
It's up to me to take it out.

955
01:21:09.336 --> 01:21:13.774
I need you to go now.
It's not safe here. Okay?

956
01:21:28.455 --> 01:21:30.724
Nicholas, you okay?

957
01:21:30.858 --> 01:21:33.694
<i>Michael, I need help.</i>

958
01:21:35.863 --> 01:21:38.765
<i>I went to see Milo.</i>

959
01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.069
Nicholas?

960
01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:42.870
Nicholas!

961
01:22:06.394 --> 01:22:07.930
Nicholas.

962
01:22:10.899 --> 01:22:12.101
Nicholas?

963
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.637
- Michael.
- Come on,

964
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:19.007
we have to get you to a hospital.

965
01:22:21.509 --> 01:22:25.047
You have to stop him.

966
01:22:43.731 --> 01:22:45.200
<i>Michael.</i>

967
01:22:46.602 --> 01:22:48.771
<i>Michael.</i>

968
01:22:48.905 --> 01:22:50.606
Call out for him.

969
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:53.943
I want him to hear you.

970
01:22:54.077 --> 01:22:55.912
- No.
- Yeah.

971
01:22:56.045 --> 01:22:59.149
<i>I won't ask you again.</i>

972
01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:02.152
<i>Say, "Michael."</i>

973
01:23:03.619 --> 01:23:05.054
<i>Michael.</i>

974
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:08.590
<i>Good girl.</i>

975
01:23:10.126 --> 01:23:11.828
<i>Michael.</i>

976
01:23:14.264 --> 01:23:17.100
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah.</i>

977
01:23:22.738 --> 01:23:24.473
<i>Michael.</i>

978
01:23:27.476 --> 01:23:28.978
<i>Milo.</i>

979
01:23:30.445 --> 01:23:32.849
You're hurting me.

980
01:23:32.982 --> 01:23:34.516
It's okay.

981
01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:15.425
Martine?

982
01:24:16.827 --> 01:24:19.830
Let me take a look. Martine.

983
01:24:19.964 --> 01:24:21.899
- Let me look.
- It's bad.

984
01:24:23.766 --> 01:24:25.302
Michael.

985
01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:27.004
Make it mean something.

986
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:30.074
I can help you.

987
01:24:36.046 --> 01:24:37.314
I'm sorry.

988
01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:38.810
Drank the red.

989
01:25:39.911 --> 01:25:41.179
Good for you.

990
01:25:42.713 --> 01:25:44.983
It's just you and me, Michael!

991
01:25:45.116 --> 01:25:47.685
Nothing, no one, to hold us back.

992
01:25:47.819 --> 01:25:50.654
I'm all you have left.

993
01:25:50.788 --> 01:25:54.327
That's the spirit. Yeah.

994
01:26:57.424 --> 01:26:58.825
Bye.

995
01:27:37.998 --> 01:27:40.599
Come on, Michael!

996
01:27:40.733 --> 01:27:42.668
Come on!

997
01:27:42.802 --> 01:27:45.906
You can do better than this!

998
01:27:46.039 --> 01:27:48.108
It's not a curse.

999
01:27:48.241 --> 01:27:49.543
It's a gift.

1000
01:27:49.675 --> 01:27:51.610
You started this, you created this,

1001
01:27:51.744 --> 01:27:53.579
you created us!

1002
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.578
Michael.

1003
01:30:35.712 --> 01:30:37.280
You can't kill me.

1004
01:30:39.415 --> 01:30:41.351
I mean, it's me.

1005
01:30:43.186 --> 01:30:45.021
You can't kill me.

1006
01:30:56.765 --> 01:30:58.534
You gave me my name.

1007
01:31:00.104 --> 01:31:01.705
Remember?

1008
01:31:03.607 --> 01:31:05.376
I remember everything.

1009
01:31:08.112 --> 01:31:09.446
I'm sorry.

1010
01:31:28.532 --> 01:31:29.967
Lucian.

1011
01:32:08.673 --> 01:32:11.743
- Stay back, people.
- Get back! Back!

1012
01:34:31.953 --> 01:34:34.856
Hope the food's better in this joint.

1013
01:34:34.988 --> 01:34:37.123
<i>The bizarre story developing</i>

1014
01:34:37.257 --> 01:34:39.059
<i>at the Manhattan Detention Center</i>

1015
01:34:39.192 --> 01:34:42.462
<i>when a man identifying himself
as Adrian Toomes</i>

1016
01:34:42.596 --> 01:34:45.867
<i>simply appeared
in an otherwise empty cell.</i>

1017
01:34:45.999 --> 01:34:47.634
<i>A hearing has been set</i>

1018
01:34:47.767 --> 01:34:51.271
<i>that could likely lead

1019
01:37:01.637 --> 01:37:04.007
Thanks for meeting me, doc.

1020
01:37:04.139 --> 01:37:05.741
I've been reading about you.

1021
01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:08.777
- I'm listening.
- I'm not sure how I got here.

1022
01:37:08.911 --> 01:37:11.849
Has to do with Spider-Man, I think.

1023
01:37:11.982 --> 01:37:13.816
I'm still figuring this place out,

1024
01:37:13.951 --> 01:37:17.121
but I think a bunch of guys
like us should team up.

1025
01:37:17.253 --> 01:37:19.188
Could do some good.

1026
01:37:19.322 --> 01:37:20.590
Intriguing.
