1
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:48.083
Dammit.

2
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.291
Don't shoot.

3
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.958
Emergency, gentlemen. Jeez.

4
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.041
Go! Go MK!

5
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:57.875
Where are you going now?

6
00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.708
No way…

7
00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:14.583
Homeless.

8
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.333
Take this street!

9
00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:19.166
Piss off! I'll kill you!

10
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:21.125
What now?

11
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
-Let's go!
-He's trying to kill us. Move!

12
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.125
You're driving right past it!

13
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.166
Reverse.

14
00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.208
Go in, brother!

15
00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:15.125
-Go, Masego! Let's move.
-Masego, no way man!

16
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.166
Comrades, get moving.
We need to find a way out.

17
00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:05.500
Masego! Wake up!
What do you think you're doing?

18
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.875
Masego, don't do this to me!

19
00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.208
Masego, I'm begging you.

20
00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:23.833
Hurry up, you must go.

21
00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:25.291
Quickly, go.

22
00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.250
Fuck you!

23
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.416
Terra! We need to move!

24
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.291
I think it's Pieter!

25
00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.375
Pieter, are you okay?

26
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.333
Hold on, buddy, hold on.

27
00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.208
Hold on, they are on their way.

28
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.291
Men, search the whole building.

29
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.708
Go up there! Every car as well.

30
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.875
Let's get out of here!

31
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.583
Press, Aldo, press!

32
00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.458
Get out of the way!

33
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:50.833
-Let's go, guys!
-Go!

34
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:07.083
Let's go!

35
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.625
Go past!

36
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:20.583
Keep going!

37
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:09.958
Rabbi, get down! Down!

38
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.375
Move, clear!

39
00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.041
Go past!

40
00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:46.625
What kind of shit is this?

41
00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.000
Hurry, Ma. Go!

42
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:53.875
Gents, what are we gonna do?

43
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.916
What do you think you're doing, boy?

44
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.500
You didn't say he's Black.

45
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:57.375
Johan, let him go. Johan.

46
00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:31.166
Hold fast!

47
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.250
Hold fast!

48
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.625
What's this? Hello.

49
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.750
Looks like this one has issues.

50
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:40.750
Sit down! Don't get on my nerves.

51
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:45.083
Ladies too. Let's go.

52
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.041
I know.

53
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.916
How's he know our names?

54
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.541
Never mind our names.
How did he know about the mission?

55
00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:44.791
-Maybe the truck driver?
-No. All the truck driver knew

56
00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:47.458
was to meet us there
and drive us in. That's it.

57
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.125
This guy knew everything.

58
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.708
Don't look at me.

59
00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.250
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.

60
00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:09.666
There were other units
where we left Masego.

61
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:44.916
I'm Captain Langerman.
South African Police.

62
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.875
We met outside the bank.

63
00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.208
Let's go.

64
00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:32.916
Shoot!

65
00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:37.708
-Shoot!
-Get up!

66
00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:44.458
Shoot!

67
00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:49.291
Come out of there,
you dog. Come out!

68
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.750
Come on, dog. Move.

69
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:02.541
-Why aren't you shooting?
-Do not fire.

70
00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:10.833
Move. Move, dog.

71
00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.333
Sit down!

72
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:38.416
We've lost the signal.

73
00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:50.125
You're a piece of crap.

74
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.375
This dog nearly had us killed.

75
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.625
Please…

76
00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:45.125
Come here.

77
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:51.500
And now?

78
00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:52.416
Get in…

79
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.500
Let's go.

80
00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.666
Let's go.

81
00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:00.750
Get in.

82
00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:01.708
Get in!

83
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:13.541
Get up.

84
00:32:27.083 --> 00:32:28.333
Talk!

85
00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:29.625
-I don't know.
-Lies!

86
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:46.375
Go cool off.

87
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.416
The Little Crocodile is here.

88
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.291
The Little Crocodile is here.

89
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.791
Captain Langerman.

90
00:34:39.875 --> 00:34:41.291
Brigadier.

91
00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:44.541
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you.
And he's on the warpath.

92
00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.416
-Brigadier, we've been on this case--
-I'm not talking to you.

93
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.833
What's that?

94
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.416
It's a helicopter, Brigadier.

95
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
I know what it is, Schoeman.

96
00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.958
But why is it standing there?
In front of Uncle Paul?

97
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.166
Fix it.

98
00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:08.250
Oh, and…

99
00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:11.041
Have you seen the bank manifest?

100
00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:19.833
The Justice Minister's daughter,
Christine, is one of the hostages.

101
00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:22.125
Really, sir?

102
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:26.875
Yes, Schoeman.

103
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.333
Really.

104
00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:30.500
That's why I'm here.

105
00:35:30.583 --> 00:35:34.583
With all the horses, the dogs,
the guns, the soldiers, and everything.

106
00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:41.250
This crap stops now.

107
00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:43.500
Do you understand me, Captain?

108
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:43.000
What's the plan?

109
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:31.666
Khumalo. You're starting again.

110
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.416
Let's not give them any other way.

111
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:41.125
NOW MORE THAN 1000 000 000 STRONGER.

112
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.916
Dear Lord

113
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:49.791
We pray to you…

114
00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:55.125
My love.

115
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:37.750
I didn't get that.

116
00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:39.125
Calm down, please.

117
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:04.916
Dammit.

118
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:58.500
Khumalo, what are you doing?

119
00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:00.083
Khumalo! Talk to me.

120
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:27.958
Aldo, my machine gun.

121
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:40.583
Get ready.

122
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.458
Take them now.

123
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.625
No, wait, Brigadier,
something's not right.

124
00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:02.333
There they are, standing outside.

125
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.833
Shoot them.

126
00:47:03.916 --> 00:47:06.833
No, one of those three
isn't one of our suspects.

127
00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:09.875
I didn't say he's one of our suspects.
I gave you an order.

128
00:47:09.958 --> 00:47:11.000
Shoot the bastards now.

129
00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:13.875
Calvin is cunning as a jackal.

130
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:17.375
He wouldn't just expose himself like that.

131
00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:19.583
I think that man might be a hostage.

132
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:23.083
Now you listen to me, Captain.

133
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.416
I gave you an order.

134
00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:28.875
-Power to the people!
-Power to the people!

135
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:35.458
You nearly caused
an international incident.

136
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:37.500
That was an American hostage.

137
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.916
But he's Black!

138
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:44.958
I couldn't care less that he's American.

139
00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.625
Shut them up!

140
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:52.875
Get rid of this damn disturbance.
I do not want to hear them!

141
00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:05.541
Power to the people!

142
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.791
No, Khumalo.

143
00:50:39.833 --> 00:50:42.000
That bloody captain
is a piece of shit.

144
00:50:43.625 --> 00:50:44.708
I swear…

145
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:55.458
Excuse me.

146
00:50:59.041 --> 00:51:01.791
Erasmus, please
deal with this dog before I kill him.

147
00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:21.333
Christine, you mad?
What do you think you're doing?

148
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:14.458
Let's go.

149
00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:08.875
What are you doing?

150
00:57:46.666 --> 00:57:48.375
See you later.

151
00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:52.625
-Doesn't wanna come out.
-Why not?

152
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:05.958
No.

153
00:59:06.583 --> 00:59:09.500
-How do you mean "No," Brigadier?
-Because I say no.

154
00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:12.750
We could use her to persuade
Christine to come out of the bank.

155
00:59:14.375 --> 00:59:16.625
Let me explain something to you both.

156
00:59:16.708 --> 00:59:19.291
You want us to turn a maid

157
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.958
into a heroine on national television?

158
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.958
How desperate do you want us to look?

159
00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.416
Fuck.

160
00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:35.750
Fuck.

161
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.583
Captain!

162
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.458
If your plan doesn't work, mine will.

163
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:19.666
Hurry up. Don't have all day.

164
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.583
That's definitely shots. Go!

165
01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.916
Khumalo, shoot him, man!

166
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.208
Get up, dog.

167
01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.083
Terra, let me have a look…

168
01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:00.250
I'm all right.

169
01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.750
Not now, man.

170
01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:07.291
Pastor. I'm doing my best.

171
01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:01.416
Dog.

172
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.125
Khumalo, what does he want in here?

173
01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.458
Don't stress, Terra.

174
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.625
People outside
are worried about you.

175
01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.916
Come with me, please.

176
01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:54.541
No.

177
01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:51.583
Terra, what are you doing?

178
01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.458
Terra, what did you do?

179
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:30.875
I should shoot you in the head.

180
01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:43.416
I agree, Honorable Minister.

181
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:45.583
Yes.

182
01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:47.666
Naturally.

183
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.791
I will make absolutely sure of it.

184
01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:53.083
Thank you, Honorable Minister.

185
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.541
Get ready to breach.

186
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.541
What? What about the hostages?

187
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:10.458
-No longer important.
-Brigadier…

188
01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:13.541
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.

189
01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:15.375
They could surrender, Brigadier.

190
01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:17.250
We can find a peaceful solution.

191
01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:19.583
You think that after
what happened in there

192
01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:21.125
that you can convince him?

193
01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:22.875
When I was in the bank

194
01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:26.625
I saw a man
who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.

195
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:30.708
He could have kept me hostage
but he didn't. Why?

196
01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:36.208
I think this whole situation,
the violence, the murder

197
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.791
it's consuming him.

198
01:16:38.416 --> 01:16:42.916
You want me to believe
that damn terrorist in there

199
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.250
is a good man?

200
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.375
No.

201
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.291
What I'm saying

202
01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:49.291
is that Calvin Khumalo

203
01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.625
is fighting for justice.

204
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.916
And he doesn't want to lose more people.

205
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.041
And that's

206
01:16:58.291 --> 01:16:59.666
your problem.

207
01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.791
You think that trash in there

208
01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:04.500
are people.

209
01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:12.458
Out!

210
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:33.166
We are only human
through other human beings.

211
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.125
We are only human
through other human beings.

212
01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:12.291
Think of your family.

213
01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:15.166
Of your father. Please.

214
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:16.166
Father.

215
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.958
Please, Father, I implore you.

216
01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:19.500
I know you can see me.

217
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.000
Do what they ask. Please.

218
01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.375
Do the right thing.

219
01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:53.041
Officers, come and fetch this woman.

220
01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:01.250
Stand down.

221
01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.041
Stand down.

222
01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.250
Come on, Christine. Come on.

223
01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:48.666
It's a matter of national security.

224
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.916
Come with me.

225
01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.416
I'm tired.

226
01:23:58.458 --> 01:23:59.375
I know.

227
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.875
I know.

228
01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:15.125
Don't let them worry you.

229
01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.708
You did the right thing.

230
01:24:17.708 --> 01:24:20.208
-We'll look after you, soldier.
-Thank you, Brigadier.

231
01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:21.916
Dismissed.

232
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.875
Khumalo, you have a phone call.

233
01:29:13.875 --> 01:29:14.916
Thank you.

234
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.041
Langerman, go home.

235
01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.083
Spend some time with your wife.

236
01:30:02.166 --> 01:30:03.875
That's an order.

237
01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:06.708
Because you are now done.

238
01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:41.208
Move in.

239
01:30:58.375 --> 01:30:59.333
Father!

240
01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:11.333
We kill dogs!

241
01:31:20.333 --> 01:31:22.375
Fuck you!

242
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:32.041
This will be easy!

243
01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:54.250
Bastards!

244
01:31:59.416 --> 01:32:00.750
We showed them.

245
01:32:00.833 --> 01:32:02.583
We showed those dogs.

246
01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:09.666
-We made them dance.
-Yeah.

247
01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.916
You know those dogs got me.

248
01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:17.958
This is just a graze.

249
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.500
Hold fast.

250
01:32:52.875 --> 01:32:53.875
Hold fast.

251
01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:57.791
Dammit.

252
01:32:59.875 --> 01:33:01.291
Get ready to go in.
