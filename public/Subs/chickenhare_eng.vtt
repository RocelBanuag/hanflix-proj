1
00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.875
Told you I'd find it.

2
00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.917
But not if they found it first.

3
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.375
I doubt it.

4
00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:09.542
It looks to me like that crocodile
won't have to feed for a while.

5
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:35.917
And to think you,

6
00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.458
and everyone, doubted me.

7
00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:41.708
I don't even know why
I let you come, Brother…

8
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.417
I'm sure you'll think of a reason.

9
00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:10.000
The Hamster of Darkness.

10
00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:12.708
Finally.

11
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.000
When I bring this back
to the kingdom,

12
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.042
nobody's going to be laughing
at my ear anymore.

13
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.250
No,

14
00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.917
I'm going to be the one
who's laughing…

15
00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.583
not at my ear of course.

16
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.500
But because I was right,

17
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.042
that the hamster is real.

18
00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.583
Something does not feel right.

19
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.958
Oh hush,

20
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.583
let me enjoy
this glorious moment.

21
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:48.958
Huh?

22
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.042
<i>Twenty years ago my father</i>
<i>and his brother Lapin</i>

23
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.292
<i>almost found the greatest</i>
<i>artifact in the world.</i>

24
00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.208
I'm sorry, Lapin.

25
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.750
This isn't happening.

26
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.333
- What the…?
- Over there.

27
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.000
<i>But they found something else…</i>

28
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.750
<i>Me.</i>

29
00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:27.208
What is it?

30
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.333
The freak's pointing at my ear!

31
00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.208
No, he's not.

32
00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.208
He did it again!

33
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.833
Nonsense. He's adorable.

34
00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.792
Hi there, little guy.

35
00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.708
You're not taking him back with us?

36
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:42.917
I'm not leaving him.

37
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:46.333
Good thing I'm the older brother
and will be king someday,

38
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.958
because you're too soft!

39
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.000
Way too soft!

40
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.042
<i>My uncle never found</i>
<i>the Hamster of Darkness.</i>

41
00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.958
<i>And he was never named king.</i>

42
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.542
<i>But we'll get to that soon enough…</i>

43
00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:32.417
<i>From the moment</i>
<i>my dad brought me home,</i>

44
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.333
<i>I was preparing for the day</i>

45
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.292
<i>when I would become</i>
<i>a great adventurer like him.</i>

46
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:44.042
There you go.

47
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.417
Ow, ow!

48
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.333
Nice slap of the wrist.

49
00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:56.250
No, no!

50
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.000
Hm? Ah?

51
00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:00.917
What do you think?

52
00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:08.125
<i>My favorite days were the days</i>

53
00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:10.833
<i>when my dad returned</i>
<i>from an adventure…</i>

54
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.333
I don't see what the big deal is…

55
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.250
I mean, they just found old junk.

56
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:20.125
I find old junk in alleys
and nobody's throwing me a parade.

57
00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:22.458
That's my turtle servant Abe.

58
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.333
He's a "glass-is-all-empty" kind of guy.

59
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:29.125
- Dad!
- Hi there, little guy.

60
00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.625
Did you find the fork
from the last brunch?

61
00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:33.792
And the knife!

62
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.667
But I couldn't find the spoon!

63
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:40.625
Of course, I found the spoon!

64
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.708
<i>When I saw how everyone looked up</i>
<i>to adventurers like my dad,</i>

65
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.125
<i>there and then I decided</i>
<i>that's how I wanted them to see me.</i>

66
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.667
And so there I was, 200 feet
above hare-eating crocodiles,

67
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:06.125
hanging from a cliff.

68
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.667
- And then what happened?
- And then…

69
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.917
you went to bed.

70
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.667
Hey, that's why they call it
a cliffhanger, pal.

71
00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:22.458
Good night,
my future royal adventurer.

72
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:42.042
<i>I was obsessed with adventuring.</i>

73
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.625
<i>I stayed up every night reading.</i>

74
00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:54.125
Stupid feathers…

75
00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:04.042
<i>I devoured every book about adventuring</i>
<i>and spent hours in the royal library…</i>

76
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.833
<i>I could not get enough of it.</i>
<i>I knew the day would come.</i>

77
00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:24.208
Ah! I don't think heavy lifting
is in my job description.

78
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.792
The tryouts, let's go, Abe.

79
00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:11.917
<i>Every year I watched</i>
<i>the Royal Adventure Society tryouts,</i>

80
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.125
<i>determined to pick up tips</i>
<i>for when it was my turn.</i>

81
00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.333
Why'd you invite him to sit with us?

82
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.875
My dad made me
'cause his dad's the new king.

83
00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:26.750
Why we gotta be seen
with that freak Chickenhare?

84
00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:29.625
It could be worse.
We could be Chickenhare.

85
00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.125
- Right?
- Oh man.

86
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:18.167
That was a lot of fun.

87
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:19.750
What a crock,

88
00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:23.208
the competitors are getting
better and better every year.

89
00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.500
- Some world classic…
- Chickenhare?

90
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.667
What are you wearing?

91
00:09:28.833 --> 00:09:31.917
Like it? It's very in.

92
00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:34.458
It's very now… now.

93
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:39.125
Boots that make you look like
you have hare feet are very now… now?

94
00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:42.167
Style's changed a lot since
you were a kid, Dad.

95
00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.917
Come on,
let's take that hat off so I can…

96
00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:46.125
No!

97
00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:48.625
Everybody laughs at me, Dad.

98
00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.917
I know it's hard being different.

99
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:55.958
No, you don't know.
Nobody knows what it's like to be me.

100
00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.875
Chickenhare,
now what have I always told you?

101
00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:02.542
The things that make us different…

102
00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.292
Are what make us special.

103
00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:08.125
Yeah, I know, Dad.
But I don't wanna be special.

104
00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:10.083
I just wanna be normal.

105
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:12.292
And wearing this,

106
00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:15.042
I feel normal.

107
00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:20.667
Maybe I'm not as up
on the fashion trends as I used to be.

108
00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.083
It's not just you, Dad!

109
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.667
It's all old people.

110
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.833
Oh! And check out
what I can do in my new boots.

111
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.417
Ow! I'm okay.

112
00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:35.583
All good…

113
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.167
Little sore, but good.

114
00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.750
It's just a phase.
He'll grow out of it.

115
00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:17.292
This is it, Abe. Moment of truth.

116
00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.667
The day all my dreams come true.

117
00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.542
Remember my three keys to success?

118
00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:25.458
Don't. Screw. Up.

119
00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.000
In accordance with the laws
in the Royal Rulebook,

120
00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.208
those applicants today
who reach the finish line

121
00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:37.333
shall be considered for
the Royal Adventure Society for life.

122
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.083
First up, Chickenhare.

123
00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:54.708
This should be interesting!

124
00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.125
Come on!

125
00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:20.333
That's just slowing me down.

126
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.500
What are you doing?

127
00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:40.417
Ouch, that hurts.

128
00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:48.208
Just getting my bearings.

129
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.875
Time to make up some ground.

130
00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:08.458
Here we go.

131
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:11.542
No!

132
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.417
Ah!

133
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.542
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Just go on.

134
00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.417
Sorry!

135
00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:45.667
Yes!

136
00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:47.583
Hey, that's cheating!

137
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:08.958
Come on.

138
00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.250
You're almost there.

139
00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:13.792
All you have to do is get across
the Really-Really-Deep-

140
00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.750
But-Not-Quite-Bottomless-Pit.

141
00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:22.125
Careful, Son.

142
00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:25.875
I can't watch,
but I can't look away.

143
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:33.208
Easy.

144
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.375
- Come here.
- Let it go!

145
00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:49.958
No, no!

146
00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:11.083
- Well, there's always a plan B.
- I don't have a plan B.

147
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.333
You could become a stamp collector.

148
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.333
It's like an adventure
every time the mail comes.

149
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.000
And the mail comes every day.
That's a lot of adventures.

150
00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:24.667
Ah, what's so great
about being a royal adventurer anyway?

151
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.458
Besides the fame and adulation?

152
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:29.375
Hey, Chickenhare, nice work today!

153
00:15:29.542 --> 00:15:32.375
- Nothing but net!
- Yeah!

154
00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:35.417
Hey, what'd you expect?
He's mostly chicken.

155
00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:37.458
Pfft. No, he's mostly hare.

156
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:38.708
- Chicken!
- Hare!

157
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.417
- Chicken!
- Hare!

158
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:44.125
You know, if you close your eyes
and take it out of context,

159
00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:46.333
it sounds like
they're cheering for you.

160
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.708
Chicken! Hare! Chicken! Hare!

161
00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:50.875
Chicken! Hare! Chicken…

162
00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:59.583
Why can't I be like everyone else?

163
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.208
Chickenhare?

164
00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:03.333
Geez, Dad,
think you could knock?

165
00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.333
Sorry.

166
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.208
Thought you'd wanna talk
about what happened today.

167
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.250
Oh, that.

168
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:12.208
Just a minor setback is all.

169
00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:15.167
Next year, I'm gonna focus
on doing more cardio.

170
00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:17.625
Maybe some altitude training.

171
00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:20.333
You do know you can't audition twice.

172
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.083
I figured since you're the King,
you could make an exception.

173
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.167
I can't break the rules
just because you're my son.

174
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:28.792
Come on, Dad.

175
00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.792
All I need is one more shot.
I could crush it…

176
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.667
You need to put
your energies elsewhere.

177
00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:42.083
I know it's difficult
to let go of your dream.

178
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.833
I… I just don't want
to see you get hurt again.

179
00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:49.250
Is this because I embarrassed you?

180
00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:53.458
Oh, Chickenhare.
You could never embarrass me.

181
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:57.708
When I look at you,
I wish you could see what I see.

182
00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.708
Yeah, wish I could too.

183
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:03.500
All I see is that I got the worst parts
of a hare and a chicken.

184
00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:05.958
Maybe you got the best parts.

185
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.625
Do you know

186
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.750
the greatest treasure I ever found?

187
00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:12.916
The Fountain of Middle Age?

188
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:14.500
It was you.

189
00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:19.375
Finding you when Uncle Lapin and I went
searching for the Hamster of Darkness

190
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.250
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

191
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:24.875
Goodnight, Son.

192
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.750
Oh, shut up!

193
00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:45.292
I've studied adventuring

194
00:17:45.458 --> 00:17:46.917
more than anybody, right?

195
00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:50.667
So, I've just gotta figure out
the location of the one treasure

196
00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:54.625
that every adventurer has been
searching for, but has never found…

197
00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:01.042
- Woah!
- And when I figure that out,

198
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:03.917
he'll have to let me
into the Royal Adventurer Society.

199
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:07.875
What's the treasure?

200
00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.125
Come on,
you know what I'm talking about.

201
00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:14.167
The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time…

202
00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:18.125
Gotcha. The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time.

203
00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:19.333
I have no idea.

204
00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:23.500
Arturo the Rodent King created it
to take over the world.

205
00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:25.167
Doesn't ring a bell.

206
00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.708
Then his brother Ramon
stole it and hid it

207
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.750
before Arturo could use it.

208
00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:33.708
It has the power of a million hamsters!

209
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:35.583
Oh!

210
00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.875
Nope, still don't have it.

211
00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:40.458
It rhymes
with the "Damster of Harkness"…

212
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:41.625
Shh!

213
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.167
The Hamster of Darkness, Abe!
How could you not get that?

214
00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:53.375
From where I'm sitting,
it was a problem with the clues.

215
00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:55.333
According to the old legends,

216
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.667
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn,

217
00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.125
the constellation
of the hamster shall point

218
00:19:01.292 --> 00:19:03.500
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

219
00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:04.958
Well, it's almost 9

220
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:08.208
which means I'm about
to make time-and-a-half. Cha-ching!

221
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.167
There's one problem.

222
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.875
You can't see a constellation
at 9 in the morning.

223
00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:14.125
It's too bright out.

224
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:17.000
- We gotta be missing something.
- Yeah, breakfast.

225
00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:19.208
- I'm starving!
- I need the original text.

226
00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.167
<i>Erik the Literal's Volume 13</i>

227
00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:36.833
on the Hamster of Darkness
is checked out.

228
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.333
When's it due back?

229
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.458
Three months ago.

230
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.250
Fine, I'll go get it myself.
So, who's got it?

231
00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.750
Your Uncle Lapin.

232
00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:55.083
So, uh, how long has it been
since you've seen your uncle?

233
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.917
Not since he tried
to overthrow my father.

234
00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:01.875
He wasn't happy that my grandfather
chose my dad as king and not him.

235
00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:03.958
Talk about rich people's problems.

236
00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:05.375
Ah, let's go.

237
00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:06.917
Time has mellowed him.

238
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:09.125
Oh no.
My duties as your turtleservant

239
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.250
do not extend to accompanying you

240
00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:14.167
to meet with your terrifying uncle
in his jail cell.

241
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.750
Nothing about meeting
with evil uncles in jail…

242
00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:21.500
See, this is why you join a union.

243
00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:24.333
Servants-and-Bed-Pan-Handlers Local 645.

244
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.542
Strength through numbers.

245
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.083
- What's he in for?
- Murder.

246
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.250
Tax evasion.

247
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:55.958
Ha! I murdered the tax code.

248
00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:00.333
The prison that can hold Barry Goldfarb
hasn't been built!

249
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.042
Some rules to remember:

250
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:06.500
Do not pass Lapin anything
as he will turn it into a weapon,

251
00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:07.875
even a carrot.

252
00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:10.458
Don't approach the cell.
Don't touch the bars.

253
00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:12.667
And don't reach through the bars.

254
00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:15.708
The last guy to do that
spent a month in the hospital.

255
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:19.792
Granted that was for the flu.
But I'm sure he caught it from Lapin.

256
00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.083
Huh?

257
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.750
You're not coming with me?

258
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:26.083
The union says I don't have to.
Thank goodness

259
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.167
for Prison-Guards-and-Haberdashers
Local 646.

260
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.125
Strength through numbers.

261
00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:00.833
Nephew?

262
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:03.750
What a pleasant surprise.

263
00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:05.625
Hi, Uncle Lapin.

264
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:09.333
I was in the neighborhood
and, uh, thought it might be nice

265
00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.792
to stop by and say "hi".

266
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:14.208
So, um…

267
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.750
Hi!

268
00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:17.625
And oh yeah,

269
00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:20.417
there's this book
that you got from the library.

270
00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:22.542
It's actually long overdue.

271
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.583
Oh no.
What are they gonna do,

272
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.792
lock me up?

273
00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:30.625
Right.

274
00:22:30.792 --> 00:22:33.375
That's funny because
you're already locked up

275
00:22:33.542 --> 00:22:35.458
for trying to overthrow my father.

276
00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:38.750
Well, I always did have a problem
with authority.

277
00:22:38.917 --> 00:22:42.250
So, you're looking
for the Hamster of Darkness,

278
00:22:42.417 --> 00:22:43.417
are you?

279
00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:44.875
Oh, no, no.

280
00:22:45.042 --> 00:22:46.458
I don't think it's real.

281
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:47.625
Really?

282
00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:51.542
Every time I've requested
a book on adventuring

283
00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:55.292
and it wasn't in,
it was because you had checked it out.

284
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.500
Somebody's been doing
their homework.

285
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:01.583
It's real. And we both know it.

286
00:23:02.042 --> 00:23:04.542
It'd be quite a feather
in your cap to bring back

287
00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:07.167
to the Royal Adventure Society,

288
00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:08.333
wouldn't it?

289
00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:10.917
Maybe…

290
00:23:11.542 --> 00:23:12.917
Such a waste.

291
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:15.625
You see, when I find
the Hamster of Darkness,

292
00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:18.583
I'm going to use it
to take over the kingdom.

293
00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:22.292
I'm just joking.

294
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:25.125
Besides, I'm locked in this tower

295
00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:28.125
that no one has ever escaped from.

296
00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:29.625
You think I've been waiting

297
00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:33.208
for your visit because
you were the final piece of my escape?

298
00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:36.833
I wish I was that cunning. But now…

299
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.833
let me find that book for you.

300
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:43.167
Is this the one?

301
00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:45.625
Oh yeah, that's the one.

302
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.792
So, uh, if you'd just toss it
on over here,

303
00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:52.750
I'll get out of your way
and you can go back

304
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:55.750
to marking the days
on the wall with chalk.

305
00:23:56.083 --> 00:24:00.708
I'm afraid my time in here
has weakened me.

306
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.042
Come over here.

307
00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:06.833
Why not just give it a little toss?

308
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Huh?

309
00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:11.000
On second thought,

310
00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:12.708
I… I'll come get it.

311
00:24:16.292 --> 00:24:17.583
Oops.

312
00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:26.917
Hold on.
I just remembered…

313
00:24:27.292 --> 00:24:28.500
I'm not done with it.

314
00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:34.042
Goodbye, Chickenhare.

315
00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.042
Don't forget your hat.

316
00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:05.875
Oh no…

317
00:25:11.917 --> 00:25:16.292
"Dear Brother,
enjoy your last days as king.

318
00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.333
All the best, Lapin."

319
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.125
I'm sorry, Dad.

320
00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:23.083
You know you're not allowed
to visit Lapin!

321
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:24.500
What were you thinking?

322
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.625
He had this book I needed
about the Hamster of Darkness.

323
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.708
- See I figured…
- I told you to let it go.

324
00:25:31.792 --> 00:25:33.125
Sir, it's a map!

325
00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:37.125
"The Tomb of the Unknown Turtle"?

326
00:25:37.292 --> 00:25:40.750
The old adventurer Frederic
the Extremely Short proposed that

327
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:43.667
as one of the locations
of the Hamster of Darkness.

328
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.417
That's where Lapin's going.

329
00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:47.500
Ready my boat.
We leave immediately.

330
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:52.500
Dad, I know everything
about the Hamster of Darkness.

331
00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:53.792
Bring me, I can help.

332
00:25:54.167 --> 00:25:56.958
No. You've done enough already.

333
00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:24.042
Hey, Boss, just came by
to see how you're doing.

334
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.208
Other than letting the most dangerous
criminal escape.

335
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:28.917
- I'm doing great.
- You are?

336
00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:32.208
- Look what was behind the books.
- An abstract painting?

337
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:33.833
A map, Abe.

338
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Oh.

339
00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.583
Lapin's obsessed
with the Hamster of Darkness.

340
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.375
It doesn't make sense
that he'd think

341
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:42.250
the Temple would be
at the Tomb of the Unknown Turtle.

342
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:45.250
That's been searched many times.

343
00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:47.208
It's a minute before 9,

344
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.042
something's missing.

345
00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.542
The moths are gonna be
the only ones to miss Lapin.

346
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.083
It's winter.

347
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.875
There are no moths.

348
00:26:57.458 --> 00:26:58.917
It's the constellation!

349
00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:00.708
Coincidence.

350
00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:01.958
It's not, Abe.

351
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.417
Lapin has been on this quest for years.

352
00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:07.375
It's not a blanket,
it's a curtain, give me that.

353
00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:14.250
You see, total coincidence.

354
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:16.375
I'm not so sure.

355
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:17.958
Let me clear the floor.

356
00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:19.333
Yes, that's it!

357
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.750
The book.

358
00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:29.000
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn,

359
00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:31.083
the constellation shall point

360
00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:34.250
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

361
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:57.375
Bingo.

362
00:27:57.917 --> 00:28:01.042
Where's the "X"? Don't maps need
an "X" to mark the spot?

363
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.500
Oh, darn tropes.

364
00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:11.000
Dad! Wait!

365
00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:13.000
You're going the wrong way!

366
00:28:16.417 --> 00:28:18.208
We need to get a boat ready.

367
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:21.292
We have to beat Lapin
to the Hamster of Darkness.

368
00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:24.667
Oh no, forget about it.
I am not an adventurer.

369
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:27.625
And you're…
How do I put this delicately?

370
00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:29.458
You're… you.

371
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.417
Maybe I'm not much of an adventurer,

372
00:28:31.583 --> 00:28:33.958
but we're the only ones
who can do this now.

373
00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:35.750
And if we don't,

374
00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:38.625
Lapin's gonna come back
and take over the kingdom.

375
00:28:38.792 --> 00:28:41.167
Well, unemployment is kinda high.

376
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:43.667
And your dad's been king for what?
15 years?

377
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:46.250
This is serious, Abe.
And it's all my fault.

378
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:49.208
Not all. Only like 90%.

379
00:28:49.417 --> 00:28:51.708
I'm going.
And I want you to come with me.

380
00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:54.708
I'm your servant.
I'm legally bound to go with you.

381
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:59.125
No. I'm not asking as your master.

382
00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:01.042
I'm asking you as a friend.

383
00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:04.292
Well, that makes it an easy decision.

384
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:08.625
Actually, that makes it
an incredibly difficult decision.

385
00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:10.500
Can you be friends with your boss?

386
00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:14.500
Isn't the relationship completely skewed
by the power dynamic?

387
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:15.667
What?

388
00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:17.458
These are deep questions.

389
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:20.417
I, for one, find them
intellectually invigorating.

390
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:21.583
Wait, wait.

391
00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.083
Actually, sorry, keep going.

392
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.417
Wait.

393
00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:28.667
I'm coming…

394
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:30.042
friend.

395
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:32.833
But be prepared
for a lot of "I told you so's."

396
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:44.000
<i>I have been at sea</i>
<i>for 12 long minutes.</i>

397
00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:46.000
<i>The heat is unbearable.</i>

398
00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:48.667
<i>Thirst is a constant companion.</i>

399
00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:50.417
<i>And as for hunger,</i>

400
00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:54.667
<i>I may be developing</i>
<i>a taste for chicken and hare.</i>

401
00:29:59.208 --> 00:30:00.917
Not too late to turn around.

402
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.125
I always wanted an adventure.

403
00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:05.750
I just hope we can pull it off.

404
00:30:05.917 --> 00:30:07.167
I'm sure we will.

405
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.250
<i>I have no confidence</i>
<i>in our chances.</i>

406
00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:16.500
<i>If you're reading this,</i>
<i>I've either been crushed,</i>

407
00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:19.375
<i>impaled, pole-axed, harpooned,</i>

408
00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:22.125
<i>eaten alive by carnivorous beetles,</i>

409
00:30:22.292 --> 00:30:24.667
<i>drowned in a sea full of sharks,</i>

410
00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:28.500
<i>killed by birds</i>
<i>pecking at my every being.</i>

411
00:30:42.417 --> 00:30:44.083
So, so parched.

412
00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:45.792
Ow!

413
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.583
Water?

414
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.542
Oh, that goes down nice.
Oh yeah.

415
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:54.917
So, parched.

416
00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:57.542
That jet stream gets me every time.

417
00:30:57.708 --> 00:30:58.792
Well?

418
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.667
Huh? Oh, yeah uh…

419
00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:03.792
The King took the bait.
All's going like we planned.

420
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:05.167
Like <i>we</i> planned?

421
00:31:05.583 --> 00:31:06.708
Well, yeah, okay.

422
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:10.417
Technically it was your plan,
but I agreed it was a great plan.

423
00:31:10.583 --> 00:31:13.208
No, it's the perfect plan.

424
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.583
Well, not quite perfect.

425
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.250
- What?
- Uh… it's your nephew.

426
00:31:18.417 --> 00:31:19.542
The freak?

427
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.792
He knows where the hamster is.

428
00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:25.375
And he and his little turtle friend
are following us.

429
00:31:25.542 --> 00:31:27.750
Hey, I figured we could wait for them,

430
00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:31.625
then flank them
and engage them in a nautical battle.

431
00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:35.083
I've always wanted
to be in a nautical battle.

432
00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:39.292
Please remember you're here
because of your wings, not your brain.

433
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:42.083
I can't waste valuable time
on the off chance

434
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.208
that the freak actually makes it
across the ocean.

435
00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:47.292
No,

436
00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:50.083
we'll subcontract this one out.

437
00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:54.833
And I have just the animal
for the job.

438
00:31:57.542 --> 00:31:58.667
<i>Luther,</i>

439
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.375
<i>the last member of our team.</i>

440
00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:03.500
<i>The most ruthless animal</i>

441
00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:05.917
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of working with.</i>

442
00:32:06.083 --> 00:32:07.083
<i>He's so mean,</i>

443
00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:09.833
<i>he once killed an animal</i>

444
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.750
<i>just for snoring.</i>

445
00:32:11.917 --> 00:32:12.917
Oh!

446
00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:16.458
I, um… I have sleep apnea.

447
00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.708
And it's… It's pretty bad.

448
00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.458
Can we get separate rooms?

449
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:25.292
Lapin, it's been too long.

450
00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:28.958
It's okay, little guy…

451
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:30.792
Coo coo coo!

452
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:54.000
This is where Alexander the Sweaty
discovered the Mustache of Destiny.

453
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.333
Isn't this place great?

454
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.125
Yeah. Great place to get murdered.
Why are we here anyway?

455
00:33:01.292 --> 00:33:02.583
Follow me.

456
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:05.958
This very tavern

457
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:09.417
is where Hector the Lost
hired the legless sherpa

458
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.583
who led him to the Atheist's Temple.

459
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.417
I never thought I'd see it
with my own eyes.

460
00:33:14.583 --> 00:33:17.333
I think you and I have
very different bucket lists.

461
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:23.333
With any luck,
this is where we'll find our guide.

462
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:25.708
Or at least a communicable disease.

463
00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:27.625
Hey. You need a guide?

464
00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:29.417
I'm your gal.

465
00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:32.458
I know that jungle
like the back of my tail.

466
00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:35.125
Don't do it, kid. She's bad news.

467
00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:37.792
Only a fool without a snout
would hire a skunk.

468
00:33:37.958 --> 00:33:39.958
The guy you want's over there.

469
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.000
Uh, excuse me?

470
00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:49.792
I'm looking for a guide.

471
00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:53.125
Well, fellow hare,

472
00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:54.917
you've come to the right rat.

473
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.792
The name's Rusty,
but my sense of direction's not.

474
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:02.792
Come on, let's go talk in the back,
away from prying ears.

475
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:05.333
Yup.
I think we can totally trust this guy.

476
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.292
Not suspicious at all.

477
00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:16.375
- So Rusty, we gotta go to…
- I already know where you're going.

478
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:18.042
You do?

479
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.750
Wow.
No wonder you're a guide.

480
00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.792
You're going with him.

481
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:29.833
He's joking, right?

482
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.417
Tell me we've stumbled
into a very messed-up daycare.

483
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:38.625
Uh… Rusty?

484
00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:40.000
Is this guide humor?

485
00:34:40.167 --> 00:34:44.208
You didn't tell me this guy was looking
for the Hamster of Darkness.

486
00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:48.375
You lose your manners
along with that eye?

487
00:34:48.542 --> 00:34:50.250
Stay out of this, skunk!

488
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:52.750
Yeah, it's me,
I'm Meg by the way.

489
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:56.083
I don't care.
Now give me that map.

490
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.042
Over our dead bodies.

491
00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:01.250
So, Mr. Gorilla, just to be clear,

492
00:35:01.417 --> 00:35:04.458
Meg was speaking metaphorically
about dead bodies.

493
00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:06.708
Uh-oh, he's a literalist.

494
00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:17.458
Take this!

495
00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:20.000
Yeah, my kind of girl!

496
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.167
We're in a bar fight!

497
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:28.250
Woah!

498
00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:38.792
Our map! He's getting away.

499
00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:40.833
Or not.

500
00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:45.917
Yeah, come on,
is that all you got?

501
00:35:57.417 --> 00:35:59.958
Meg, you're amazing.

502
00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:03.208
I assume you're not going
with Rusty as your guide

503
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.542
because of the whole betrayal thing.

504
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:07.083
You're hired!

505
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.042
This should be a lesson,
don't judge a book by its cover,

506
00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:13.917
'cause you might end up
reading a really bad book.

507
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.500
Uh…

508
00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:25.208
I'm really, really sorry.

509
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:27.167
Meg? We've got a problem…

510
00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:29.042
And I've got the solution.

511
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:30.792
Guys, put these on.

512
00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:33.583
Now.

513
00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:37.917
Ah!

514
00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:43.167
What a blast!

515
00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:45.792
I'm gonna keep this if that's okay.

516
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.667
Oh darn,
I need to change your diaper.

517
00:36:57.208 --> 00:37:01.292
Hold up. This sweat is chaffing me
like there's no tomorrow…

518
00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:03.292
Which there probably isn't.

519
00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:06.208
Ah…

520
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.125
That's better.

521
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:14.042
A little hot in that jacket?

522
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:17.583
Not at all.
I'm actually a little cold.

523
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.917
Okay… So, I know
we haven't talked compensation,

524
00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:22.875
but I have a proposal.

525
00:37:23.042 --> 00:37:26.167
I'll take you to wherever
you wanna go for free.

526
00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:27.708
What's the catch?

527
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:30.167
I've been on a number
of adventures myself,

528
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.750
exclusively solo expeditions
'cause of the skunk thing.

529
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:37.708
And the truth is,
it's been kind of lonely.

530
00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:47.500
Meg, you can stay
with us as long as you like.

531
00:37:47.917 --> 00:37:49.042
- Really?
- Really?

532
00:37:49.208 --> 00:37:51.750
You are not going to regret this.
No sirree.

533
00:37:51.917 --> 00:37:55.125
I gotta say, I think we're on the cusp
of something great.

534
00:37:55.292 --> 00:37:58.167
Something epic,
something unprecedented.

535
00:37:58.625 --> 00:37:59.667
Ah!

536
00:37:59.833 --> 00:38:03.875
Hamster of Darkness. That's the Big One.

537
00:38:04.042 --> 00:38:06.625
When we find it,
they'll put us on the cover

538
00:38:06.792 --> 00:38:09.667
of <i>Adventure Weekly</i>
and <i>Adventure Monthly</i>.

539
00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:13.958
And Chickenhare,
if they put your name first,

540
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:17.667
I'm totally fine with that,
just happy to be part of the team.

541
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:20.458
You think she brought anything
to plug my ears?

542
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.583
Hey, what kind of name
is Chickenhare anyway?

543
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.375
Is that part Yukinarian?

544
00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:29.083
Uh… I actually don't know.

545
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.000
Really? No clue?
Because it is such a unique name.

546
00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:35.250
Well, it's very unusual.

547
00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:38.167
Because I see the hare,
but I don't see the chicken.

548
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:41.042
I'm gonna figure this out,
I'm great at puzzles.

549
00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:52.167
Well, that's too bad.
Looks like we'll have to head back.

550
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.542
Follow me.

551
00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:58.333
Your turn.

552
00:38:59.125 --> 00:39:01.083
Why can't I meet anyone

553
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.167
who shares my pessimism?

554
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:04.458
Ow!

555
00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:10.167
If you take off that jacket,
it might help with your follow-through.

556
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:13.250
Just a suggestion.
What do I know, I'm just a skunk.

557
00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:17.292
No, no. I'm good!
Third time's a charm!

558
00:39:18.708 --> 00:39:19.708
Oops.

559
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:21.875
Now what?

560
00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:26.083
Stay put and don't try
anything foolish.

561
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:36.708
I expected more from you, Luther.

562
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:39.833
I won't tolerate another mistake.

563
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.375
And why is this thing even here,

564
00:39:43.542 --> 00:39:47.042
why isn't he at home with your wife?
What has happened to you?

565
00:39:47.208 --> 00:39:49.875
See, Lapin,
me and my wife have 2-3 jobs.

566
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:52.417
It's hard, you know,
providing for the baby.

567
00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:55.708
See, I can't afford
the cost of diapers and…

568
00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:56.875
Enough!

569
00:39:57.042 --> 00:40:01.208
Has the entire criminal underworld
gone soft since I've been locked up?

570
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.708
Do me a favor,
go back to your wife.

571
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:08.708
Go!

572
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.833
- Woah!
- Oh good, the duck's back.

573
00:40:14.333 --> 00:40:16.500
Please tell me
something positive.

574
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.125
Chickenhare made it through
the Desert of Death.

575
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:21.125
What? Impossible!

576
00:40:21.292 --> 00:40:24.792
Well, technically improbable
since he did make it through.

577
00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:26.583
He's a couple clicks behind us.

578
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.250
What are clicks?

579
00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:32.375
I hear that term on missions like this,
but I don't know what they are.

580
00:40:32.542 --> 00:40:34.458
Destroy the bridge.

581
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.333
It will take them a week
to get around the quicksand.

582
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.833
By then, I'll have Featherbeard
completely under my control.

583
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.083
Our control.

584
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.417
Huh?

585
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:49.917
Your control… obviously.

586
00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:06.292
Ugh. We'll have to go around,
that's gonna take at least a week.

587
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:07.958
We don't have a week.

588
00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:11.000
My Uncle Lapin'll already have
the hamster by then.

589
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:12.208
We can cross it.

590
00:41:12.792 --> 00:41:15.833
Sure, for a couple of feet.
But then we'd die!

591
00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:20.000
Because this is quicksand!
It sucks you under until you die!

592
00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:22.625
That's what it does,
its reason for existing!

593
00:41:22.792 --> 00:41:27.000
Chickenhare is right, we should try.
The quicksand is only in a few spots.

594
00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:29.583
If we avoid them,
we'll have a solid path.

595
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.000
Do you know where that path is?

596
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.333
Follow in my footsteps
and you'll be okay.

597
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.125
I'll go last.

598
00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:42.542
Who's this Uncle Lapin?

599
00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:45.208
Oh, he's just a genius adventurer

600
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:50.583
with grandiose plans most likely
covering a deep-seeded insecurity.

601
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.583
Sounds like someone else I know.

602
00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:56.208
- Chickenhare!
- Oh no!

603
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:58.250
- Chickenhare!
- Abe, help!

604
00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:01.833
Grab onto me.
Darn, I'm a goner too.

605
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.208
Hey, watch the shell!

606
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:05.000
Hold on, Chickenhare.

607
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:08.833
Woah!

608
00:42:09.542 --> 00:42:11.792
Meg! I'm going down!

609
00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.542
Stay still, don't move.

610
00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:24.500
- Woah!
- What are you doing?

611
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:26.125
Grab the whip!

612
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:28.917
With your hands!
Isn't that kind of implied?

613
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.542
Just pull!

614
00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:35.292
Help, Abe! Hurry!

615
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.250
Use your hands!

616
00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:42.958
Isn't it a pretty simple concept
he's failing to grasp? Abe!

617
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:44.458
Ah!

618
00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:56.333
Oh, my gosh!
I'm pulling him out of his skin!

619
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:08.125
Wait, are those… chicken legs?

620
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:10.167
Woah, woah!

621
00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.667
Hold on a second.
Chickenhare… Oh, lightning bolt!

622
00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:16.000
That's where the name
comes from!

623
00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:19.000
Told you I was great at puzzles!
Those are chicken feet.

624
00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:22.708
Woah! You're part chicken,
part hare, aren't you?

625
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:27.292
Hello, what about me?

626
00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:30.667
Hey, a little help here, guys,
I'm stuck.

627
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:39.375
- Do you have other chicken parts?
- No.

628
00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:44.833
- Hey!
- Wow!

629
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.417
That is… awesome!

630
00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:49.750
What else?
Do you have wings?

631
00:43:50.417 --> 00:43:52.125
You have wings under that jacket!

632
00:43:52.292 --> 00:43:56.167
Nope. You've seen the top-shelf stuff.
Just feathers under there.

633
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.375
- Lemme see 'em.
- No!

634
00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:01.542
- Are there other chickenhares?
- Not that I know of.

635
00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:04.917
You're your own species!
How awesome is that?

636
00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:07.000
You're automatically endangered.

637
00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:10.042
- It's not awesome!
- So like what you can do?

638
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:11.958
Oh my gosh, you can fly!

639
00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:14.750
I can't fly.
Chickens can't even fly.

640
00:44:14.917 --> 00:44:17.667
Uh, technically they can over
very short distances.

641
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:20.208
Oh come on,
but you're only part chicken.

642
00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:22.500
How many flying hares
have you ever seen?

643
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.583
Well, none.

644
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.375
But I've also never seen a hare
with such gigantic floppy ears.

645
00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:32.125
- I mean, on an elephant.
- I can't fly!

646
00:44:32.292 --> 00:44:34.375
You can fly!

647
00:44:39.958 --> 00:44:42.083
See, I can't fly.

648
00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:45.250
I can't clear a bar
with my scent like you Meg.

649
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:48.750
There's nothing good
about being me, okay?

650
00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:52.250
Oh… You've got a "me" problem.

651
00:44:54.208 --> 00:44:55.208
Uh…

652
00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:57.625
I think we got a "we" problem.

653
00:44:58.208 --> 00:44:59.875
Oh no!

654
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.250
Ow.

655
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.625
Pigmies?

656
00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:46.583
Oh!

657
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.708
Woah! Heya!
We come in peace.

658
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:53.042
For the record,
I didn't wanna come at all.

659
00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.625
Blast 'em. Blast 'em all.

660
00:45:54.792 --> 00:45:57.417
Hold on, I can't,
I haven't recharged yet.

661
00:45:57.583 --> 00:46:00.500
"Haven't recharged!"
What happened to being special?

662
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:07.542
Hey! That tickles!

663
00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:11.125
Behold! Ooo.

664
00:46:11.292 --> 00:46:12.542
The Chickenhare!

665
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:15.000
God of the land and sky!

666
00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:18.375
Flyer over short distances!

667
00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:20.917
Part chicken, part hare.

668
00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:22.667
Almighty!

669
00:46:22.833 --> 00:46:25.042
Woah.

670
00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:42.167
You are a god?

671
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:43.833
Uh…

672
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.083
Sure?

673
00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:47.625
That's good enough for me.

674
00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:50.042
Prepare the feast!

675
00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.125
See, "me" problem.

676
00:46:52.292 --> 00:46:53.375
Tonight,

677
00:46:53.542 --> 00:46:57.167
we shall ply
the almighty Chickenhare

678
00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:59.917
and his strange helpers

679
00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:02.958
with our finest banquet!

680
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:07.917
And then, tomorrow at first light,

681
00:47:08.083 --> 00:47:10.458
we shall take them to our volcano,

682
00:47:11.583 --> 00:47:14.833
and sacrifice the god Chickenhare

683
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:19.083
to our god…
Santoro the Stoic!

684
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.542
I think you're just the thing

685
00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:26.500
to finally put a smile
on Santoro's face.

686
00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:27.917
Just to be clear,

687
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.625
Chickenhare's the only one
going in the volcano, right?

688
00:47:43.792 --> 00:47:47.500
Nom, nom.
Wow. That meal was incredible.

689
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.708
These guys know how
to throw a sacrifice.

690
00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:53.875
See, Meg, this is what happens
when I'm myself.

691
00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:56.583
Maybe we could take a break
from the pity party?

692
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.292
Let me tell you
about a little skunk named…

693
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:01.083
I don't know… "Peg."

694
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.625
Oh, I love a good story,
especially after a meal like that.

695
00:48:05.792 --> 00:48:08.667
Growing up, nobody wanted
a play date with "Peg,"

696
00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:10.667
on account of her being a skunk.

697
00:48:10.833 --> 00:48:14.917
Even when she got cool new dolls,
and had goody bags for her birthday,

698
00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:16.792
<i>nobody came.</i>

699
00:48:16.958 --> 00:48:19.250
<i>She bathed twice a day,</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

700
00:48:19.417 --> 00:48:22.125
<i>So… she corked herself.</i>

701
00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:23.958
Ouch!

702
00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:25.875
Ouch is right.

703
00:48:26.292 --> 00:48:27.875
But that didn't work either.

704
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:30.917
So naturally, "Peg" got angry…

705
00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:34.125
<i>Her parents had her channel</i>
<i>that anger into positivity.</i>

706
00:48:34.292 --> 00:48:36.542
<i>So, she got a black belt in karate…</i>

707
00:48:36.708 --> 00:48:38.125
<i>and Kung Fu…</i>

708
00:48:38.292 --> 00:48:39.667
<i>and Kendo…</i>

709
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.958
<i>and seven other martial arts.</i>

710
00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:45.542
<i>But that didn't help either.</i>
<i>She was still angry.</i>

711
00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:49.833
<i>Deep down, "Peg" still wished</i>
<i>she was anything but a skunk.</i>

712
00:48:50.167 --> 00:48:53.583
<i>Until the day she went</i>
<i>on a field trip to the Royal Treasury,</i>

713
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:59.083
<i>and then Billy Goat Jones,</i>
<i>the jerk who teased "Peg" the most,</i>

714
00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:01.417
<i>shut the door behind us.</i>

715
00:49:01.833 --> 00:49:04.583
<i>The treasurer was</i>
<i>the only one with the combination.</i>

716
00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.292
<i>What happens</i>
<i>when a skunk fears for her life?</i>

717
00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:10.333
<i>Well, "Peg" was a skunk</i>
<i>who feared for her life</i>

718
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.458
<i>and had been corked for 3 years.</i>

719
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:17.208
<i>"Peg" saved everyone that day.</i>

720
00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:20.375
<i>You were a hero</i>
<i>and everyone loved you, Meg.</i>

721
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.833
<i>Uh, I mean "Peg".</i>

722
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.042
<i>No, they treated me worse than ever.</i>

723
00:49:26.208 --> 00:49:29.000
But for the first time,
I didn't care.

724
00:49:29.167 --> 00:49:33.417
I realized the thing that I was corking,
wasn't something to be ashamed of.

725
00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:35.792
No, it's what made me special.

726
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:39.000
Chickenhare, you're a corker.

727
00:49:39.167 --> 00:49:43.500
Until you blow open your treasury vault,
you won't know what makes you special.

728
00:49:43.667 --> 00:49:46.250
Nice story, Meg,

729
00:49:46.417 --> 00:49:48.500
and I liked the way
you changed your name

730
00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:50.583
to make it feel more universal.

731
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.917
But when the volcano turns us to ash,

732
00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:56.792
it isn't gonna discriminate
between the corkers and the non-corkers.

733
00:49:56.958 --> 00:50:00.167
True. But they're not gonna
throw us in that volcano.

734
00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:01.417
Uh…

735
00:50:01.583 --> 00:50:03.667
- They're not?
- Nope.

736
00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:05.750
Because you're gonna break us out.

737
00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:14.292
- Are you sure about this?
- Trust me.

738
00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:04.333
Chickenhare.

739
00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:13.083
I'll be right back.

740
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.208
No.

741
00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:22.667
Really?

742
00:51:33.292 --> 00:51:35.500
Chickenhare, don't.

743
00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:42.958
You don't need those.

744
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:28.792
Well, you know,

745
00:52:28.958 --> 00:52:33.375
I always felt waiting
'til first light was a bit arbitrary.

746
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.333
Take them to the volcano now!

747
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.667
Put down your weapons,

748
00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:38.833
or your god gets it!

749
00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:40.625
Abe?

750
00:52:41.333 --> 00:52:42.958
Come on, guys, hurry up.

751
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.250
Look how Santoro maintains his stoicism,

752
00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:50.833
even with a spear at his throat.

753
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.208
Let's see how he maintains
his stoicism rolling down a hill!

754
00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:58.458
Now they'll all follow him
as we make our escape…

755
00:53:03.167 --> 00:53:05.625
- Or not.
- Get them!

756
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.333
Oh great Santoro,

757
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.792
your revenge is at hand!

758
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.750
Watch out!

759
00:53:23.917 --> 00:53:26.667
This isn't worth
perpetual three-day weekends!

760
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:30.708
No, come here!

761
00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.875
Woah!

762
00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.583
Tell me you've recharged!

763
00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:57.958
I'm trying! Almost there.

764
00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:06.625
I'm starting to think
you're not special at all,

765
00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:08.167
you just have an enormous ego!

766
00:54:08.333 --> 00:54:10.333
There we go, I'm back.

767
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.708
Fire in the hole!

768
00:54:16.625 --> 00:54:17.625
Ow!

769
00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:24.833
Chickenhare!

770
00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.000
- Chickenhare! This way!
- Coming!

771
00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:53.542
Woah!

772
00:54:58.625 --> 00:55:00.750
Chickenhare!
Your moves have moves.

773
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.083
Good work, Chickenhare.

774
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.250
Did you see that?

775
00:55:25.208 --> 00:55:26.250
Let's go.

776
00:55:29.625 --> 00:55:30.667
Look!

777
00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:33.333
Woah, the mountain!

778
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.042
Incoming!

779
00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:51.250
- Meg, get us across!
- I can't do it.

780
00:55:51.667 --> 00:55:53.500
I can't do it.
Last time I tried…

781
00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:56.250
Last time your jacket
was holding your arm back.

782
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.208
You're almost here, Chickenhare.

783
00:56:03.458 --> 00:56:05.833
- Wow, I did it! Hang on!
- Here we go!

784
00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:08.667
Woohoo!

785
00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:12.875
Oh, please. No!

786
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:17.125
You couldn't have brought
the large whip,

787
00:56:17.292 --> 00:56:18.625
could you, Meg?

788
00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:21.500
I hate adventuring!

789
00:56:25.417 --> 00:56:27.500
Hey! It's even further than I thought.

790
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:50.000
According to the map,
the temple's at the top of the mountain.

791
00:56:50.167 --> 00:56:53.542
We need a plan. Lapin is probably
halfway up there already.

792
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:54.750
I have a plan!

793
00:56:54.917 --> 00:56:57.125
If we take the Nearly Impassable Pass,

794
00:56:57.542 --> 00:57:00.708
by the time the trails merge,
we should be ahead of them…

795
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.708
Sounds like a genius plan to me.

796
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:05.917
We might actually get
that Hamster of Darkness after all.

797
00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:10.333
What do you mean "might"?
Lapin's gonna eat our feather dust.

798
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:12.708
Uh… Abe?

799
00:57:14.417 --> 00:57:16.500
This mud's actually very nutrient-rich.

800
00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:18.542
Uh, let's go.

801
00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:21.625
Hey, I wanna stop Lapin
as much as you,

802
00:57:21.792 --> 00:57:23.583
well maybe 10% as much as you,

803
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.042
but can't we look good doing it?

804
00:57:47.042 --> 00:57:49.083
Here I am. You won't believe it.

805
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.500
Chickenhare's heading up
the Nearly Impassable Pass!

806
00:57:52.667 --> 00:57:54.083
What? Impossible!

807
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:58.000
Huh? No, again I think
it's more improbable than impossible.

808
00:57:58.167 --> 00:58:01.000
You know, I tell you what,
the way he's going,

809
00:58:01.167 --> 00:58:04.583
the Three Deadly Trials
won't be a problem for Chickenhare.

810
00:58:09.583 --> 00:58:11.500
Get the dynamite.

811
00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.458
Come on, Abe!

812
00:58:14.542 --> 00:58:16.083
We're closing in on them.

813
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.625
Hello, I'm a turtle!

814
00:58:17.792 --> 00:58:21.333
Are you completely unaware
of my species' role in fables?

815
00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:29.167
You idiots!

816
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:33.083
The avalanche was supposed
to take out Chickenhare, not us!

817
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.833
It really is difficult
to find good help these days.

818
00:58:42.708 --> 00:58:45.583
Lapin! Lapin!

819
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.458
Look, Lapin's a goner.

820
00:58:49.667 --> 00:58:52.917
- I guess there's nothing we can do.
- Yeah there is.

821
00:58:56.875 --> 00:58:58.417
You're right,
nothing we can do.

822
00:58:58.583 --> 00:58:59.833
Oh, let's go.

823
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.417
Sorry, guys.

824
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:15.083
According to the legend,

825
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:19.250
we're looking for a hamster face
etched in the ice.

826
00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:35.083
I got it!

827
00:59:36.375 --> 00:59:37.583
This way!

828
00:59:47.333 --> 00:59:49.333
Alright, we're going in.

829
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.250
You read my mind, partner.

830
00:59:51.417 --> 00:59:53.958
Wait. Lapin's dead and buried.

831
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:55.833
Probably not in that order.

832
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.792
We saved the kingdom.
We're done here. Let's go home.

833
00:59:58.958 --> 01:00:02.292
Abe, if I can bring back
the Hamster of Darkness,

834
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.167
my dad will let me join
the Royal Adventure Society.

835
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.583
Isn't it enough
that you made it this far?

836
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.542
And who's gonna believe me?

837
01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:12.167
I need the hamster as proof.

838
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.042
Now the only thing
standing between us and it

839
01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:17.042
are the Three Deadly Trials.

840
01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.458
Abe, if you wanna stay behind,
fine, but…

841
01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:22.000
I'm in!

842
01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:28.583
I've always been a follower.

843
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.875
I want every other Thursday off too!

844
01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:41.167
"In order to enter
the Temple of the Hamster of Darkness,

845
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:44.292
one must pass the Three Deadly Trials."

846
01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:48.375
Why's it always three?
Why can't it ever be two trials?

847
01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:53.042
What's the first one?

848
01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:55.792
"We hamsters may be small of stature,

849
01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:57.833
but we are cool under pressure.

850
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.250
We never lose our heads,

851
01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:04.583
"even when confronted
by imminent death."

852
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.500
"Imminent death"!
That's how we start?

853
01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.375
Sadistic little rodents, aren't they?

854
01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:21.375
"Small of stature"…

855
01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:27.000
Ah!

856
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.875
"Cool under pressure"…

857
01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.583
Hey!

858
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.833
A secret passage!

859
01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:44.292
- Well done!
- Let's get out of here!

860
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:47.083
Woah!

861
01:01:57.167 --> 01:01:59.208
What's the second trial?

862
01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:04.250
"Though we hamsters may not be so fleet
of foot to outrun our Destiny,

863
01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:07.042
we do have the courage to face it."

864
01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:10.125
Enough with this fake
self-deprecating routine.

865
01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:13.042
Why couldn't these hamsters
hire shrinks like us?

866
01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:21.458
Run!

867
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.542
Look, that's Ramon's wife!

868
01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:33.667
It's wonderful
that you admire the female form…

869
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:37.125
His wife Destiny.
We have to stand here facing Destiny.

870
01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:39.583
Oh yeah! Or… we can run!

871
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.625
Meg, if you're gonna side with me
once before I die,

872
01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.458
you have 10 seconds.
9…

873
01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:45.625
I'm with Chickenhare.

874
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.958
Uh-oh, miscalculated!
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

875
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:03.125
Woah!

876
01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.417
Oh!

877
01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:31.792
Think these hamsters
had issues with being short?

878
01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:34.875
Do I even wanna ask
what the third trial is?

879
01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:38.625
- All the legend says, is: "Do this."
- Do what?

880
01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.875
That can't be it. Could it?

881
01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:31.292
Man, these hamsters
keep you off-balance.

882
01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:44.167
The scepter…

883
01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:48.208
We made it!

884
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.875
I'm taking you home.

885
01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:13.875
Ah.

886
01:05:15.167 --> 01:05:17.625
The Hamster of Darkness.

887
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.708
- But you…
- Were buried in that avalanche?

888
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:26.583
Or did I make you think I was?

889
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.625
See, I asked myself:

890
01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:33.000
Why should I try to pass
the Three Deadly Trials

891
01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:36.458
when my very eager nephew
would do it for me?

892
01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.667
Give me that scepter.

893
01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.417
Don't give it to him!

894
01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:44.375
You're smart, Chickenhare.
I could use someone like you.

895
01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:48.542
You could be in charge
of my adventure society.

896
01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:50.958
We'll show everyone who laughs at us,

897
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:54.792
take our revenge on those who'd shun us
because we're different.

898
01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:57.292
We're so alike, you and I.

899
01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:00.083
I'm nothing like you.

900
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.167
But you are.
Because Chickenhare…

901
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:04.625
I'm your father.

902
01:06:06.042 --> 01:06:08.167
I'm just kidding.
I'm not your father!

903
01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.625
But wouldn't it
have been crazy if I was,

904
01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.042
right?

905
01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:14.333
Give me that scepter or…

906
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.250
One more step
and I'll throw it over the edge.

907
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.042
Do it and I'll throw your friends over.

908
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.083
Give it to him! Post haste.

909
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:23.958
Do not call his bluff.

910
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:26.458
Prisoners play a lot of poker!
A lot!

911
01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:29.458
If I give it to you,
you'll let them go?

912
01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:31.833
I'll let you all go.

913
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.250
I swear it.

914
01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:35.417
No, he's lying. Ow!

915
01:06:35.917 --> 01:06:39.083
Do you know the final piece
of the legend, Chickenhare?

916
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:43.417
"He who releases the Hamster of Darkness

917
01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.083
shall be followed for all of his days."

918
01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:52.042
That's right, little freak.

919
01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.708
I, Lapin the IX,

920
01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.625
call upon you

921
01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:07.333
to bring the darkness.

922
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.833
What have I done?

923
01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.125
What do you say
we go take back my kingdom?

924
01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:40.625
- What about the freak and his friends?
- I promised I'd let them go.

925
01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:42.958
So, let them go… over the edge.

926
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.958
Darn semantics…

927
01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:55.458
I have good news and bad news.

928
01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:58.167
The bad news is that
you should freeze to death

929
01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:00.750
in about… 12 hours.

930
01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:03.125
Really?
I think it's gonna be quicker.

931
01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.542
What's the good news?

932
01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:07.958
Please be that they're sending
a rope down for us.

933
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.583
The good news is you'll outlive
your father, Chickenhare.

934
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.958
I wouldn't call that good news.

935
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:17.125
Maybe slightly better news…

936
01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:25.500
We found nothing.

937
01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:28.250
It was just another
of my brother's tricks.

938
01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:30.457
Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

939
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:33.167
If Lapin got the scepter,
things could get rough.

940
01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:36.125
Go and take shelter in the dungeon.

941
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:42.292
<i>Dad, I've gone to stop Lapin.</i>

942
01:08:42.457 --> 01:08:45.667
<i>I know I'm not an Adventurer like you,</i>
<i>but I'll try my best.</i>

943
01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.417
<i>I'm sorry for all this.</i>

944
01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.125
<i>I love you, Chickenhare.</i>

945
01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.542
This is all my fault.

946
01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.167
Know what? You're right!

947
01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:01.917
It is all your fault! 100%!

948
01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:04.292
We could've gone home now, but no,

949
01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:06.375
you had to find
the Hamster of Darkness.

950
01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:09.167
- So everyone would forget you're…
- A freak?

951
01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.750
I thought bringing it back
would make them accept me.

952
01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:16.957
It's not all your fault.

953
01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:19.457
It's Meg's fault too.
She's a bad influence.

954
01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:23.042
And I wasn't gonna say "freak."
I was gonna say "Chickenhare."

955
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.332
- Same thing.
- No, they're not.

956
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.875
Look at me!
Why couldn't I just be normal?

957
01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:32.417
Lapin never would've escaped,
and I wouldn't've come here.

958
01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:36.625
Because you're not normal!
Pretending you were only made it worse.

959
01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.917
But when you got rid of that costume
and became you…

960
01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:41.707
You found the hamster.

961
01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:45.250
The treasure no adventurer
could find for thousands of years.

962
01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:47.875
Lapin never would've found it
without you.

963
01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:50.082
I'm trying to let it go,
but I can't.

964
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.000
All of us are born with things
that make us different.

965
01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.792
The only choice we have
is how we see those things.

966
01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:59.958
So, we can either be ashamed of them
or we can embrace them

967
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.833
and see that our differences
make us…

968
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.250
Special.

969
01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:07.458
- No!
- Chickenhare!

970
01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:25.000
Whoop-de-doo!

971
01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:31.792
Woohoo!

972
01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.958
Really?

973
01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:46.125
Come on, Abe.

974
01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.583
They're too far ahead.

975
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.125
When we get to your kingdom,
it'll be too late.

976
01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:54.458
We've come too far.
There's gotta be a way.

977
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.833
- I have a plan.
- You have a plan?

978
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.042
I have my moments.

979
01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:00.917
My secret shame.

980
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.000
I was born without a shell.

981
01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:06.542
This one's my Uncle Herb's…
Love you Uncle Herbie!

982
01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:09.042
Woah!

983
01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.875
What? It's not like I got feathers
growing out of my head.

984
01:11:13.042 --> 01:11:14.458
It's not that.

985
01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:16.583
It's just that, uh…

986
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:19.250
you're really pale.

987
01:11:19.417 --> 01:11:21.708
Eww. That is unattractive.

988
01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:24.417
Eh, anyway, who's ready to ride?

989
01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:30.375
- Should've used less wax!
- Get down!

990
01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.875
- Ow!
- Watch out!

991
01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:41.333
Woohoo!

992
01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:44.250
Alright!

993
01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:46.708
- We're gonna catch Lapin.
- Or not.

994
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.125
I hate adventuring.

995
01:11:59.042 --> 01:12:00.792
Sir, Lapin's at the gate.

996
01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:03.042
He requests to see you.

997
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.667
Let's settle this!

998
01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:15.500
Not another step forward, Brother,
until you tell me where my son is.

999
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.708
You mean that worthless
little half-breed freak?

1000
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.792
He's not coming back.

1001
01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:24.125
I made quite sure of that.

1002
01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:27.208
Hold it.

1003
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:30.500
Brother, please. Where is my son?

1004
01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:36.500
I assume he froze to death on the side
of the cliff I threw him over.

1005
01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:37.667
No!

1006
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:39.250
The scepter?

1007
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.250
That's right! I found it.

1008
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.750
Ah, technically Chickenhare found…

1009
01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:47.458
Enough talk. Hamsters, attack!

1010
01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:49.750
Ah!

1011
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.792
Sounds like a lost cause.

1012
01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.625
My favorite kind.

1013
01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.583
Meg, I'll need your whip.

1014
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.875
Thought you'd never ask.

1015
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.167
We can sneak up on Lapin.

1016
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:32.417
That's a terrible plan,
he's got a million hamsters.

1017
01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.625
Lance, Whitey!

1018
01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.625
Chickenhare!
We thought you were dead.

1019
01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:38.625
Nope. Alive and kicking with these.

1020
01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:40.750
So, where do we stand?

1021
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.542
It looks pretty hopeless.

1022
01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:44.833
We gotta get down there.

1023
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.167
We gotta find a way
to get past those million hamsters.

1024
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.625
With big tails.

1025
01:13:50.167 --> 01:13:52.458
What? I was born without a shell.

1026
01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:55.750
A dose of skepticism
has been essential to my survival.

1027
01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:58.583
That's how we sneak up on Lapin!

1028
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.875
- With my skepticism?
- No, with your shell.

1029
01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:07.042
Well, at least we know your plan's
not the worst one, Whitey.

1030
01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.667
Mine, at long last.

1031
01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:12.292
Oh!

1032
01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:13.917
Perfect fit.

1033
01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:17.542
Actually, I'll need
to have it taken in a little

1034
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:21.208
because you have
such a big fat head, Brother.

1035
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.625
Maybe you're not so perfect
after all.

1036
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What?

1037
01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:33.042
Peg, say hello
to my little smelly friend!

1038
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.750
Hey, Chickenhare's plan worked!

1039
01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:44.167
Woah!

1040
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.667
Chickenhare!

1041
01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:49.625
You?

1042
01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:54.500
Hamsters, I command you to fight no more
and return to the scepter.

1043
01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.167
I mean it.

1044
01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.417
I'm serious.

1045
01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:01.708
I command you!

1046
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:03.958
Please…

1047
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.417
Fool!

1048
01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:10.250
That scepter is nothing without me.

1049
01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:12.917
"For he who releases
the Hamster of Darkness

1050
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:15.833
shall be followed for all of his days."

1051
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.417
The power's already mine.

1052
01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.792
That's not true. Without the scepter,

1053
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.750
he will lose his power.

1054
01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.292
Then I'll get rid of it.

1055
01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:24.833
Hamsters…

1056
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.708
Run, Chickenhare!

1057
01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.083
Attack!

1058
01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:38.167
Argh.

1059
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.375
Oops. Now what?

1060
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:47.667
What are you waiting for?
Break that wall!

1061
01:16:14.292 --> 01:16:17.042
Get the scepter, now,
before he throws it in the pit!

1062
01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.875
Hamsters, the wheel!

1063
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.875
Okay, Chickenhare,
that's how you want to play it,

1064
01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:46.833
then let's do it my way.

1065
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.417
Ow!

1066
01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:03.667
How does it look?

1067
01:17:07.792 --> 01:17:08.917
That wasn't there before.

1068
01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:26.750
Hey rodents,
come and get us if you dare!

1069
01:17:32.792 --> 01:17:35.458
Hi there.

1070
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:09.958
Woah! Look at him!

1071
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:13.292
Get me the scepter
if you want to fly another day.

1072
01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:14.708
Woah!

1073
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.875
Come on!

1074
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.500
Huh?

1075
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.292
Woah, woah, woah!

1076
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.875
Game over, Lapin.

1077
01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:47.333
No it's not,
we're just about to get started.

1078
01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:26.333
Catch me if you can!

1079
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.292
- Let's finish this, Brother.
- Not so fast.

1080
01:19:29.458 --> 01:19:30.500
Huh?

1081
01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:32.458
Argh!

1082
01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.917
Hamsters, charge!

1083
01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:43.000
Finish him, Chickenhare's mine.

1084
01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:22.667
Give me that!

1085
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.375
Good riddance.

1086
01:21:02.083 --> 01:21:03.083
Uncle!

1087
01:21:05.833 --> 01:21:07.208
Uncle!

1088
01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.833
I got you, come on.

1089
01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:29.625
Huh?

1090
01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.583
Chickenhare, no!

1091
01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:34.917
Fly chicken, fly.

1092
01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:36.667
Oh!

1093
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:57.417
If I'm going down,
at least I'm taking you with me.

1094
01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:03.708
What?

1095
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:05.458
Impossible!

1096
01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:08.500
Woah!

1097
01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.250
Woohoo!

1098
01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:36.500
Hey, guys, I'm back!

1099
01:22:36.667 --> 01:22:38.333
Alright, you did it!

1100
01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:40.917
Did you see that? I can fly!

1101
01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:44.333
Nah. I wouldn't call that flying,
more like gliding.

1102
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.750
Ugh. Abe, cork it, will you?

1103
01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:48.125
Chickenhare,

1104
01:22:48.292 --> 01:22:49.542
you found it.

1105
01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:51.833
Yeah, but Lapin took it and…

1106
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.500
Not the Hamster of Darkness,
Chickenhare.

1107
01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:55.875
You.

1108
01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.458
You found you.

1109
01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:01.208
I'm glad.

1110
01:23:02.458 --> 01:23:04.042
Me too, Dad.

1111
01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:05.875
Woah.

1112
01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:08.292
A hare who can fly.

1113
01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:10.000
How cool is this?

1114
01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:13.583
What are you talking about?
He can fly because he's a chicken.

1115
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:15.333
What? He's a hare.

1116
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.542
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1117
01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:17.708
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1118
01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:19.625
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1119
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.417
So what'd I miss?

1120
01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:22.833
Huh? Oh… oh.

1121
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.375
Hey! Hey!

1122
01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.417
What do you want from me?
I just…

1123
01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.458
Chickenhare?

1124
01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.833
Chickenhare.

1125
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.167
I knew it.

1126
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.292
Chickenhare, what are you doing?

1127
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:54.125
Guys, I just discovered the location
of the holy spork!

1128
01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:56.417
We leave in 5 minutes.

1129
01:23:56.583 --> 01:24:00.083
But they're just about to start
bringing out the hors d'oeuvres.

1130
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:01.875
But what about your induction?

1131
01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.042
This is what you've wanted
your whole life.

1132
01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.625
Sorry, don't have time.

1133
01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:09.375
Hold on, Chickenhare.
You can't leave…

1134
01:24:09.917 --> 01:24:11.000
without this.

1135
01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:16.667
Woah!

1136
01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.625
Your golden machete.

1137
01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:20.917
You really mean this?

1138
01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:23.417
I love you, Dad.

1139
01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:28.458
Now, go get that holy spork.

1140
01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:47.792
What are the odds
both of my best friends are masochists?

1141
01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:52.792
Hey!

1142
01:30:53.167 --> 01:30:55.292
