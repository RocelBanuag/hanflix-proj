3
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.617
Ruby!

4
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.426
Hot dog!

5
00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:35.845
Ruby, come get it.

6
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:37.847
Hot dog!

7
00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.233
Oh! Good girl! Good girl.

8
00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.443
Good girl. Oh, Ruby!

9
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.611
Oh!

10
00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.947
And you have a date with a family.

11
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.490
Oh!

12
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.867
Somewhere in you is an adoptable dog.

13
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.953
I know. I know.

14
00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.080
All right. Good girl. Come on.

15
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.811
Oh my gosh! We've got skunk soap.

16
00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.355
Perfect. Thank you. Come on, Ruby.

17
00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:30.775
- She knows a family's picking her up.
- She doesn't want to leave us.

18
00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.485
No, no, no, she doesn't want to leave you.

19
00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.280
Well, I'd take her home,
but my husband would leave me.

20
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.199
All right, come on.

21
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.912
This is serious now.

22
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.456
You've been here six months. Yeah.

23
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.250
You cannot blow this chance.

24
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.419
<i>You've been to seven homes already.</i>

25
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.837
Darn dog!

26
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.465
Ruby!

27
00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.886
Get out of there, Ruby!

28
00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.345
Ruby!

29
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.267
It's time to clean up your act, sweetie.

30
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.686
All right? Come on, stinky.
Let's get you going.

31
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.317
Ah!

32
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.032
- Come on!

33
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.914
Let's hope this placement sticks.

34
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.498
All right.

35
00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.134
- Oh, I washed that.
- I just picked a piece of onion off it.

36
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:21.219
Oh.

37
00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:22.845
Yum, yum, yum.

38
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.057
Come sit with us. I don't even let
my third graders eat while standing.

39
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.101
- I failed third grade. And fourth.

40
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:31.020
- You're exaggerating.
- Oh, you'd have failed me.

41
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.482
Never. You would be my favorite.
Teacher's pet.

42
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:36.901
Bye.

43
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.491
Careful today.

44
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.828
Always.

45
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.332
- Say "Bye, Dada."
- Bye-bye, Dada.

46
00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.215
That boat's
in a good spot there.

47
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:01.884
All right now. That's clear.

48
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.098
- Head down current there.
- Let's go. Seek!

49
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.141
Morning.

50
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:09.851
Morning.

51
00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.645
- It's the K9 unit.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.023
Searching for drugs
tossed out of a vehicle last night.

53
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.608
That's some of Matt Zarella's team
down there. Best of the best.

54
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.569
Like a Navy SEAL Special Ops team.

55
00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.280
300 million olfactory receptors
in their noses,

56
00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.865
compared to six million in people.

57
00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.534
Their sense of smell's
100,000 times more acute than ours.

58
00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:28.786
If we can sense a teaspoon of sugar
in a cup of coffee,

59
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.455
a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar--

60
00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.832
In two Olympic-size pools
filled with water.

61
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:35.918
Yeah.

62
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.422
Uh, Daniel O'Neil. Rhode Island
state trooper, Wickford Barracks.

63
00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.717
Seamus Brady.
Retired maintenance, Scituate Barracks.

64
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.594
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Mm.

65
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.513
Look. Found.

66
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.890
- Bring it in.

67
00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.975
Smooth. Good job!

68
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.893
Excellent work.

69
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.312
I'm gonna be one of those guys
with one of those dogs.

70
00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.399
I gotta, uh… Good to meet you, Mr. Brady.

71
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.860
Bring it in. Let's go, team.

72
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.785
Weather continues to be unseasonably warm.

73
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.662
Not even May, but keep an eye out
for stranded motorists,

74
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.290
carry extra water
for overheating radiators.

75
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:17.001
No matter the heat, hats stay on.

76
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.295
I'm talking to you, Two Towers.

77
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.130
- You got it, Sarge.
- You got it, Sarge.

78
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.218
And of special interest to O'Neil.

79
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.719
It's that time of year.

80
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.972
Tryouts for the K9 academy
are coming up May 15.

81
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.307
Right on, my brother.

82
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.768
Eighth time trying to get in
is gonna be the charm.

83
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.355
Be safe, everyone.

84
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.615
Sarge. Uh, this year's my last chance.

85
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:51.327
The applicants have to be under 30,
and I'm 29.

86
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.162
I'll write the letter of rec again,

87
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.124
but I'm not the one
standing in the way of you trying out.

88
00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.169
It's Zarella. His K9 unit, his academy.

89
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.715
- Come on.

90
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.801
Come on. She'll come.

91
00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:07.927
Come on, Ruby.

92
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.514
Okay, go on. Go. Go on, sweetie.

93
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.015
Go on. Go.

94
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.810
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

95
00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.604
- Oh.
- Aw. She got away.

96
00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.232
Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Okay!

97
00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.984
Go on. Go on.

98
00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.402
- Go!

99
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:25.528
Go on.

100
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.280
Good.

101
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.782
Ah, there you go.

102
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.161
- Come.

103
00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.872
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

104
00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.541
I don't wanna see her back here.

105
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.170
I'll have no choice.

106
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:14.869
Thanks.

107
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:39.684
Excuse me, sir. How many juice boxes
have you had this afternoon?

108
00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:43.813
All right.
License and registration, please.

109
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.733
Mom!

110
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.485
Hey, I was… I was just kidding.

111
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:53.449
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right stuff to…

112
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.825
No. The right temperament.

113
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.620
No, no, no, no. Don't presume
to know what he knows or thinks.

114
00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.996
Daniel O'Neil.

115
00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.041
Like clockwork.

116
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:03.751
Sir.

117
00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.760
All right, sit down.

118
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:15.346
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right temperament,

119
00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.932
that I'm easily distracted,
maybe not much of a reader,

120
00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:21.394
but for the job I think intuitive skills
and people skills are more important

121
00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.145
than being speedy with paperwork.

122
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.564
Plus, I love dogs.

123
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.774
I'm ready for this.

124
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:29.151
I'd really like to try out, sir.

125
00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:34.240
Aren't you qualified
in a bunch of other trooper specialties?

126
00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.535
Yes, sir. I am.
Hostage negotiating, EVOC training,

127
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:40.246
peer-to-peer counseling,
honor guard, boat team, dive team.

128
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:44.333
But K9 is my dream. You know that, sir.
I mean, I think you know that, sir.

129
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.420
Sorry, sir. I don't mean to presume
to know what you know or think.

130
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.799
- I'm a fan.
- Thanks.

131
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:53.968
But also a truth-teller.

132
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:58.222
K9 team requires calm

133
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.141
and focus.

134
00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.811
You're all over the place.
You can't even sit still.

135
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.816
- Who knows where your mind is.
- It's here, sir.

136
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.074
I appreciate the candor

137
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:20.369
and the persistence, but I don't see it.

138
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:25.291
You do this
because you care about people, sir.

139
00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:27.668
The same as me.

140
00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:31.964
You want justice.
You want endings to stories.

141
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.675
Sometimes happy endings.

142
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.011
Sometimes just closure.

143
00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:39.722
The department has no money for new dogs.

144
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:46.103
The German shepherds we use
come from Czech Republic or Germany

145
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.147
and cost over $10,000 each.

146
00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:56.364
I know how much you want this.
How long you've waited.

147
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:05.247
I'm a short guy.
I barely made the height requirement.

148
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:11.420
I had to work twice as hard
to get to the same place as everyone else.

149
00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.674
I'm used to working ten times harder.

150
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.469
Sir.

151
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.474
Danny.

152
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.685
Catch.

153
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.021
<i>We don't have $10,000.</i>

154
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.649
<i>With one kid here and another on the way,</i>

155
00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:33.317
<i>we have our hands full.</i>

156
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:36.946
- Say what you just said again.
- I'm pregnant.

157
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.031
<i>That's great news!</i>

158
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.658
<i> That's great!</i>

159
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.159
Oh, Mel! Oh.

160
00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:44.453
Ma?

161
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.415
K9 dogs live with their officer partners
24/7, right?

162
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.918
It's no trouble at all. They're trained.
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

163
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.422
I'm thinking now maybe
it's not the right time for the K9 thing.

164
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.550
<i>Remember how we were building the deck</i>
<i>when I was carrying Finn,</i>

165
00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:00.302
<i>and you promised a quiet pregnancy</i>
<i>if it happened again?</i>

166
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.556
It's… It's not the right time for K9 unit.

167
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.641
It's the <i>only</i>  time, Mel.

168
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.185
It's a… It's a step up, a raise.

169
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.396
We'll finally be able
to pay off college loans,

170
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.023
save for our kids,
maybe get a bigger house someday.

171
00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:16.986
- So what's the plan?
- I'll get back to you.

172
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.946
<i>- All right. Love you.</i>
- I love you too.

173
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.620
- Hey. Down. Down.

174
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:28.956
She doesn't listen. She's too high-strung.

175
00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:31.584
She chews. She digs. She steals food.

176
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:35.629
She never sleeps. She barked all night.
She's not even housebroken.

177
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:38.090
I know people who train dogs.
I could get you some names.

178
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.551
- I'll pay for it.
- We're not keeping her.

179
00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.720
Maybe you have a kitten?

180
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.769
That dog looks like Ruby, right?
But it's not. It's a new dog.

181
00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:53.647
She's had so many chances.
We can't keep unadoptable dogs.

182
00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.942
- She'll be put down tonight.
- Rick, no.

183
00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:01.530
Ruby's never had a real home.
She thinks this is home. We are her home.

184
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.783
When somebody takes her,
she thinks she's just visiting,

185
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.076
like going to the vet
and we're gonna pick her up.

186
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.455
You know how these dogs are.

187
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.583
Their family drops them off here,
and day after day they just wait,

188
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.752
expecting their person
to come and get them.

189
00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:17.296
They'll wait and wait.
Sometimes they wait a very long time.

190
00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.800
It's heartbreaking.
Ruby just knows how to get back home.

191
00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:25.471
It can take a while before someone
as loyal and loving as a dog

192
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:28.974
can commit to someone new.
Nobody's given Ruby that chance.

193
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.227
- Pat, come on.
- One more day.

194
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.896
I've got people I can call. Please.

195
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.150
You have until the end of the day.

196
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.444
But the vet comes at seven.

197
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.115
<i>No, I wish we could</i>
<i>help you. We can't take any more dogs.</i>

198
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.785
Thank you.
I just thought I'd give you another try.

199
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:48.953
<i>Sorry.</i>

200
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:55.751
Hi, honey.

201
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:59.588
Whoa. Can you just
take Moonlight, please? Thank you.

202
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.048
You can't do this to me. No.

203
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:04.134
No. We got four kids.
And a rescue for each one.

204
00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:07.555
Plus George, and Billie,

205
00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.390
and Barney, and Moonlight.

206
00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.226
<i>- You're killing me.</i>
- Okay.

207
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.108
All right, here we go.
All teams, these three.

208
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:20.901
- Up!
- Good.

209
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.866
Hey.

210
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.618
Hey. Pull up a stool.

211
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.872
What? All right.

212
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.793
- Lot better than sitting home watching TV.

213
00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:40.546
- A beer?
- Root beer.

214
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:44.884
Finest sarsaparilla
with notes of ginger and clove.

215
00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:47.177
Yeah.

216
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.307
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone with
a German shepherd to give away, would you?

217
00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.018
Nope.

218
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.896
I, uh, I need one
to try out for the K9 unit.

219
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:01.984
Don't tell Zarella you heard this from me,

220
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.863
but you don't need a German shepherd.
Not technically.

221
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.699
I've seen it before, up in Mass.

222
00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:12.161
See, what you're needing
is a young, good-sized dog

223
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.288
who's curious,

224
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:16.498
and agile, and has spirit.

225
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.920
And costs nothing.

226
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:23.756
Shoot.

227
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.349
Hi. Um…

228
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.893
I'm looking for a German shepherd.

229
00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.437
You lost one, or are you hoping to adopt?

230
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.065
Um, adopt. Adopt. Sorry.

231
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:43.984
Contact info here.

232
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:46.695
Oh.

233
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.531
Um, okay.

234
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:52.868
Uh…

235
00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:55.788
We don't get many purebreds.

236
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.373
Could be a year or more.

237
00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.042
Um…

238
00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:02.503
All right. Know what?
Thank you. I'm sorry, but--

239
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.254
We got a lot of great dogs.

240
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:07.716
I mean, let me take you out back.
Take a look. You never know.

241
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.260
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

242
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.150
No name tag?

243
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.945
Oh, yeah. That's so weird.

244
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.120
- This one just gets to me.
- How old?

245
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.913
A little more than a year.

246
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.460
- Smart?
- Half Border collie.

247
00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:47.339
There's one named Chaser on YouTube
that knows the names of 1,000 objects.

248
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.510
- You think he could be a K9 dog?
- She could be anything.

249
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.806
- I know, I know.

250
00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:57.433
Come here. Fetch it. Fetch it.

251
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.272
Ruby, right here. Fetch it.

252
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.401
Bring it to me.

253
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.246
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby.

254
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.664
Come here! Come here! Come here!

255
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.125
Bring it to me.
Bring it here. Bring it here.

256
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.130
Good girl. Come here. Bring it to me.

257
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:31.008
Good girl. All right, ready?

258
00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:34.428
- Ruby. Ready? Good girl. I know. I know.

259
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.388
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.

260
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.681
Come on.

261
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.059
Oh, Ruby. Ruby. Ruby!

262
00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:44.563
Come here.
Come here, Ruby. Bring it to me.

263
00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:46.774
Here. Here. Good girl.

264
00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.485
Thank you. Thank you.

265
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.031
Good girl. Thank you.

266
00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:55.824
She's special.

267
00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:01.330
So, are there forms to fill out?
Or… how does this work?

268
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.585
So she's fixed.
She's had her shots.

269
00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:09.046
Anything else you'd like
to ask about her ? Like, her history?

270
00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:09.963
Uh…

271
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.884
I think, uh, you know,
what I see is what I get.

272
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.511
She was a street dog.

273
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.388
Used to scrapping to survive.

274
00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:19.640
All right. Cool.

275
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.143
She's gonna be the first shelter dog
to make the K9 unit.

276
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.228
Um…

277
00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:26.230
Okay.

278
00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:29.691
She's a handful.

279
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.237
Uh, you know, I like a challenge.

280
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.781
- That's for you.
- Thank you kindly.

281
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:37.825
Know what? This is for you.

282
00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.701
Oh! Thanks.

283
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.412
- Some food here.
- Okay. Thank you.

284
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.581
There's goodness in you, okay?

285
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.376
Don't be afraid to let it show.

286
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:50.003
Here we go.

287
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.257
- Oh. Wow! Okay…
- Yep.

288
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.634
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

289
00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:56.844
I'm just kidding. All right.

290
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.846
- All right.
- All right.

291
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:00.931
Thank you. Have a good one.

292
00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:02.558
- Thank you.
- Get the door for you.

293
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.853
- There you go. All right.
- Hold on.

294
00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.355
- See ya.
- Shall we go home? Yeah, come on.

295
00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.529
- She's going with him. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, it's good.

296
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.831
I'd fall apart if I got
that attached to every animal here.

297
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.379
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

298
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.300
All right, Ruby. You ready?

299
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.677
All right. Hold on.

300
00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:41.889
- Hi.
- A dog.

301
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.265
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

302
00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.310
You wanted to know the plan.
This is the plan.

303
00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.354
Hey, no!

304
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:50.564
Ruby?

305
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:01.033
Ruby, hey.

306
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:02.075
Ruby, no.

307
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.287
Okay, Ruby. No. Out… Outside.

308
00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.456
Uh-uh. Outside.

309
00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.333
I'm sorry, honey.

310
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.919
Has Zarella ever taken
a shelter dog in the K9 unit?

311
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.420
Not yet, no.

312
00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:16.256
Ruby, come on. Come on. Hey!

313
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.301
All right. Come on. Come on.

314
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:24.640
Ah! Ruby did that.

315
00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:27.184
Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.145
Oh no, honey. No. Not near there.

317
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.482
Yeah, we're gonna be
doing this for a while, aren't we?

318
00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.567
Yeah, Dad's tired, so…

319
00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.653
Where you going, bud?

320
00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:40.948
- Where you going?
- Read the book.

321
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.366
You want-- The book's right here.

322
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.870
Different book? You need
to pick a different book? All right.

323
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:50.290
Hey, Ruby. Ah!

324
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.294
All right, just… just hold that. Hang on.

325
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.806
Okay, Ruby, come on. Good girl.

326
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.517
- Wait. No.
- No, no, no. No!

327
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.559
No!

328
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.729
- Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
- Ruby. Ruby.

329
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.523
Ruby.

330
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.111
Hey! Come here. No. Yeah.

331
00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:22.739
- Scoot. Yeah. Good girl.
- What are you doing?

332
00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:26.743
She's like a foster kid.
She needs structure and stability.

333
00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.079
You read this?

334
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.040
- Skimmed it, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

335
00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:36.712
I'm so happy about the baby.

336
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.425
Me too. But not about the dog.

337
00:21:41.508 --> 00:21:42.968
Look, she's clever.

338
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:44.803
She has raw talent.

339
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.265
No! Off! Get off!

340
00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:50.726
- Ruby. Yeah, okay. All right.

341
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.979
Come on. Come on.

342
00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:58.400
- I just need to bond with her.
- I know. Maybe just bond out there.

343
00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.651
Yeah, all right.

344
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:01.862
Yeah. Ruby.

345
00:22:02.612 --> 00:22:04.156
- Come on. Come on.

346
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:05.532
Yeah. Hold on.

347
00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:06.950
Come on. No.

348
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.536
- Off, off, off!
- I'm sorry, Mel.

349
00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:12.372
Come on, Ruby. Please. Come on, let's go.

350
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.626
- Yeah.

351
00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:22.549
Okay, Ruby. Your water.

352
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:25.552
Okay.

353
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.640
Come on.

354
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.271
All right.

355
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.691
She'll come around, all right?

356
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.986
She'll come around.

357
00:22:48.075 --> 00:22:49.659
He's sleeping with her?

358
00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:56.333
Hey, O'Neil! Tell your dog to shut up.

359
00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.759
Happy Saturday.
Your wife's gonna love that.

360
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.139
- Hi. Morning…

361
00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:20.023
He's lost his monkey.
It's probably out there somewhere.

362
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.149
Monks.

363
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:26.655
Wow.

364
00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:28.949
The last 18.5 hours
have felt like an eternity.

365
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.202
- Mm.

366
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:34.621
Mel.

367
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:37.707
That's amazing. Mel!

368
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.544
Honey, I… I can't. It's too much.

369
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:43.588
No, yeah, I'm gonna take her
to an obedience class this morning.

370
00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.674
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

371
00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.885
Yeah. I just need to, um,
find one and sign her up.

372
00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:52.431
Perfect. Perfect.
Keep them close.

373
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:53.390
Stop.

374
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:55.350
Wonderful.

375
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.185
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

376
00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.605
Come on. We're going to the library first.
We're going to the library.

377
00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:01.523
Oh boy.

378
00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.025
Sorry. I'm late.

379
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.610
Come in. Come in.

380
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:08.947
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Sorry!

381
00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:13.743
Your dog is aggressive.

382
00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:15.704
It needs socialization.

383
00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:19.708
Yeah.

384
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.545
She doesn't need a class.
She needs medication.

385
00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:26.423
- Ruby! Sorry! Sorry!

386
00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:28.842
Jeez. Unbelievable!

387
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.563
- Ruby. Ruby.

388
00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.982
Hey. You see those dogs out there?

389
00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:45.692
Ruby, you see those dogs out there?

390
00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:48.778
That could be you.

391
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:52.908
I thought you'd be grateful

392
00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:55.785
to have a family, a great job.

393
00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:59.164
Purpose in life.

394
00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:02.000
Excellent. Go ahead and reward him.

395
00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.546
I thought I was good with animals.

396
00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:09.758
I thought we had a connection.

397
00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.470
Getting out? You gonna join me?

398
00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:14.387
Uh…

399
00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:16.348
No, we're, uh…

400
00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:19.851
We're heading back to the shelter.

401
00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:22.521
She's impossible.

402
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:24.356
You know, she doesn't listen.

403
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:27.984
She destroys everything.

404
00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:31.696
You're giving up on her.

405
00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:34.824
Uh…

406
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.245
Who's gonna believe in her if you don't?

407
00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:42.791
Who believes in you?

408
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.877
I've been lucky that way.

409
00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:51.132
Well, maybe that dog
deserves some of your luck.

410
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.395
If you'll try,

411
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:05.855
I'll give you my all.

412
00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.985
Ruby, you see this basket?

413
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.529
All my eggs are in it.

414
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:21.121
Oh boy.

415
00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.959
Where's your leash? Here it is.

416
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.045
Come on.

417
00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:31.756
Wait, Ruby, Ruby.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

418
00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:46.396
I'm sorry, Mel. I couldn't
take her back to the shelter. I…

419
00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:48.857
She loves it here.

420
00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.234
She wants to be our dog.

421
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.153
I know she does.

422
00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:56.948
You do?

423
00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:02.912
- I realized something.
- What?

424
00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:04.539
She reminds me of you.

425
00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.124
Of me?

426
00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:08.293
- I'm nothing like her.
- You are.

427
00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:12.130
You're always busy, always enthusiastic,
going a mile a minute.

428
00:27:12.213 --> 00:27:14.174
Maybe all she needs is routine.

429
00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:16.509
Unconditional love.

430
00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.055
And a crate.

431
00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:27.604
- Thank you.

432
00:27:34.402 --> 00:27:35.236
Monks.

433
00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:40.575
She needs to be a family dog first
and a K9 dog second.

434
00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:43.286
- She can be both.
- Okay.

435
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.080
Welcome to our family.

436
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.226
I don't know if I can take it.

437
00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:07.477
It's heartbreaking.

438
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:12.732
These sites say I've to be the alpha male,
but there are two approaches to training.

439
00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:15.777
Positive with rewards,
or negative with punishment.

440
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.363
Mmm.

441
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.033
Hmm.

442
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.327
The positive one only. Ever.

443
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:27.789
And make sure Ruby knows what you want.

444
00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:32.711
Don't be sad, Ruby. Don't be sad.

445
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.422
- Don't be sad, Ruby.
- I… I can't.

446
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:43.054
You didn't want to pee, huh? Come on.

447
00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:45.306
Did she go?

448
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:47.517
Um…

449
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:50.145
She did.

450
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.480
Just now.

451
00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:57.944
I think she's claiming this as her home.

452
00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:01.072
- Oh, is that what she's doing?
- I believe so.

453
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.075
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

454
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:10.331
You're embarrassing me.
And you're embarrassing yourself.

455
00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:12.292
But you don't even care.

456
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:22.761
See, Ruby? We do this outside.

457
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:25.889
Huh? Wanna give it a try?

458
00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:27.557
Go ahead.

459
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.520
All right, what do you think?

460
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.858
Yeah. Smell that?

461
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.531
Good dog!

462
00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.451
Good girl! Yeah, you did it!

463
00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:48.411
I can't believe that worked.

464
00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:50.288
- All right, sit.

465
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:51.206
Sit.

466
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:53.541
Okay, all right. One thing at a time.

467
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.211
You want this? Want your stick?

468
00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.421
Yeah. You want your stick?

469
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:37.377
Which one of you jokers took my panini?

470
00:30:46.594 --> 00:30:47.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:50.098
I'd like you to see something.

472
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.183
It's off the kitchen video camera.

473
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:53.851
Okay.

474
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.034
You owe me a meatball panini, O'Neil.

475
00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:10.994
Yes, Sarge.

476
00:31:13.288 --> 00:31:16.666
- Ruby, come on. No. Come on.

477
00:31:16.749 --> 00:31:18.334
All right, stay. Stay.

478
00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:20.128
Stay.

479
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.512
Ruby. Ruby.

480
00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:33.975
Be the solution.

481
00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:35.977
Not the problem.

482
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.104
Please, Ruby.

483
00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:03.129
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>we're just trying to condition your dog.</i>

484
00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:04.839
<i>- Click means reward.</i>

485
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:10.011
<i>So what you do now is reward your dog</i>
<i>for doing what you want.</i>

486
00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:11.387
<i>Right? Yes.</i>

487
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:13.848
<i>It's saying, "Yes, I like what you did."</i>

488
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:14.974
<i>"Good dog."</i>

489
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:19.145
<i>Soon your dog will be able to perform</i>
<i>the commands without the click at all.</i>

490
00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:23.858
Sit.

491
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:26.152
Sit, please.

492
00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.531
Sit, Ruby.

493
00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:32.450
Sit.

494
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:34.702
Sit down.

495
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:37.413
Ruby, sit down.

496
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:39.916
Sit down!

497
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.459
Sit.

498
00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:46.130
Maybe I'm deaf.

499
00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:49.509
Or maybe I'm pretending to be deaf.

500
00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.015
- Mel. Can you hear this?

501
00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.559
- 'Cause it's not working.
- Maybe it's the reward.

502
00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:04.607
Hmm.

503
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:12.073
Here we go again.

504
00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:16.327
Hi. Do you remember me?

505
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.037
I… I took Ruby home.

506
00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:20.540
She's not responding to clicker training,

507
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:22.875
and I… I was hoping for some advice.

508
00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:26.754
- You're not bringing her back?
- No.

509
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:30.091
Raw hot dog.
She will do anything for raw hot dog.

510
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.884
I… I should have told you.

511
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.594
Raw hot dog? All right, good.

512
00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:37.140
Uh, yeah.
That's all I needed to know, so thank you.

513
00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:38.141
Thanks.

514
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:42.103
The taller the hat, the closer to God.

515
00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:47.191
- Sit.

516
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:49.569
Good girl! Good girl!

517
00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.903
Good girl. Okay.

518
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:53.322
All right, ready? Okay. Let's do it again.

519
00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:55.366
- Come on. Come on! Sit!

520
00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:57.785
- Sit.

521
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.538
Oh my God! Good girl!

522
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:02.832
Oh my God, you're so good.

523
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:05.293
You're so smart.
All right, come on. Come on.

524
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:07.253
- One more time.

525
00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:09.047
Good girl.

526
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.465
Yep, stay right there.

527
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.011
Come on.

528
00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:17.221
Okay.

529
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:22.185
- Come on.

530
00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:23.268
Go get it!

531
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:25.063
Pick it up.

532
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.023
Good girl.

533
00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:28.065
All right!

534
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:30.610
Come here. Come on. Go get it.

535
00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:37.574
Okay…

536
00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.243
Oh my God.

537
00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:40.995
Home.

538
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:44.498
Ruby, you need an off switch.

539
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:48.002
I could hire you out to the power company.

540
00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:49.587
I could hire you both out.

541
00:34:55.842 --> 00:34:58.763
- Ruby ready for tomorrow?
- She has to be.

542
00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:00.264
Can she sit and stay?

543
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.350
- Everything but.
- Uh-oh.

544
00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.643
- Just like you.

545
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:07.313
- I'm sitting. I'm staying.
- But you're about to go do something.

546
00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:09.774
- I left the hose running.

547
00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:22.745
- Are you nervous?
- Hmm?

548
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:24.038
Maybe just get up.

549
00:35:44.225 --> 00:35:45.768
All right. Come here, Rubes.

550
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.065
Yeah. Good girl.

551
00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:55.695
She loves that.

552
00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:03.286
- I couldn't sleep either.
- Yeah.

553
00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:18.426
I have faith in you.

554
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:21.554
You need to have faith in yourself.

555
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:24.682
Thank you.

556
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.031
Come on.

557
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:55.004
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Hey. Good.

558
00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.881
Sit. Sit. Good.

559
00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:01.594
Morning.

560
00:37:03.971 --> 00:37:06.599
Welcome to the tryouts
for this year's K9 academy.

561
00:37:10.353 --> 00:37:11.604
Who do we have there?

562
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.399
Um… Ruby.

563
00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:17.693
Welcome, Ruby.

564
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.240
All right, dogs in the pen
while we get started inside.

565
00:37:25.368 --> 00:37:28.829
Now, you're not trying out
for the K9 unit today.

566
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:31.582
You're trying out for my class,

567
00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:35.294
which may or may not
qualify you to be a K9 unit officer.

568
00:37:36.003 --> 00:37:37.838
If you are accepted,

569
00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:41.050
these will be six weeks
of rigorous training.

570
00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:44.971
Then you must pass
a final exam for certification,

571
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:48.975
which certifies you to work
in a K9 unit here or in another state.

572
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.226
A final point.

573
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.485
Your dog must have the right temperament.

574
00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.029
So must you.

575
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.119
Search and rescue requires
calm focus and special compassion.

576
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.623
You will deal with people
who are missing loved ones

577
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.125
who might not return.

578
00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:17.795
Ask yourself now,

579
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.923
is this work for you?

580
00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:26.137
Those of you who are sure,
come on outside. Let's see how you do.

581
00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.351
Boden, come on up.

582
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:34.687
<i> Platz.</i>

583
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:37.273
<i>Fuss.</i>

584
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.151
<i>Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!</i>

585
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.570
Ha!

586
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.488
Rather good, Renny.

587
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:49.660
Good boy, Renn.

588
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:50.661
Up!

589
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:56.375
- O'Neil, you're up.
- Okay. Let's go, Ruby. Come on.

590
00:38:58.044 --> 00:38:59.462
Ruby, sit.

591
00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:01.172
Down.

592
00:39:02.798 --> 00:39:03.883
Heel.

593
00:39:07.803 --> 00:39:09.680
Good girl. Good girl.

594
00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:13.392
- Good girl.
- Yay, Ruby!

595
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.270
Come on.

596
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.230
Good girl. Good girl.

597
00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:20.900
Come on. Come on. Yep, yep, yep.

598
00:39:21.484 --> 00:39:23.444
Good girl! Come on.

599
00:39:25.112 --> 00:39:26.113
All right.

600
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.615
Good Ruby. Come on, up!

601
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:31.869
Good job! Come on, come on!

602
00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.371
Up!

603
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.331
Good girl!

604
00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:37.041
Come on. Come on.

605
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:38.584
Come on.

606
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.419
Sit.

607
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.966
Tell her to stay.

608
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.972
When I tell you to stay,

609
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.100
you cannot move, no matter what.

610
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:56.936
Stay!

611
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.442
Pace out ten feet. Do not turn around.

612
00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.697
I had to drop off Finn at my mom's.
What'd I miss?

613
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:09.865
They're passing.

614
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.412
She still has to stay for five minutes
with Daniel ten feet away.

615
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.415
Oh boy.

616
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.753
Stay. Please stay.

617
00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:02.626
- Five minutes.
- Yay!

618
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.004
Good girl! Good girl!

619
00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:10.843
Yeah, good girl. All right, come on.

620
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.430
Now we test all teams

621
00:41:14.513 --> 00:41:16.682
for drive and a good nose.

622
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.769
Search and rescue is…

623
00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.605
Hey, Ruby! Sorry about that.

624
00:41:23.272 --> 00:41:24.565
…serious work for us.

625
00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.984
- Hot dogs?
- This is not good.

626
00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.236
At least it's not a panini.

627
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.988
- No, hey
- But for K9s,

628
00:41:32.198 --> 00:41:34.450
- each mission is a game.
- Stop. Stop.

629
00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:36.869
- Food is what motivates dogs.
- Stop, stop. Down.

630
00:41:36.952 --> 00:41:38.662
That and pleasing you.

631
00:41:39.538 --> 00:41:40.998
- Hey. Stop. Stop.

632
00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:44.001
Just one piece.

633
00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:48.339
Treats are for a job well done.
Not for bribing your dog to behave.

634
00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:54.929
Okay. I know this
will be new to all of you.

635
00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:57.389
I have hidden a human tooth.

636
00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:00.100
Considerate it cadaver material.

637
00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:03.187
It's an exercise
in searching for a dead body.

638
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.314
Today, I want each of you

639
00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:09.235
to scent train your K9
to seek and find that tooth.

640
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:16.075
Me first? A single tooth?

641
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.535
All right.

642
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:23.332
You're gonna teach her to do this
using a unique command.

643
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.001
- "Look for it."
- Okay.

644
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.796
- Stop. Stop it, Ruby.

645
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:32.049
- Ruby, come on. Ruby, stop.

646
00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:34.885
Your dog's not using her thinking brain.
She's not focused.

647
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:37.763
- We'll come back to you. Back in line.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

648
00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:43.936
Peter, your dog's had
some minimal search training.

649
00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.729
Let's show by example.

650
00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:51.360
- Tell him to search.
- Okay.

651
00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:52.820
Look for it. Look for it.

652
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.115
- How does he know what he's looking for?
- It takes time.

653
00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:58.242
But eventually he will learn

654
00:42:58.325 --> 00:43:00.619
to associate that particular command

655
00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:03.330
with finding cadaver material,
once you click and reward him.

656
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:08.252
- Ruby!
- Control that K9!

657
00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:09.211
Yeah. Ruby.

658
00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:10.963
Deepen your voice.
Be commanding.

659
00:43:11.046 --> 00:43:12.006
Ruby!

660
00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.215
Sorry.

661
00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:15.175
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

662
00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.719
Ruby.

663
00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:19.221
Ruby.

664
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:20.514
Ruby!

665
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:23.600
Ruby!

666
00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:28.397
That's a hell of a bark.

667
00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:32.192
Okay, I want you to tell your dogs
to search for him.

668
00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.153
He's a moving target. Let's go.

669
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:46.790
Ruby! Ruby!

670
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.335
Ruby!

671
00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.382
Okay.

672
00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:58.344
Oh boy.

673
00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:05.643
Ruby.

674
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:08.937
Hey, no! No, no, no, no. Hey.

675
00:44:09.021 --> 00:44:11.315
Ruby, put it down.

676
00:44:12.066 --> 00:44:13.484
Put the stick down!

677
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:17.529
- Ruby.
- Good job, everyone.

678
00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:19.239
- Go ahead and reward.
- Ruby.

679
00:44:20.074 --> 00:44:22.660
- Put it down.
- What's she playing with there?

680
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.745
- Um…

681
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.920
Oh! Retreat! Retreat!

682
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.797
Run! Run!

683
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:37.091
Hey. Ruby.

684
00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.634
Come here.

685
00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:40.928
- Ow. Ow!

686
00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:44.139
Ow. Come on. Come on.

687
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:55.234
It's not Ruby's fault.
She's not bred for this work.

688
00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:59.571
She's half Border collie,
one of the smartest breeds.

689
00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:02.032
She hasn't had all the advantages.

690
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:04.827
She's all over the place.
She's not focusing on the tasks at hand.

691
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.703
We're not in the class, right?

692
00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:14.169
- Did everybody else qualify?
- You're good at so many other things.

693
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.756
- You gotta be realistic.
- I am.

694
00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:19.717
Sorry.

695
00:45:34.356 --> 00:45:35.649
So what next?

696
00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:37.818
I'm sorry, Mel.

697
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.571
I wanted this for both of us.

698
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:42.823
For all of us.

699
00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:45.451
A better life.

700
00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:52.082
You know I have a thing for superheroes?

701
00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.544
You wanna be one?

702
00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.840
Dogs have their noses.

703
00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:03.510
I always thought if I had
a partner with a superpower,

704
00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.387
it would cover for my weaknesses.

705
00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:12.478
In trooper academy, you made up
for dyslexia and hyperactivity

706
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.688
with all-nighters and books on tape.

707
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:18.817
Bigger guys than you
hit you hard in the boxing ring.

708
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:20.694
You would not drop.

709
00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:26.074
Then you shattered your kneecap
just before that mandatory race,

710
00:46:26.158 --> 00:46:28.827
and you hobbled
the entire two miles in pain.

711
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.287
I came in last.

712
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.540
You finished.

713
00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.421
Maybe it's not in the plan.

714
00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:43.258
I can't see a path forward from here.

715
00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:48.055
And sheer willpower's not gonna work.
I could push myself but not Ruby.

716
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.228
Yeah.

717
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.356
A-ticka-ticka-ticka. A-ticka-ticka.

718
00:46:57.439 --> 00:46:58.398
Come here…

719
00:46:59.775 --> 00:47:01.109
I know. I know.

720
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.321
House.

721
00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.949
I come bearing gifts.

722
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:11.453
- Are we having a barbecue?
- You chose a dog just like you.

723
00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:14.164
Yeah, you've said that. More than once.

724
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:17.459
You say you hated school.
You didn't want to sit at your desk.

725
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:20.837
- You wanted to run around, not read.
- Reading's not my thing.

726
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:23.757
Teachers underestimated you,
but you have always been smart.

727
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:27.094
No… You didn't get to the point
where you get to the point.

728
00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:29.221
You would've done better homeschooled.

729
00:47:30.055 --> 00:47:31.807
Didn't really have that back then.

730
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.519
Homeschooling would have
appreciated your differences,

731
00:47:35.602 --> 00:47:37.771
your energy, your passions.

732
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:41.358
Encouraging your strengths
instead of focusing on your weaknesses,

733
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:43.735
with lessons tailored to you.

734
00:47:48.156 --> 00:47:49.533
Be right back, buddy.

735
00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.745
- Your mother's a genius.

736
00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.707
Hi, little man. Oh!

737
00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:12.806
Maybe K9 school's not for Ruby.

738
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.851
Maybe what she needs
is one-on-one learning

739
00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:20.022
with a teacher who respects
her unique, special abilities.

740
00:48:21.356 --> 00:48:23.525
More fun, less work,

741
00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:27.571
more quiet figuring things out,
less yelling, right? No bullies.

742
00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:32.451
There's more than one way to pass
that final exam for K9 certification.

743
00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:36.830
Right. I'll use all my vacation days.

744
00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.040
Starting tomorrow.

745
00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:39.124
Baby!

746
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.126
Uh…

747
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:44.171
Doubt there's an audiobook
for this, though.

748
00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:45.756
I'll be your audiobook.

749
00:48:56.683 --> 00:48:57.851
Hey. A-ha.

750
00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.311
- Hi, kid.
- Hey.

751
00:48:59.394 --> 00:49:00.604
What is all this stuff?

752
00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:03.899
K9 dogs have to get used
to seeing gruesome stuff.

753
00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:05.609
- Oh, I get it.
- Come on.

754
00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:07.611
Good!

755
00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:13.450
Find it.

756
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:25.212
Good. Good girl!
You found the phone.

757
00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:29.132
- Good!
- Whoo!

758
00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:36.723
She sure has come a long way. Huh?

759
00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.436
Hey! We're rich!

760
00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:44.439
Whoa! That real?

761
00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:45.440
Yeah.

762
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:49.194
- From my dentist.
- Explain this one more time.

763
00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:52.239
For a missing person, you wouldn't
give Ruby something of theirs to sniff?

764
00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.991
No. She's learning
to seek human scent only.

765
00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:57.619
So she'll know what to search for
based on the command I give her.

766
00:49:57.703 --> 00:50:01.915
It could be something touched by a person,
or it could be a person, dead or alive.

767
00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:05.627
Hey, Daniel. We figured
Ruby could use some socializing.

768
00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:08.588
Our dogs could use it as well.

769
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:09.506
Ah.

770
00:50:10.632 --> 00:50:11.508
Nice.

771
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:25.147
Told ya.
They're all talking about it.

772
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.450
- There you go.
- Thank you.

773
00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:38.827
- Gansett?
- Thank you.

774
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:48.045
- Free burgers, Danny boy.
- That's right.

775
00:50:48.128 --> 00:50:49.755
Free beer!

776
00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:51.548
- You nervous about tomorrow?
- No.

777
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:53.133
- Liar.
- Yep.

778
00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.302
- You want me to come?
- No.

779
00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:58.638
If we fail,
I won't be able to look at you.

780
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:00.515
Okay.

781
00:51:05.187 --> 00:51:08.065
"The K9 certification exam
is given once a year."

782
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:11.485
"It requires handler and K9
to seek three specific items

783
00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:14.237
along an outdoor course in 30 minutes."

784
00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:27.667
Okay, just this once.

785
00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.517
Good girl, Ruby.

786
00:51:45.811 --> 00:51:47.729
The past six weeks have been a journey.

787
00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:51.733
Look who's here. Daniel O'Neil.

788
00:51:52.317 --> 00:51:54.653
Nowhere in your book
does it say we have to take your class,

789
00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:56.279
only pass your final test.

790
00:51:56.363 --> 00:51:59.032
- Yeah. Come on. Let 'em try.
- They've worked hard, earned the right.

791
00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:00.617
I was just gonna say…

792
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:04.412
It's nice to see you back, Daniel O'Neil.

793
00:52:06.581 --> 00:52:08.125
This is how it will work.

794
00:52:08.708 --> 00:52:12.087
Each team will get 30 minutes
to find three things.

795
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.672
Cell phone,

796
00:52:13.755 --> 00:52:15.924
firearm, human remains.

797
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:18.885
First up, Peter and Kohl.

798
00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:22.556
- Could we go first?
- You got a plane to catch?

799
00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:25.100
I'm… I'm just anxious.

800
00:52:25.183 --> 00:52:26.935
They can go. It's fine.

801
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.565
Okay. First up, Daniel and Ruby.

802
00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.066
Come on.

803
00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.360
Test starts out here,

804
00:52:36.194 --> 00:52:37.988
finishes inside.

805
00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:44.244
Your time starts now.

806
00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.204
Okay, seek. Come on. Seek.

807
00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:09.060
She has it.

808
00:53:12.939 --> 00:53:14.858
First object. Cell phone.

809
00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:19.362
- Good job. Keep going.
- Seek!

810
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:45.263
She has it.

811
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.811
Second object.

812
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.188
Firearm.

813
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:57.192
That is two objects
in less than two minutes. Extraordinary.

814
00:53:57.275 --> 00:53:59.402
- Now we head inside.
- Ruby, come on.

815
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.490
Your dogs can relax
until we get back outside.

816
00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:12.290
- Where are they?
- Inside.

817
00:54:14.167 --> 00:54:16.503
- That's not in the manual.
- I know, right?

818
00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.380
But they did really good so far.

819
00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:21.800
Zarella's always got
a trick or two up his sleeve.

820
00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:25.845
All right, Ruby. Okay. All right.

821
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:27.847
Final item.

822
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.766
Human remains.

823
00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:32.769
Right. Now you go on.

824
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.437
Look for it!

825
00:55:41.796 --> 00:55:43.131
Whoa!

826
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:45.884
What the heck?

827
00:55:51.222 --> 00:55:53.850
- It's a big place.
- We blocked off some wings.

828
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.326
Come on, Ruby.

829
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:19.084
What's she telling you?

830
00:56:21.169 --> 00:56:23.880
- There are no remains here.
- Are you sure?

831
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.592
You get one wrong, I can't pass you.

832
00:56:33.098 --> 00:56:35.558
Uh, if she says it's not here,
it's not here.

833
00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:42.440
Well, I guess maybe not everyone's
gonna pass today.

834
00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:46.236
But you and Ruby did.

835
00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:48.571
In record time.

836
00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:50.698
It was a negative search.

837
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:53.868
Sometimes you're gonna be sent for things
that end up not being there.

838
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:55.787
Congratulations!

839
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.623
Good girl. Thank you.

840
00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:00.834
- You've done good.
- Good girl.

841
00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.001
Both of you.

842
00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:06.339
We passed!

843
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:07.799
- Oh!

844
00:57:07.882 --> 00:57:09.509
- We passed!
- Yes!

845
00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.719
- Well done.
- That was great.

846
00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.764
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Hey, Ruby.

847
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:16.224
Great, Daniel.

848
00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:18.560
-  Congrats.
- Thanks. Thank you.

849
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.152
- Great. Good job.
- O'Neil.

850
00:57:28.903 --> 00:57:30.738
I want you to come work for me.

851
00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:32.866
Provisionally.

852
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:36.578
We gotta see if Ruby's as good
in the real world as she was today.

853
00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:38.163
I'd be honored, sir.

854
00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.664
The vest is for her.

855
00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:40.915
Yeah.

856
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:44.252
Stay ready,
and you won't have to get ready.

857
00:57:47.672 --> 00:57:50.383
Hey, how about that, huh?

858
00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:51.759
How about that?

859
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:53.803
Good girl.

860
00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:55.346
Ta-da.

861
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:58.766
Mel, it's too early to party.
I'm provisional.

862
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.143
Be grateful.

863
00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:03.521
- We should've invited Zarella.
- No.

864
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:07.275
I'll take that.

865
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:10.612
Good dog. Come on.

866
00:58:10.695 --> 00:58:11.821
Good, Ruby.

867
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.787
- Find them! Find them!

868
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.502
Good girl!

869
00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:27.879
Good job, Ruby.

870
00:58:33.468 --> 00:58:35.845
- Rube, here we go. Here we go, Ruby.

871
00:58:44.562 --> 00:58:47.148
All right. Yeah, turn, turn.

872
00:58:48.316 --> 00:58:49.526
Turning.

873
00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.320
Look who's here.

874
00:58:52.403 --> 00:58:54.030
Yeah.

875
00:58:55.949 --> 00:59:00.161
Hey, did you know if humans disappeared,
the planet would be better off?

876
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:02.330
But if ants disappeared,

877
00:59:02.413 --> 00:59:04.332
the whole thing
would come apart at the seams.

878
00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:07.710
You're not listening.

879
00:59:09.003 --> 00:59:11.673
Sam, everything's the same,
except for my uniform.

880
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:14.676
The senior K9 teams
are seizing cash from drug dealers

881
00:59:14.759 --> 00:59:16.261
and apprehending suspects. And…

882
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:18.346
I've been sitting on my hands for…

883
00:59:19.847 --> 00:59:21.766
months. The leaves have changed.

884
00:59:21.849 --> 00:59:24.978
Being the junior team
means you wait your turn.

885
00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.444
- You scared of him?
- I am.

886
00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:35.613
Me too.

887
00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:41.828
Who's that?

888
00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:45.665
That's Zarella.
There's a search down city.

889
00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.875
The senior teams are on other calls.

890
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:51.254
- Text me when you find the stash.
- No. It's not stolen stuff.

891
00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:53.256
It's a murder victim.

892
00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.508
I gotta go. Ruby.

893
01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:12.483
All right.

894
01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:14.611
We gotta get this right.

895
01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.739
You good to go?

896
01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.408
Yeah? All right, thank you.

897
01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:25.246
Don't let me down.

898
01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:27.457
Police have a suspect in custody.

899
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.250
There's a missing person
presumed dead here.

900
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:30.960
Right.

901
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.797
Show 'em what you can do.

902
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:35.923
Look for it!

903
01:00:58.112 --> 01:00:59.781
I think she found something.

904
01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:07.413
What you got?

905
01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:09.415
Nothing.

906
01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.042
Yeah.

907
01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.210
It's clean.

908
01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.881
You gotta make the call. Officially.

909
01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.109
No body.

910
01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.465
What…

911
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.803
All right, Ruby.

912
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.058
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

913
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.604
You just blew it, Ruby.

914
01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.692
You blew it!

915
01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.823
Zarella's gonna call
and release me from his unit.

916
01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.784
I'm so sorry.

917
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.745
No, I'm the stupid jerk
Zarella always thought.

918
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:32.874
A guy who doesn't know
his own limitations or his dog's.

919
01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.837
- I'm sorry, Mel.
- I don't care if you're in the K9 unit.

920
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.506
We can manage without the extra money.

921
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.383
I married you, not your job.

922
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.346
My husband has his own superpowers.

923
01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:49.849
His big heart.

924
01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:51.976
His boundless energy.

925
01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:54.729
His ability to hyper-focus on things.

926
01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:57.315
How he forgives.

927
01:02:58.232 --> 01:02:59.567
How he never gives up.

928
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.030
How he trusts
in something bigger than himself.

929
01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:13.122
I'm keeping this one.

930
01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:25.009
Saving the world isn't the goal, love.

931
01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:42.568
Stop.

932
01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.530
Go.

933
01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.793
Ruby.

934
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.549
Ruby.

935
01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:54.473
Ruby, come here, girl.

936
01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:02.273
Ruby.

937
01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:06.444
Ruby!

938
01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:13.367
I'm such an idiot.

939
01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.542
She's gone, Mel. It's my fault.

940
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:24.253
I pushed her. I stressed her.

941
01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:26.631
Then I blamed her for not performing.

942
01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.758
I didn't think she could do it,
and then she didn't.

943
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.968
I mean, so what if she's not a K9 dog?

944
01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.554
She's still a great dog.

945
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.307
She's our dog. All of ours.

946
01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.935
I know.

947
01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.480
I'm gonna find her.

948
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:44.857
Ruby!

949
01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:48.486
Ruby!

950
01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.531
Come here. Ruby!

951
01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:58.829
- Come on.

952
01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.629
Commander, sir.

953
01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.799
We found the body.

954
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.927
We got a tip from a neighbor.

955
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:16.347
Buried under the deck,
covered in three inches of cement.

956
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:18.474
It's a miracle Ruby even caught the scent.

957
01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:21.185
<i>You made the wrong call.</i>

958
01:06:21.727 --> 01:06:23.813
<i>- You should have trusted your K9.</i>
- I…

959
01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.278
Ah.

960
01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.782
Ruby!

961
01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:36.492
Ruby!

962
01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.704
Ruby!

963
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.046
Hi. Have you seen this dog?

964
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.506
Ruby.

965
01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:52.675
Hmm, no.

966
01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:54.009
- Okay.
- Sorry.

967
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.219
Thank you.

968
01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.013
- Bye.
- Thank you.

969
01:06:58.639 --> 01:07:00.933
- Mama.
- Yeah, I know.

970
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.143
Ruby!

971
01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.771
Ruby!

972
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.357
I've got you a hot dog, Ruby.

973
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.483
Hot dog.

974
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.570
Ball Park Frank all the way from Fenway.

975
01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:13.988
Fenway.

976
01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:15.489
Ruby!

977
01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:16.991
Ruby.

978
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.874
Uh, Ruby's run away.
Has she come back here?

979
01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.042
No. I'm sorry.

980
01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.794
Okay…

981
01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:31.005
All right. Thank you.

982
01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:41.223
Uh…

983
01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:49.607
- Uh, sir, I…
- <i> Dan, there's a boy missing.</i>

984
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:52.359
<i>Bring Ruby and meet the unit.</i>
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

985
01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:58.365
- Dan!
- <i>Ruby's not here. She ran.</i>

986
01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:02.244
<i>Well, go get her!</i>
<i>You're no K9 unit without a partner.</i>

987
01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:05.372
Sir.

988
01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:12.797
Uh…

989
01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:14.381
All right.

990
01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:16.759
All right.

991
01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:20.888
All right.

992
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.518
All right.

993
01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.567
Yeah, get in. Get in.

994
01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:39.156
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- Yeah.

995
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.658
- Which way?
- Go! Go!

996
01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.412
- Which way? Where are we going?

997
01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:49.625
I lost my driver's license. Weak eyes.
I need to try that Uber thing.

998
01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.752
Where's Ruby?

999
01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:55.631
I, uh, wish I knew.
I've been looking all day.

1000
01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.426
Dogs don't leave a good thing.

1001
01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.390
I messed up.

1002
01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.935
I didn't trust her.
I… I let pressure get to me.

1003
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:15.024
I did to her what people do to me.
Underestimate me, count me out.

1004
01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.988
- That's why I work harder.
- To prove 'em wrong.

1005
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:20.573
Yeah, you know, to…

1006
01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:23.868
To show I measure up.

1007
01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:28.122
I'm not the stupid hyperactive kid
who couldn't read.

1008
01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:30.957
- And have you proved it?
- Yeah.

1009
01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:33.502
I mean to yourself.

1010
01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:36.714
Sure.

1011
01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:42.761
Turn your blinker on.
Pull over at Katt's here.

1012
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:56.400
I'm thinking you're the one who's lost,
not Ruby.

1013
01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.368
Ruby, where are you?

1014
01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:10.789
Come back!

1015
01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:20.174
You didn't let me down. I let you down.

1016
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:26.013
I'm the one who's gotta change.

1017
01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.268
I have to trust.

1018
01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.521
Really trust.

1019
01:10:41.111 --> 01:10:42.112
My God.

1020
01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:05.678
Ruby?

1021
01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:08.514
I'm sorry.

1022
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.647
There's a missing boy in Glocester.
It's on the news.

1023
01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:18.482
Zarella called.

1024
01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.151
Whole team's mobilized.

1025
01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.993
I didn't believe in her.

1026
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.329
Do you know why?

1027
01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.043
I don't believe in myself.

1028
01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:57.855
Hey.

1029
01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.732
<i>Hey, Danny.</i>
<i>Grinnell's called a meeting.</i>

1030
01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.942
<i>- You gotta get in here.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.

1031
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.825
Glocester boy was hiking yesterday
with his mother in familiar woods.

1032
01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.453
He took a shortcut home alone
and never showed.

1033
01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:20.544
Zarella's K9 unit has been searching.

1034
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.382
O'Neil. Find your K9.

1035
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:32.014
And when you do, put a GPS tracker on her.

1036
01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:34.767
Be safe, everyone.

1037
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.030
Ruby?

1038
01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.701
Ruby! Hey!

1039
01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:53.702
Oh.

1040
01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.498
I never should have thought
you couldn't do it.

1041
01:12:57.581 --> 01:13:00.084
I never should have doubted you. Or us.

1042
01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.718
Let's get you home, all right? Come on.

1043
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:11.762
Ruby, no.

1044
01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.519
You wanna go?

1045
01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:20.687
Let's go to the search.

1046
01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.152
Eat 'em all.

1047
01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.821
Mel. Mel, hey.

1048
01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:32.658
She's back. She's back. I got her.
We're heading to the search.

1049
01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.937
Let's go. Let's go. Good girl.

1050
01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:03.689
O'Neil.

1051
01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.192
You ready? You don't look ready.

1052
01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.945
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Can I count on you?

1053
01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.780
Never more than now, sir.

1054
01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.451
Call everyone back.

1055
01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.454
Set up a perimeter.
I need everyone out of those woods.

1056
01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:20.873
I got my best K9 here ready to go.

1057
01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.626
All right, I want Ruby to pick up
the most concentrated scent.

1058
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.837
It should be the boy's,
not one of our guys'.

1059
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.796
You need a coffee?

1060
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.881
- No.
- All right.

1061
01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.889
All right. Here's where we are here.

1062
01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:40.851
All of this here is nature preserve.

1063
01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:44.188
Dense woods,
granite outcroppings, a thousand acres.

1064
01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:47.483
They started off here, the boy's home.

1065
01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.818
That's the house right behind us.

1066
01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:52.487
They went around and across the pond here.

1067
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:56.658
That's when Michael went off on his own,
presumably to head back home.

1068
01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.577
Best hope is he got lost.

1069
01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.496
The terrain is extremely dangerous.

1070
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.248
Lots of widow-makers.

1071
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.459
My other teams

1072
01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.003
are tired, hungry.

1073
01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:09.505
They're exhausted.

1074
01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.090
He's got very worried parents.

1075
01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.218
I want good news for them.

1076
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.348
I know you can do it.

1077
01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.266
Find him!

1078
01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.990
Don't let one emergency become two!

1079
01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:43.288
- Here, take my hat.
- Okay. Thank you.

1080
01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:47.834
- No one's out there?
- Just you and the boy. Good luck.

1081
01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:49.586
- Good luck, buddy!
- Thanks.

1082
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:33.982
What? What?

1083
01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:40.238
- Good girl, Ruby! Good girl!

1084
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:42.532
All right.

1085
01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:48.038
Good girl, Ruby. Good girl.

1086
01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.628
We have him. We have him down a cliff.

1087
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:55.921
<i>We have him.</i>

1088
01:17:58.465 --> 01:17:59.716
Boy's location?

1089
01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.096
Boy's condition?

1090
01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.556
Daniel.

1091
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.226
He's out of range.

1092
01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:14.398
Michael!

1093
01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:23.031
Michael, I'm coming.

1094
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:25.951
Michael!

1095
01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:30.789
Michael!

1096
01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:35.794
Good girl! Good girl, Ruby.

1097
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:42.175
Good, Ruby.

1098
01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.766
Good girl, Ruby. Good dog.

1099
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.601
Good dog.

1100
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.479
All right, come on. Michael.

1101
01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.524
Michael, can you hear me?

1102
01:18:58.024 --> 01:18:59.067
Good girl. Good girl.

1103
01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.612
Michael?

1104
01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.531
Hey, Michael, can you hear me?

1105
01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:10.036
We got you, bud. We got you.

1106
01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.056
One, two, three, four, five,

1107
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.975
six, seven, eight, nine.

1108
01:19:32.058 --> 01:19:34.060
One, two, three, four,

1109
01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:36.229
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1110
01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:45.864
Hey. Hey, Michael. Hi.

1111
01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.867
Michael, I'm Daniel O'Neil.

1112
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:51.369
This is Ruby, my K9 partner.

1113
01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:57.709
- Cold.
- You're cold? Here.

1114
01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.378
Here, you're cold. Here you go, bud.

1115
01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.005
Here you go. All right.

1116
01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.342
There you go.

1117
01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:07.969
Are you hurt anywhere?

1118
01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.306
- My… My leg.
- Your leg?

1119
01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.809
- This one?
- Ah!

1120
01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.937
Yeah? That hurts? All right.

1121
01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.523
Hang on, bud. We got you.

1122
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.275
Okay? Just stay with me.

1123
01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:27.531
This is 223. We have him.

1124
01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:31.076
Forty-one degrees, 54, 42.4 north.

1125
01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:35.121
Seventy-one degrees, 42, 49.2 west.

1126
01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.125
Good girl. All right, stay with me, bud.

1127
01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:43.004
We have him. Grave condition. Send medics.

1128
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.426
They can't hear me.

1129
01:21:03.733 --> 01:21:05.151
Hear that barking.

1130
01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:10.323
Shut up! Everyone stop talking!

1131
01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:11.366
Listen.

1132
01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:16.663
That's Ruby.

1133
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:23.753
Follow me!

1134
01:21:24.337 --> 01:21:25.547
Let's go. Hurry up.

1135
01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:26.631
Let's go! Let's go!

1136
01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:34.639
Right, keep barking, Ruby. Keep barking.

1137
01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:49.779
This way.

1138
01:21:59.789 --> 01:22:01.249
Careful through the water.

1139
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.047
Please keep barking.

1140
01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:08.757
Just hang with me, bud.

1141
01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.520
- Daniel!
- Hey!

1142
01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.315
- O'Neil, we're here.
- He's alive.

1143
01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:30.070
Hypothermic, possible concussion.
Broken leg, internal injuries.

1144
01:22:30.153 --> 01:22:32.739
- Let's go. We'll get him out.
- All right.

1145
01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:35.158
We're gonna
get you out of here, buddy.

1146
01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:37.035
- Yeah. Just stay with me, okay?

1147
01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.203
Hang in there.

1148
01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.747
Good girl. Good girl.

1149
01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.251
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

1150
01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:49.881
Oh, thank God.

1151
01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:03.687
The boy's gonna need crutches for a while,

1152
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.438
but he's fine.

1153
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.234
- Thank you.
- Well done, son.

1154
01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:17.409
- Thank you for giving me a chance.

1155
01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:19.703
You got it.

1156
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.581
- Couldn't be prouder.
- Thank you.

1157
01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:28.962
We got a very grateful mother here
who wants to say hello.

1158
01:23:29.045 --> 01:23:30.422
Oh, I…

1159
01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:35.093
Wait.

1160
01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:39.055
You're the lady from the shelter.

1161
01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:41.433
<i>You </i>found my son?

1162
01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:42.934
That wasn't me.

1163
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:44.519
It was Ruby.

1164
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:48.189
- She led the way.
- Ruby.

1165
01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:50.316
- Go ahead, girl.
- Oh, Ruby.

1166
01:23:50.942 --> 01:23:54.112
Who's a good girl!

1167
01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.823
Oh, I knew there was goodness in you.

1168
01:23:58.616 --> 01:24:00.577
You all know each other?

1169
01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:05.040
She was supposed to be put down,
and then he came along.

1170
01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.959
You've saved a life, you know?

1171
01:24:08.918 --> 01:24:11.963
And then she saved your son's.

1172
01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:15.508
- Wow.
- Now there's a wink from above.

1173
01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:18.511
- Mrs. Inman?
- Oh, I think they're calling you.

1174
01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:22.682
Thank you.

1175
01:24:23.516 --> 01:24:24.350
Thank you.

1176
01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.315
Trooper O'Neil.

1177
01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:34.944
You're official.

1178
01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.490
Promoted to full status K9 unit.

1179
01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:48.041
- Thank you.
- Told you he'd come through for you.

1180
01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:49.959
You did.

1181
01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:53.213
But you had him help me?

1182
01:24:54.839 --> 01:24:56.341
He's my best scout.

1183
01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:00.553
Scout?

1184
01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.099
Matt's always been rooting for you.

1185
01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.189
All right, Ruby. Come on.

1186
01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.191
- Thank you, officer.
- Sure. Have a good morning.

1187
01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.108
Thank you.

1188
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:19.948
Hey, Mel. What are you…

1189
01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:21.366
Aw.

1190
01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:29.207
Wow, Daniel.
Unbelievable, man. Great work.

1191
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.501
- Thank you.
- Well done, Dan.

1192
01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:33.795
- Here's your hat.
- Oh! Thanks for the hat.

1193
01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:35.004
Anytime.

1194
01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:37.006
- Incredible work. Incredible search.
- Thank you.

1195
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.508
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

1196
01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:40.760
I…

1197
01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:50.812
What?

1198
01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:54.941
I'm just happy.

1199
01:26:07.203 --> 01:26:08.288
There you go.

1200
01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:17.440
Get in there, Bear. Come on.

1201
01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:18.942
Bear. Bear.

1202
01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:21.945
Bear, come. Get in there!
In the pool. Bear!

1203
01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.363
- Go on.
- Bear. Come!

1204
01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.241
- Bear.
- Come on. Good!

1205
01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:30.119
- Bye, Dada.
- Bye, Mama. Bye, Mama.

1206
01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:32.205
- Bye, Dada.
- Bye, Mama.

1207
01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.249
Bye, Mama.

1208
01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.794
- Get off!

1209
01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.005
Stay.

1210
01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:43.758
Sit.

1211
01:27:43.841 --> 01:27:46.219
Sit. Stay.

1212
01:27:47.845 --> 01:27:49.055
Stay. Good!

1213
01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:50.056
Adding dog.

1214
01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.769
Hailey, can you say anything
that'll make him react?

1215
01:27:54.852 --> 01:27:57.188
Like, can you speak lizard?

1216
01:27:58.314 --> 01:28:00.316
- Bye, Dada
- Bye, Mama.

1217
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.234
Dada.

1218
01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:03.778
Bye, Mama. Bye, Mama.

1219
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:04.821
"A" mark.

1220
01:28:04.904 --> 01:28:07.323
Pick it up, pick it up!
Bear, Bear, Bear!

1221
01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:11.452
- Bear! Bear! What are you doing?

1222
01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:13.371
You useless mutt!

1223
01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:14.831
- Bear!
- No, that's good.

1224
01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:16.040
Good!

1225
01:28:17.917 --> 01:28:20.128
Reward your dog for doing what you want.

1226
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:22.880
It's like saying,
"Good dog. I like what you did."

1227
01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.674
"Now you get a treat."

1228
01:28:24.757 --> 01:28:26.592
- Soon you'll be able to…

1229
01:28:27.927 --> 01:28:30.304
…train your dog without the click at all.

1230
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:31.389
- Good boy.

1231
01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.224
- That good?

1232
01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:36.102
- Oh!

1233
01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.230
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1234
01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.273
Mmm.

1235
01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:42.025
Bye-bye, Dada.

1236
01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:44.444
Bye-bye, Dada. Bye-bye, Dada.

1237
01:28:44.527 --> 01:28:45.737
Bye-bye, Dada.
