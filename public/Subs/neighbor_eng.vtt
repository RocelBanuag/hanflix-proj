00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.879
- David Stevens?
- Yeah.

2
00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:47.964
You from Riga?
It's my first time.

3
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:53.136
Love the, uh, the architecture.
It's so beautiful here.

4
00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:35.444
Good to see you,

5
00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:36.713
you old rattlesnake.
Ohh!

6
00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.313
- David, how you doing?
- Grant!

7
00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.116
Good. How was your flight, man?

8
00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.652
- Oh, it was good.
- Good!

9
00:03:42.654 --> 00:03:46.522
So the, uh, painters are
behind on your apartment,

10
00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:48.991
but they assure me they'll
be out in a few weeks,

11
00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:51.393
and then we can get
you closer to town.

12
00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.663
No, it's... it's
fine. Really, Grant.

13
00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:56.566
But it still needs a lot
of work, the exterior.

14
00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.202
I think it's... I think
it's beautiful, really.

15
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.403
I like it.
Good. Well, the office

16
00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:03.371
is walkable from the train,

17
00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:06.241
and there's a train
station very close by.

18
00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:08.711
Or else you could
use my other car,

19
00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:12.014
which is in the, uh,
garage, if you need to.

20
00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.850
You'll get the lay of the land.

21
00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.350
You know, I just
want to say thank you

22
00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.853
for setting this
up, Grant, really.

23
00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:19.522
It's... I'm excited for
some change, you know?

24
00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.591
Well, don't be too excited.

25
00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.359
I need you to serve
as a swing writer.

26
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.328
I know it's a step
down for you now,

27
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.197
but, uh, we'll get
you into the system,

28
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.233
and we'll go from there.
Okay. That's...

29
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.568
Yeah, that's no problem.
I'm here to work.

30
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.238
You know me. Alright.

31
00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:16.813
Excuse me. Sorry, I'm lost.

32
00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.950
Hi. I'm David.
David Stevens.

33
00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:24.989
Uh...

34
00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.325
Your desk is over there.

35
00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.597
Thank you.

36
00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:37.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

37
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.140
Hey, how you doing, man?
Good.

38
00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.408
Yeah? Alright.

39
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.444
So, you met Iris? Hmm?

40
00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:52.782
- Yeah, I did.
- She's amazing.

41
00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:54.851
I mean, if you're looking.

42
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.254
Noted.

43
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.122
Oh.

44
00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:39.328
Come on.

45
00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:08.257
Hi.

46
00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.326
I'm sorry to bother you. Um...

47
00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.666
Hello. I'm Robert.

48
00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:18.034
Oh, you're British.

49
00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:19.869
Yeah, my mom was. I
went to school there.

50
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:22.538
- Okay.
- And you're a hamster.

51
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.674
Is that what I said?

52
00:07:24.676 --> 00:07:27.710
Yeah.

53
00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:29.578
How can I help you, David?

54
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.213
Uh, I can't seem to
get my car started.

55
00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:33.883
I was wondering if you had a
gas can that I could borrow.

56
00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:35.751
Oh, I think I can do a
little bit better than that...

57
00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:37.119
Give you some actual gas.

58
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:39.388
Come in.
Oh. That's amazing. Thank you.

59
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.223
Excuse the mess.

60
00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:44.894
Do you want a beer or something?
Oh, no. Maybe another time.

61
00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.530
I just really want to
get the car sorted.

62
00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:49.464
Right.

63
00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:04.380
Here you go.

64
00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:06.282
Alright. Thank you.

65
00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:07.883
Did you catch that?

66
00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:10.086
- Yes, I did.
- Huh.

67
00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:12.121
- You fish?
- Oh, no.

68
00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:15.057
As a kid, uh, I wasn't
very good at it.

69
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:17.293
Okay, uh, thank you...
Welcome.

70
00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:18.661
For this.

71
00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:21.564
Look, I will return this
full tomorrow, I promise.

72
00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:24.667
No problem. I know
where you live.

73
00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:27.505
Right?

74
00:08:38.182 --> 00:08:40.448
Come on, you piece of shit.

75
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.425
Alright.

76
00:08:49.427 --> 00:08:51.095
What the fuck?

77
00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:57.166
David, do you need a hand?

78
00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:59.468
Hey. Um...

79
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.139
Yeah.

80
00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:06.142
- The fuse box is good.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:08.644
Are you a mechanic?

82
00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:10.146
- Me?
- Yeah.

83
00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:11.480
I'm a nurse.

84
00:09:11.482 --> 00:09:13.816
I work for a mobile
nursing unit.

85
00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:16.952
- Wow, that sounds rewarding
- It's an odd job, really.

86
00:09:16.954 --> 00:09:20.790
A lot of people come to Riga
to die. It's nice like that.

87
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:23.459
What about you?
I'm a journalist, yeah.

88
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:25.529
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.229
Have you written
anything I've read?

90
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:30.666
No, probably not.
Just mostly U.S. news.

91
00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:34.504
Okay. Try it now.

92
00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:37.673
Take it for a ride,

93
00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:41.043
let the gas go through.
Yeah.

94
00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:43.145
Hey, uh, I'm not
really good with cars.

95
00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:45.815
You want to go for a spin in
case this bad boy breaks down?

96
00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:48.317
Alright.

97
00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:04.200
Car sounds good.

98
00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:06.335
Mm-hmm.

99
00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:08.204
So did you come here alone?

100
00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.905
Yeah, just me.

101
00:10:09.907 --> 00:10:11.541
No wife, no
girlfriend, nothing?

102
00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:14.376
Nah.

103
00:10:14.378 --> 00:10:15.711
No, we're done, you know?

104
00:10:15.713 --> 00:10:17.279
It's kind of the
reason why I'm here.

105
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:19.915
- I'm sorry. Fuck.
- No, that's alright.

106
00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:22.885
Yeah, she...

107
00:10:22.887 --> 00:10:25.788
She dumped me because I
wasn't ready to get married,

108
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.291
and then she ran off
with my best friend.

109
00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:32.562
I don't think he
was your <i>best</i> friend.

110
00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:35.631
Yeah, I guess not.

111
00:10:35.633 --> 00:10:40.069
You know, from suffering
comes happiness.

112
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:43.072
You have to believe
you'll be alright.

113
00:10:43.074 --> 00:10:45.474
The universe will
take care of the rest.

114
00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:46.876
Mm.

115
00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:50.580
Or something. I mean,
what the fuck do I know?

116
00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:53.415
No, I like that, I like that.

117
00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:56.285
Hey, that's good. You know,
you're a good guy, man.

118
00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:24.947
- Come in.
- Hey.

119
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:26.516
- Hey!
- So I'm going to head out.

120
00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:29.785
Uh, I sent you that
money laundering piece.

121
00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:31.787
Great. Great.
I-I'll have a look.

122
00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:33.623
Okay, cool.

123
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:38.628
Hey, uh, if you're up for
it later, drinks, my treat.

124
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.263
Oh, shit. I'm sorry,
I would love to,

125
00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:44.200
but I got this, uh, phone
interview from Boston.

126
00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:47.036
It's probably going to go late.
Okay. Sure. It's no problem.

127
00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.471
- Take a rain check.
- Yeah.

128
00:11:49.473 --> 00:11:51.340
See you tomorrow.

129
00:11:51.342 --> 00:11:53.309
<i>Pieces of leaves
with their jaws.</i>

130
00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:56.278
<i>The are transported
back to the nest,</i>

131
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.516
<i>where they are processed
into a nutritional substrate</i>

132
00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:02.785
<i>for their subterranean
fungus gardens.</i>

133
00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:06.322
<i>It's this symbiosis between
the ants and the fungus</i>

134
00:12:06.324 --> 00:12:10.826
<i>that appears to be rewriting
the insect evolution.</i>

135
00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:12.728
<i>But we still don't...</i>

136
00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.179
- David.
- Hey.

137
00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:32.047
- Hey.
- What are you up to?

138
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:33.882
- Watching TV.
- Yeah?

139
00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:35.585
You wanna go grab a drink?
Now?

140
00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:38.354
Yeah, I owe you a drink for
helping me with the car, so...

141
00:12:38.356 --> 00:12:40.690
Alright.

142
00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:43.327
I'll throw something on.
Okay.

143
00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:12.054
To the universe.

144
00:13:12.056 --> 00:13:14.624
Yeah, the universe.

145
00:13:16.728 --> 00:13:20.229
Hey, listen, I've read a
couple of your articles.

146
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:22.898
You write well.
Thank you.

147
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.034
Thank you for reading.
Yeah.

148
00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:27.570
Doesn't make you feel good?
No.

149
00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:29.706
Cheers.

150
00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:59.937
I'll have another
one. Thank you.

151
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.443
I'd like a drink. What is it?

152
00:14:06.477 --> 00:14:09.813
It's called a
short trip to hell.

153
00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.782
Short trip to... I
like the sound of that.

154
00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:15.286
Want a sip?

155
00:14:17.988 --> 00:14:21.591
One's good, but the second,
you might regret it.

156
00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:24.293
Well, I'll buy the
next round, then.

157
00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.429
This is my... third, I think.

158
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:30.700
I'm David.

159
00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:32.868
- Janine.
- Janine?

160
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.804
I like your bracelet, Janine.

161
00:14:34.806 --> 00:14:37.640
That? Just my cycling ID.

162
00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:39.609
- What?
- It's for my bike.

163
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:41.009
I cycle everywhere.

164
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:44.213
It's got emergency
contacts and stuff.

165
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:46.350
American?

166
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:49.284
Mm-hmm.

167
00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:52.121
I'm just here for work.
What brings you to Riga?

168
00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:54.022
- Soul searching.
- Ah, soul.

169
00:14:54.024 --> 00:14:56.992
I'm from London originally.

170
00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:59.461
Um, are you with anyone?

171
00:14:59.463 --> 00:15:02.030
I met some friends
earlier, but they've gone.

172
00:15:02.032 --> 00:15:04.503
What about you?
Yeah.

173
00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:10.005
A friend. He's here somewhere.
Yeah, sure.

174
00:15:10.007 --> 00:15:12.908
You don't have to make things
up. You're better than that.

175
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.578
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Convince me.

176
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.413
Come on.

177
00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:19.074
You've got my number. Call me.

178
00:16:19.076 --> 00:16:22.444
I'll buy you another
drink... Water, anything.

179
00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:26.618
Another time. I have to get up
early in the morning for work.

180
00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:29.921
Don't go.

181
00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:35.123
Yes?

182
00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:36.726
Now you got my number.

183
00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:38.828
Right.

184
00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.503
Uh, yes.

185
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:49.606
I'm sorry to leave you hanging.

186
00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:52.274
I just met the
most amazing girl.

187
00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:53.442
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

188
00:16:53.444 --> 00:16:54.844
- Did you get her number?
- I did.

189
00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:56.946
Good. Let's go.

190
00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:08.123
Do you want to go for
another beer or something?

191
00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:10.025
I got to work tomorrow.
I wish I could.

192
00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:26.308
I don't think you should
smoke in this car.

193
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.144
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, it's all good. Here.

194
00:17:31.115 --> 00:17:33.317
Alright.

195
00:17:35.185 --> 00:17:36.819
Mm.

196
00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:38.655
Do you know how to work this?

197
00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.524
No, that's the wrong
button. Oh, shit.

198
00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.060
Watch out!

199
00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:55.672
David, we hit something.

200
00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.740
What?

201
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.098
Shit.

202
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.200
J-Janine?

203
00:18:25.202 --> 00:18:27.870
Janine? What the fuck?

204
00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:30.240
What the fuck?

205
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.211
Move away.

206
00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:37.747
Robert?

207
00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.784
She's not breathing.

208
00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:50.292
Ooh, come on. Come on.

209
00:18:50.294 --> 00:18:53.228
- Robert, what's wrong with her?
- Come on, babe.

210
00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:17.587
She's dead, David.
Shit. Shit.

211
00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.555
Shit, shit.

212
00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:21.924
- David, I'm sorry, mate.
- Oh!

213
00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.760
Shit!
David, David...

214
00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:26.963
David, I'm sorry, David.
Oh, God. Fuck. Oh, God.

215
00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:29.666
Oh, God, it can't be.

216
00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.601
She can't be dead.

217
00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:34.804
Why are you driving your bike
down the middle of the road?

218
00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:38.007
Why is there no
fucking bike path?!

219
00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:39.274
Please.

220
00:19:39.276 --> 00:19:42.111
Why don't you just
wake up? Wake up.

221
00:19:42.113 --> 00:19:44.479
David, we need to leave now.

222
00:19:44.481 --> 00:19:47.617
- We got to call for help.
- We can't call anybody.

223
00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:51.087
You've been drinking.
This is murder.

224
00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:56.125
David, we have to go.

225
00:19:56.127 --> 00:19:58.628
Now, David!

226
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:03.599
Oh, fuck.

227
00:20:05.503 --> 00:20:07.136
David!

228
00:20:07.138 --> 00:20:08.336
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:10.274
I'm so sorry.

230
00:20:12.143 --> 00:20:14.544
I'm sorry.

231
00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:12.869
We should have
called the police.

232
00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:16.939
This could have
happened to anyone.

233
00:21:16.941 --> 00:21:19.244
Yeah.

234
00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.045
But it didn't.

235
00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:26.015
It happened to me.

236
00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:29.218
And it happened to her.

237
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.622
It happened to us, David.

238
00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:35.191
Look...

239
00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.860
I know this girl shouldn't have
been riding her bike in the dark

240
00:21:37.862 --> 00:21:39.562
with no light on.

241
00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.463
But if you report this,

242
00:21:41.465 --> 00:21:43.933
nothing's going to
change for that girl.

243
00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.269
You can't undo it.

244
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:49.304
But what you <i>can</i> do is move on.

245
00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:52.909
What's past is past.

246
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:55.580
Don't let this ruin us.

247
00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.750
Alright?

248
00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:03.920
Relax.

249
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.337
So where are we?

250
00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:18.741
Okay.

251
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.143
Right. Kiel?

252
00:26:21.145 --> 00:26:24.480
Yes. Police have
concluded the investigation

253
00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.715
into the murder of...

254
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:34.690
Okay. That, uh, leaves us
with the hit-and-run yesterday.

255
00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:37.593
Cyclist found dead.

256
00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:40.229
Uh, David, that would be you.

257
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:42.698
Any questions?

258
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.569
Great. Let's get started.

259
00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:47.436
Happy Friday.

260
00:26:47.438 --> 00:26:50.208
Thank you.

261
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.587
Ohh!

262
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.574
Hey!

263
00:29:37.576 --> 00:29:40.411
You speak English?

264
00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:43.379
Yes.

265
00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:46.549
You were at the
press conference.

266
00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.052
I'm one of the journalists.

267
00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.788
They're saying
they have no leads.

268
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.558
I-I don't understand.

269
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.129
Did you know her?

270
00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.931
She's my sister.

271
00:30:02.933 --> 00:30:05.635
I'm not even meant
to be here yet.

272
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.469
We... We have kayaking.

273
00:30:07.471 --> 00:30:11.040
I'm sorry. I have to go
back... Back to the office.

274
00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:14.910
Hey! Will you write...

275
00:30:14.912 --> 00:30:16.445
in... in your article,
will you write

276
00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:19.917
that we need witnesses
to come forward?

277
00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.818
- You did what?!
- I took care of our problem.

278
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.686
And what did you do with it?

279
00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.622
Do you really want to know?

280
00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:02.493
It's gone... for good.

281
00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:07.096
I was at the police station
for the news conference.

282
00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:09.632
- Uh-huh.
- The girl's sister was there.

283
00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.034
Whose sister?

284
00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.336
Who do you think?

285
00:31:14.338 --> 00:31:16.806
Janine's sister.

286
00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.007
She wants to know what happened.

287
00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:21.511
Of course she does.

288
00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.513
What do the police know?

289
00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:25.648
Nothing...

290
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.718
far as I can tell, for now.

291
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.452
Good.

292
00:31:32.022 --> 00:31:34.492
- Robert?
- David?

293
00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:40.663
It's not too late
to turn ourselves in.

294
00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.634
Yes, it is.

295
00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:46.536
Do you know how many years
you'll get for a hit-and-run

296
00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:49.171
in Latvia?

297
00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:52.074
Do you want to go
to prison here...

298
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.811
as an American?

299
00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:56.981
I wouldn't.

300
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.853
Goddamn it.

301
00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:06.689
What do we do about the car?

302
00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:09.091
Wait 'til tomorrow
and report it stolen.

303
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:12.428
Look suspicious if
you did anything else.

304
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.231
Shit.

305
00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:26.676
That night, you and
I went into town.

306
00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.044
But we didn't drive.

307
00:32:29.046 --> 00:32:31.113
We went to a bar.

308
00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.583
We had a few drinks.

309
00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:36.084
We left the bar at 12:15

310
00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:39.622
and took a tram at 12:30.

311
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.891
Remember?

312
00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:44.627
Got it?

313
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.395
Good.

314
00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:50.199
We have to protect each other.

315
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:54.305
We have to rely on each other.

316
00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.754
Come on.

317
00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:13.590
It's beautiful, isn't it?

318
00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:14.891
Mm-hmm.

319
00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:20.295
You ready?

320
00:33:20.297 --> 00:33:23.098
Let's get involved.

321
00:33:35.412 --> 00:33:37.580
Oh, st-stay calm.
What do I do? What do I do?

322
00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.849
- Let him have the hook.
- Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.284
Whoo!

324
00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:44.286
Whoa!

325
00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.655
Wow!

326
00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:47.757
Bring it in, bring
it in, bring it in.

327
00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.859
Come on.
You got it?

328
00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.831
You are blessed.

329
00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:02.972
What are you doing?

330
00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:06.141
Jamie Oliver trick.

331
00:34:06.143 --> 00:34:09.146
Oh, yeah.

332
00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:13.183
- You want a drink?
- No, I've tea, thanks.

333
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:22.190
Sorry about the smell.
It's alright.

334
00:34:22.192 --> 00:34:23.826
I'd have cooked it outside,

335
00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:26.330
but my barbecue's broken.

336
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:36.507
Do you collect these?

337
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:41.076
Excuse me.

338
00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:44.847
Please... don't do that.

339
00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:47.552
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

340
00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:58.193
My mother used to
leave them for me.

341
00:34:58.195 --> 00:35:00.429
She went away.

342
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:05.169
W-What do you mean, went away?

343
00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:10.707
You got a drink? Let's eat.

344
00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:27.058
Yes, Officer, that is correct,
I'm not the owner of the car.

345
00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:31.460
Okay, so he has to be the
one to report it was stolen.

346
00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:34.731
Okay. I will tell him.

347
00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:38.402
Thank you.
David, you have a visitor.

348
00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:43.138
Hi. Um, I don't know
if you remember me.

349
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.207
I'm Janine Rafael's sister.

350
00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:47.209
Yes. How can I help you?

351
00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.645
I'm Vanessa.

352
00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:51.146
You wrote that article
about my sister,

353
00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:54.149
about how the police
have no leads.

354
00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.918
Yes.

355
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.420
I wanted to speak to you.

356
00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.923
The police, they're not moving
very quickly, and, uh...

357
00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:05.762
You know, I-I really
have a deadline to finish.

358
00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:07.396
Um, okay.

359
00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:10.165
Uh, maybe a drink after work?

360
00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:12.804
Um, my schedule
is pretty packed.

361
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:18.810
Look, I think I know
how to catch the killer.

362
00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:26.281
This is the highway
from Dzintari to Riga,

363
00:36:26.283 --> 00:36:28.518
which is the fastest
route from the club.

364
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.954
And this is the back road
where my sister died.

365
00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.123
- Right.
- What if someone

366
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.291
was deliberately
avoiding the highway?

367
00:36:36.293 --> 00:36:38.427
You know, most people
have driving habits.

368
00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:40.129
A road they'll
take during the day

369
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.198
they will also take at night.

370
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.870
What if they'd drunk too much?

371
00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:49.471
Still could have been
coming from Dzintari

372
00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:51.440
taking the back roads.

373
00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.810
- But that's a much longer trip.
- Look, all I'm saying is

374
00:36:53.812 --> 00:36:58.650
that there are many reasons why
someone might take that road.

375
00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:05.322
So you're not going to help me.

376
00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:10.660
I'll do what I can. Look,
let the police do their job.

377
00:37:10.662 --> 00:37:14.165
You know, these
things take time.

378
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.569
Yeah.

379
00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:26.142
Is someone

380
00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:29.848
helping you through all this?

381
00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:36.819
My dad died when
we were younger.

382
00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:41.726
And my mom died
a few years back.

383
00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:47.331
Janine was all I had.

384
00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:54.036
Look, please.

385
00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:57.339
I need answers.

386
00:37:57.341 --> 00:38:00.676
I don't know what else to do.

387
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.084
I'll see what I can do.

388
00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.290
Sorry.

389
00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:16.893
Thank you.

390
00:38:43.288 --> 00:38:45.924
Alright.

391
00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.761
Do you know what?

392
00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:54.831
The best fishing I've
ever done is in Ludza.

393
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:58.134
I mean, it's beautiful. It's
not far from here, actually.

394
00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:01.438
Fish just hop out of the water.

395
00:39:02.941 --> 00:39:06.275
Do you know what? I think we
should go together, you and I,

396
00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.810
to Ludza.

397
00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.612
I've got a mate up there
who rent apartments.

398
00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:11.080
Not expensive or anything.

399
00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:13.649
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit.

400
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:16.085
Let me have a look at it.

401
00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:22.024
What are you doing?

402
00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:25.296
- I'm sucking out the infection.
- Stop it!

403
00:39:27.966 --> 00:39:29.832
I'm sorry.

404
00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:32.469
There's Band-Aids in the box.

405
00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:46.115
Look, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to upset you.

406
00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.684
It's fine.

407
00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.887
No, it's a problem.

408
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.289
- Robert?
- What?

409
00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:56.826
I have killed a woman.

410
00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:59.195
Yes.

411
00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:02.064
But you of all people should
know how this world works.

412
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.634
What the hell does
that even mean?

413
00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:06.736
You worked as a
journalist in New York.

414
00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:09.171
And -Bad things happen to
good people all the time.

415
00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:11.173
Get over it.
How about you

416
00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:15.044
take care of your own shit,
and I'll take care of mine?

417
00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:17.213
Okay.

418
00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:19.882
If I did that, you'd be in jail.

419
00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.353
- Okay, how... how do you spell...
- You just need that,

420
00:40:57.355 --> 00:40:59.588
that...

421
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.358
David, you got a second?

422
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.393
Uh, yeah.

423
00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.897
That's fine. I'll finish. Yeah.

424
00:41:07.899 --> 00:41:10.533
- So you're settling in?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

425
00:41:10.535 --> 00:41:13.468
Well, I met the guy
who lives next door.

426
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.538
- Oh.
- Do you know anything about him?

427
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.739
- Rob... Robert?
- Mm-Hmm.

428
00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:18.274
Something like that?

429
00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:19.909
Oh, well, neighbors told me

430
00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:22.244
that his mother was
an airline stewardess,

431
00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:25.948
used to leave him alone for
weeks and weeks as a kid.

432
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.050
He's an odd bird.

433
00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:29.954
But...

434
00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:34.924
Is everything alright?
I'm... I'm...

435
00:41:34.926 --> 00:41:36.959
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm just working.

436
00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:40.429
Okay. That's good to hear.

437
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:44.266
By the way, I'm, uh, thinking
of taking off this weekend.

438
00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:48.104
I'm going to go to the Baltic
Pride Festival in Vilnius.

439
00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:52.174
Probably, uh, need to swap
cars so we can all fit.

440
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.578
Oh, shit. I forgot
to... To tell you.

441
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.780
I've been having trouble
keeping the car running.

442
00:41:57.782 --> 00:41:59.782
I was going to call a
mechanic, have him come out,

443
00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:02.184
take a look at it.

444
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:05.121
Uh, just, you know, a
little gift from me to you.

445
00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:07.023
Everything you've
done, you know?

446
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:10.126
Don't worry about it. I'll get
one of the boys to drive us all.

447
00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:12.028
No problem.
Right. Whatever's easiest.

448
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.330
You know?
No. All good. Okay.

449
00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:15.798
Alright.

450
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.504
I'm good, by the way.

451
00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:12.188
- You got a new car?
- Hey.

452
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.324
Yeah, it's just a rental.
Nice.

453
00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.394
And you got a new grill.

454
00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:20.530
This is for you, actually.

455
00:43:20.532 --> 00:43:22.731
- For me?
- Yeah.

456
00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.034
David...

457
00:43:25.036 --> 00:43:27.670
I know your old one messed up,

458
00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:30.673
so I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

459
00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:33.843
Oh, please, mate. Forget it.
I mean, I will take the grill.

460
00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:35.411
Can't believe you remembered.
Yeah.

461
00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:38.214
How about we fire it up
tonight for dinner? Sound good?

462
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:39.415
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

463
00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:40.749
I'll fire it up about 8:00.

464
00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:42.751
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks, David.

465
00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.286
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

466
00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:47.591
Wow. I can't believe
you bought me a present.

467
00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:02.972
Hello?

468
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:06.543
Hi, Vanessa, it's
David Stevenson.

469
00:44:06.545 --> 00:44:08.310
Hey.

470
00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:10.813
Um...

471
00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:15.251
Just calling to see
how you were doing.

472
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:17.920
Well, good, actually.

473
00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:19.755
Detective Reine called.

474
00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:22.628
A witnesses just came forward.

475
00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:26.596
Really?

476
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.237
- David.
- Robert, listen.

477
00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:37.173
A witness came forward.

478
00:44:39.611 --> 00:44:43.445
Some old lady who lives by
the road called the police.

479
00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.481
Have they been to see her yet?

480
00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:48.284
No. I'm sure they will today.

481
00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:51.954
Listen to me. There's
no need to panic.

482
00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:54.290
You find out what they know.

483
00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:56.694
I'm sure it's nothing.

484
00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.546
Hey.

485
00:46:23.548 --> 00:46:26.415
Thanks for coming so quickly.

486
00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:27.717
Come in.

487
00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:29.954
Take a seat.

488
00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:37.560
So witness came forward.

489
00:46:37.562 --> 00:46:39.729
Detective Reine is on her way.

490
00:46:39.731 --> 00:46:43.365
Maybe now they'll catch the
piece of shit who did this.

491
00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:46.068
I don't know how
people sleep at night.

492
00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:54.577
I'm sorry. Can I
get you a drink?

493
00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:56.546
Yeah. Sure.

494
00:46:56.548 --> 00:46:57.982
Okay.

495
00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:19.669
Hello?

496
00:47:53.605 --> 00:47:56.138
The witness...

497
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.141
s-she had a heart attack.

498
00:47:59.143 --> 00:48:01.511
She didn't make it.

499
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.824
I'm so sorry.

500
00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:33.342
- David.
- You will not believe this.

501
00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:37.079
The old lady, the witness,
she had a heart attack.

502
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:40.082
Okay. That's good.

503
00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:43.118
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

504
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.489
What time you coming over?

505
00:48:46.725 --> 00:48:48.525
Um...

506
00:48:48.527 --> 00:48:51.728
Hey, I'm really sorry to do
this. I'm way behind at work.

507
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.195
Yeah, yeah, sure.

508
00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:55.665
Come over whenever you
want. Don't sweat it.

509
00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:59.437
No, I'm not going to be able
to make it. I'm really sorry.

510
00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:02.605
Are you sure?

511
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:05.542
I've got a lot of
really nice food here.

512
00:49:05.544 --> 00:49:07.276
Be a shame to waste it.

513
00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:10.713
I'm just, uh... I got to
finish this... this piece,

514
00:49:10.715 --> 00:49:12.414
and they pushed my deadline.

515
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:14.684
So I'm stuck here
all night, really.

516
00:49:14.686 --> 00:49:17.085
Yeah, yeah. Sure,
sure. Go, go, go, go.

517
00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:19.622
Do your job, mate.
Yeah, no problem.

518
00:49:19.624 --> 00:49:21.624
- I'm really sorry.
- See you later.

519
00:49:21.626 --> 00:49:23.760
Bye.

520
00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:14.142
Hello.

521
00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:16.946
I'm looking for David.

522
00:50:16.948 --> 00:50:18.915
David Stevens?

523
00:50:18.917 --> 00:50:20.282
Yes.

524
00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:22.117
We were meant to have a
barbecue this evening,

525
00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.486
and he called me and
said he had to work late.

526
00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:26.421
So I thought I'd bring
the dinner to him.

527
00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:29.124
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Grant.

528
00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:31.961
I'm, uh... I'm one
of the editors here.

529
00:50:31.963 --> 00:50:34.496
You... You look very familiar.

530
00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:38.100
I don't believe we've met.
I live next door to David.

531
00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:39.468
- Robert!
- Yes.

532
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.337
Yes. Well, we have met.
I... I own the house.

533
00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:44.607
Oh, I'm sorry. I
didn't recognize you.

534
00:50:44.609 --> 00:50:49.344
Yeah. Well, um, David left
about a half an hour ago.

535
00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.146
He said he was going to
go down to Main Street,

536
00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:55.150
get some sushi, and then,
uh, come back, finish up.

537
00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:59.054
But, uh, I mean,
it... It smells nice.

538
00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:03.392
Why don't you enjoy
it, while it's warm?

539
00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:06.061
Oh, well, that's
very sweet of you.

540
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.800
It's my pleasure, Grant.

541
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:20.743
So did you always know
you wanted to be a writer?

542
00:51:20.745 --> 00:51:23.378
Uh, yeah, sort of.

543
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.683
My mother used to say she
always knew when I was a kid

544
00:51:26.685 --> 00:51:30.185
because I'd have all these
random questions, you know?

545
00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:32.689
Like, here's one...

546
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:35.390
Why is there a
"D" in "fridge"...

547
00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.192
Think about it...
Mmhmm.

548
00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:40.195
And not "refrigerator"

549
00:51:58.917 --> 00:52:01.718
So I didn't ask you...
What do you do for a living?

550
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.721
Mm. Graphic designer.

551
00:52:04.723 --> 00:52:06.889
Wow, very cool.

552
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:10.292
It's good because I
can work from anywhere,

553
00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:14.063
but London is home.

554
00:52:14.065 --> 00:52:16.733
So you married?

555
00:52:16.735 --> 00:52:18.735
No.

556
00:52:18.737 --> 00:52:20.103
Almost.

557
00:52:20.105 --> 00:52:25.541
We were together six years,
but it just didn't work out.

558
00:52:25.543 --> 00:52:27.577
You?

559
00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:31.148
On the mend from
a recent split.

560
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:35.051
Sorry to hear that.

561
00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:44.259
Hey, last piece is yours.

562
00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.796
No, it's yours. I insist.

563
00:52:50.135 --> 00:52:52.001
I insist.

564
00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.678
Sorry.

565
00:53:01.112 --> 00:53:02.277
Mm-hmm.

566
00:53:04.149 --> 00:53:07.182
Well, thanks for a nice evening.

567
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:09.952
- Yeah. You're welcome.
- I needed that.

568
00:53:09.954 --> 00:53:13.357
What the fuck?

569
00:53:14.926 --> 00:53:16.693
Shit.

570
00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:19.829
Who would do
something like this?

571
00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:27.804
I'm... I'm sorry.

572
00:53:27.806 --> 00:53:29.641
Uh...

573
00:53:30.975 --> 00:53:32.809
Can I give you a ride home?

574
00:53:32.811 --> 00:53:37.649
It's okay. I'm only like a
five-minute walk from here.

575
00:53:39.984 --> 00:53:42.319
Thanks.

576
00:53:44.989 --> 00:53:47.023
Mm-hmm.

577
00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:49.892
Have a good night.
You, too.

578
00:53:52.664 --> 00:53:54.664
Great.

579
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.669
Fuck me.

580
00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:13.576
Hey, Robert, it's,
uh it's David again.

581
00:55:13.578 --> 00:55:15.545
Been trying to reach you

582
00:55:15.547 --> 00:55:18.614
Just give me a call
when you get this.

583
00:55:18.616 --> 00:55:19.916
Bye.

584
00:55:27.125 --> 00:55:28.825
Hi.

585
00:55:28.827 --> 00:55:30.595
Uh, Vanessa. Hi.

586
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.832
I'm sorry for I-intruding.

587
00:55:35.834 --> 00:55:41.070
I went to your office, and
they said you were here.

588
00:55:41.072 --> 00:55:44.439
I wanted to give you
these to say thank you

589
00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:48.580
for being so helpful,
for listening to me.

590
00:55:49.848 --> 00:55:54.016
Thank you. Uh, you
really sh-shouldn't...

591
00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:56.453
Please.

592
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:59.757
Okay.

593
00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:05.360
Can I come in?

594
00:56:10.434 --> 00:56:14.704
Janine and I, we
weren't really speaking.

595
00:56:14.706 --> 00:56:21.443
We got into this huge fight
in Greece last summer.

596
00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:24.649
And she left to come here.

597
00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.486
Just so stupid.

598
00:56:32.857 --> 00:56:38.027
I just wish I'd done
more to resolve things.

599
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:40.665
I feel so guilty.

600
00:56:43.134 --> 00:56:45.534
And I miss her.

601
00:56:45.536 --> 00:56:48.137
I really miss her.

602
00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:50.673
God.

603
00:56:52.877 --> 00:56:55.513
I'm... I'm sorry.

604
00:56:56.547 --> 00:56:58.981
No, it's okay.

605
00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:15.099
Okay.

606
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.368
Hey, I didn't know
if you wanted some...

607
00:57:46.731 --> 00:57:50.900
So cheerful, bright.

608
00:57:50.902 --> 00:57:53.536
Beautiful.

609
00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:58.708
Much too early to be called way.

610
00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:02.044
She was the best chef,

611
00:58:02.046 --> 00:58:04.580
the best colleague,

612
00:58:04.582 --> 00:58:07.750
the kindest person at all.

613
00:58:07.752 --> 00:58:11.287
May she... rest in peace

614
00:58:11.289 --> 00:58:17.460
and... have freedom... forever.

615
00:58:17.462 --> 00:58:20.631
Janine and I had
been through so much.

616
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.633
We were always there
for each other.

617
00:58:24.635 --> 00:58:28.270
It's amazing to see
that she found her tribe

618
00:58:28.272 --> 00:58:30.773
in such a beautiful place.

619
00:58:30.775 --> 00:58:32.775
To Janine.
To Janine.

620
00:58:32.777 --> 00:58:34.777
- To Janine.
- To Janine.

621
00:58:34.779 --> 00:58:37.847
I'm so sorry, Vanessa.

622
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:48.457
Hi. Thank you for coming.

623
00:58:48.459 --> 00:58:51.160
I'm sorry for your loss.

624
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.938
Where were you?

625
00:59:03.174 --> 00:59:05.975
- What?
- Were you at the memorial?

626
00:59:05.977 --> 00:59:09.111
Yeah, I had to
cover it for work.

627
00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:12.116
Why was Vanessa Rafael
at your house last night?

628
00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:16.352
Are you spying on me now?

629
00:59:16.354 --> 00:59:19.388
Her Uber turned around in
my driveway and woke me up.

630
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.291
Have you read this?

631
00:59:22.293 --> 00:59:24.160
David!

632
00:59:24.162 --> 00:59:28.197
The sister, David. The
bloody woman is dead!

633
00:59:28.199 --> 00:59:31.000
And you want to go play
therapy with the sister.

634
00:59:31.002 --> 00:59:33.503
What are you trying
to be, David?

635
00:59:33.505 --> 00:59:36.072
Her rock?

636
00:59:36.074 --> 00:59:38.176
Look...

637
00:59:40.678 --> 00:59:44.013
All I've ever asked of
you is your loyalty.

638
00:59:44.015 --> 00:59:45.848
I need to know I can count...

639
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.918
I'm not going to
tell her a damn thing.

640
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.719
Trust me.

641
00:59:54.892 --> 00:59:57.728
Eventually, she
finds out everything.

642
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.531
Women always do, David.

643
01:00:01.533 --> 01:00:04.168
Then what?

644
01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:43.873
Well, that's about
it, then, I guess.

645
01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:47.577
Um, no questions, uh,
have a good weekend.

646
01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:49.745
- Have a nice weekend.
- Thank you. Bye.

647
01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:00.923
Uh, Henry, could I
speak to you a second?

648
01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:03.593
How's David doing?

649
01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:07.062
Well, actually, he missed
a couple of deadlines.

650
01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.598
A couple?

651
01:01:25.483 --> 01:01:28.117
Hey. How you doing?

652
01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:32.957
Yeah, you know, I'm just,
uh, really swamped at work.

653
01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:37.760
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

654
01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:40.698
Are you sure you're okay?

655
01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:47.772
I don't think we should
do this anymore, Vanessa.

656
01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:59.882
We met because of Janine.

657
01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:03.152
Don't you think some
good can come of that,

658
01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:07.323
some light after
all this darkness?

659
01:02:07.325 --> 01:02:10.392
Could be a chance
for both of us.

660
01:02:59.377 --> 01:03:01.210
Yeah? Grant here.

661
01:03:01.212 --> 01:03:03.212
Hello. This is Officer Pavlows.

662
01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:05.582
I'm calling about
your stolen car,

663
01:03:05.584 --> 01:03:08.685
a 1984 BMW.

664
01:03:08.687 --> 01:03:10.553
My stolen car?

665
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.459
David?!

666
01:04:23.695 --> 01:04:25.961
Hey, there.

667
01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:18.213
So nice.

668
01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.683
Mm-hmm.

669
01:05:20.685 --> 01:05:23.354
- I'll go get the kayaks.
- Okay.

670
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.670
- Thank you very much.
- Take care. Have fun.

671
01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:41.704
There's a really
nice point to stop

672
01:05:41.706 --> 01:05:43.573
if you want to stop
for a romantic lunch,

673
01:05:43.575 --> 01:05:46.208
hang out and have a drink. Yeah.
Cool.

674
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.410
Other than that, the
lake is beautiful.

675
01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:51.213
- Thanks.
- What are you doing here?

676
01:05:51.215 --> 01:05:53.516
- You know each other?
- Yes.

677
01:05:53.518 --> 01:05:55.919
How do you know each other?
This is Vanessa.

678
01:05:55.921 --> 01:05:57.887
We're friends from work.

679
01:05:57.889 --> 01:06:00.255
Vanessa, this is my neighbor.

680
01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.191
Oh, I'd like to think I'm
a little bit more than that.

681
01:06:02.193 --> 01:06:05.394
I'm his friend... Robert.
Pleasure to meet you.

682
01:06:05.396 --> 01:06:08.363
- Have we met?
- Oh, I think I'd remember.

683
01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:11.066
I think our kayaks are ready.

684
01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.202
Okay. Nice to meet you.

685
01:06:13.204 --> 01:06:16.205
And you, Vanessa.

686
01:06:16.207 --> 01:06:18.908
What the fuck are
you doing here?

687
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.078
Kayaking.

688
01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:31.654
There you are.

689
01:06:31.656 --> 01:06:33.890
What a beautiful day.

690
01:06:33.892 --> 01:06:36.425
Not too hot, not too humid.

691
01:06:36.427 --> 01:06:38.962
I somehow imagined
this differently.

692
01:06:38.964 --> 01:06:41.931
Hey, Robert, uh, do you mind

693
01:06:41.933 --> 01:06:44.266
giving us a little
bit of privacy?

694
01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:47.069
I'll find a good spot, and
I'll leave you two alone.

695
01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:49.772
By the way, special occasion?

696
01:06:49.774 --> 01:06:54.409
My sister and I used to do this
trick before she passed away.

697
01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:57.179
We thought we'd do
it to celebrate her.

698
01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:00.417
God, that's awful. I'm
so sorry. What happened?

699
01:07:02.687 --> 01:07:04.486
She was hit by a car.

700
01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:06.288
A car?

701
01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.925
That's not the girl
in the newspaper?

702
01:07:08.927 --> 01:07:10.292
Robert.

703
01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:11.628
They still haven't
caught him, right?

704
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.797
- Robert, please. Please.
- That man's a pig.

705
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:17.600
I can't believe that bastard.
Leave a beautiful girl like that

706
01:07:17.602 --> 01:07:20.371
dying in the street
like an animal.

707
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.205
Vanessa! Vanessa!
Vanessa!

708
01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:25.644
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

709
01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:29.480
Vanessa! Robert!

710
01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:34.149
Son of a bitch.

711
01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:54.671
Motherfucker.

712
01:08:00.545 --> 01:08:02.679
Aah!

713
01:08:21.533 --> 01:08:23.066
Robert!

714
01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:36.845
Oh, my God.

715
01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:50.026
David!

716
01:08:50.028 --> 01:08:51.928
David! Here!

717
01:09:18.756 --> 01:09:20.555
I got you.

718
01:09:20.558 --> 01:09:22.326
I got you.

719
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:27.063
Hey.

720
01:09:27.064 --> 01:09:28.430
Hey.

721
01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:30.933
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

722
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.674
How you doing? You okay?

723
01:09:36.808 --> 01:09:38.743
Thanks.

724
01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:43.078
I saw...

725
01:09:43.081 --> 01:09:46.115
I thought I saw...

726
01:09:46.117 --> 01:09:48.752
I thought Robert...

727
01:09:50.822 --> 01:09:52.590
Robert what?

728
01:09:55.827 --> 01:09:58.127
Nothing.

729
01:09:58.129 --> 01:10:01.097
Doesn't matter.

730
01:10:01.099 --> 01:10:03.702
I'm just glad it's over.

731
01:10:17.182 --> 01:10:19.882
How is she? Is she alright?

732
01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:22.618
She... She almost
drowned, Robert.

733
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.319
What the hell is wrong with you?

734
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:25.655
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

735
01:10:25.657 --> 01:10:27.056
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

736
01:10:27.058 --> 01:10:29.625
Do you think this is
some kind of game, huh?

737
01:10:29.627 --> 01:10:31.994
You come down here.
You insult her.

738
01:10:31.996 --> 01:10:33.996
You embarrass me.

739
01:10:33.998 --> 01:10:36.165
Insult her?

740
01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:38.400
Embarrass you?

741
01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:42.406
You killed her sister.
You're doing the insulting.

742
01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:47.744
You know, Robert, why
don't you just leave?

743
01:10:47.746 --> 01:10:49.547
Or what?

744
01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:54.150
- Or what?
- Yeah.

745
01:10:54.152 --> 01:10:56.353
Or what?

746
01:10:58.022 --> 01:11:00.890
I got this under control.

747
01:11:00.892 --> 01:11:03.391
I know you do.

748
01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.762
Of course.

749
01:11:05.764 --> 01:11:07.866
I'm sorry.

750
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:34.291
Mr. Stevens?

751
01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:37.760
I'm Detective Reine.

752
01:11:37.762 --> 01:11:40.096
Yes, I know who you are. I
was at the press conference.

753
01:11:40.098 --> 01:11:42.430
Ah. Oh.

754
01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:45.034
What a coincidence.

755
01:11:45.036 --> 01:11:47.236
How are you?
Good.

756
01:11:47.238 --> 01:11:49.272
Is there news about my sister?

757
01:11:49.274 --> 01:11:51.473
No. Sorry.

758
01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:54.646
Actually, we are here to
talk with Mr. Stevens.

759
01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:59.582
- Please have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

760
01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:00.917
Can I get you
something to drink?

761
01:12:00.919 --> 01:12:03.820
No. Actually, the
reason we are here

762
01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:07.422
is you reported your
car stolen, Mr. Stevens.

763
01:12:07.424 --> 01:12:10.492
- Yes. Well, technically, it's not my car.
- Mm.

764
01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:13.428
We know. Our officer tried
to confirm the owner,

765
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.463
but he hasn't returned the call.

766
01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:19.602
I think he's on a getaway with
some friends for the weekend,

767
01:12:19.604 --> 01:12:21.436
yeah.
Huh.

768
01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.606
You reported the
theft on Saturday,

769
01:12:23.608 --> 01:12:25.775
after the hit-and-run
last week, yeah?

770
01:12:25.777 --> 01:12:28.611
Yeah, on Saturday. It
might have been Friday.

771
01:12:28.613 --> 01:12:32.315
- Small details, right?
- I think it was Saturday, yes.

772
01:12:32.317 --> 01:12:35.284
Let me ask you something.

773
01:12:35.286 --> 01:12:38.754
Thursday night, where were you?

774
01:12:38.756 --> 01:12:42.024
- Thursday night?
- Yeah.

775
01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:43.491
Um...

776
01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.695
Teritorija bar.

777
01:12:45.697 --> 01:12:48.297
Was Ms. Rafael there, as well?

778
01:12:48.299 --> 01:12:52.134
No. No, we... met
at your briefing.

779
01:12:52.136 --> 01:12:54.772
No, I mean, <i>Janine</i> Rafael.

780
01:12:55.506 --> 01:12:58.975
I'm sorry. Uh, what...
What is this about?

781
01:12:58.977 --> 01:13:01.644
I don't understand.
Ms. Rafael's phone records.

782
01:13:01.646 --> 01:13:05.982
You called her that
night at, uh... at 11:28?

783
01:13:05.984 --> 01:13:08.653
That must be a mistake.

784
01:13:11.856 --> 01:13:13.823
I did make a call
that night at the bar.

785
01:13:13.825 --> 01:13:17.994
There was a woman, and she wrote
on my arm, and then she left.

786
01:13:17.996 --> 01:13:20.830
God, I'm... I didn't
know that was her.

787
01:13:20.832 --> 01:13:23.366
How long were you at the bar?

788
01:13:23.368 --> 01:13:26.135
Uh, not very long.

789
01:13:26.137 --> 01:13:29.040
Quarter past twelve.
I took the tram home.

790
01:13:30.308 --> 01:13:32.844
Can anyone testify to that?

791
01:13:36.514 --> 01:13:42.086
Mr. Stevens, can
anyone testify to that?

792
01:13:44.022 --> 01:13:46.589
Yes.

793
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:49.859
Robert, my neighbor, he
was with me all night.

794
01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:51.661
Okay.

795
01:13:51.663 --> 01:13:54.830
So we'll have a
little chat with him.

796
01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:21.791
You knew my sister.

797
01:14:21.793 --> 01:14:23.259
I guess I did,
but it was brief.

798
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:24.694
I didn't even realize.

799
01:14:24.696 --> 01:14:27.098
Well, you knew her
well enough to call her.

800
01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:34.437
Why didn't you tell me?

801
01:14:34.439 --> 01:14:37.740
Because I didn't
realize until just now.

802
01:14:37.742 --> 01:14:40.409
And the car missing?

803
01:14:40.411 --> 01:14:42.878
That doesn't seem odd to you?

804
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.581
That was stolen from
work. You knew that.

805
01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:47.249
Well, it's a
fucking coincidence.

806
01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:49.919
What do you want me to say?

807
01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:53.756
I want you to
tell me the truth.

808
01:14:53.758 --> 01:14:56.961
Did you know my sister?

809
01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:02.631
I... I knew her.

810
01:15:02.633 --> 01:15:05.601
But I didn't realize I did.

811
01:15:05.603 --> 01:15:08.437
What does that change?

812
01:15:08.439 --> 01:15:10.975
Everything.

813
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.501
What did you tell them?

814
01:15:37.503 --> 01:15:39.837
The truth.

815
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.874
We took a tram at midnight.

816
01:15:44.876 --> 01:15:47.109
Took a tram at midnight.

817
01:15:47.111 --> 01:15:49.045
Okay?

818
01:15:49.047 --> 01:15:51.015
Come in.

819
01:15:54.485 --> 01:15:56.619
This has to stop.

820
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.155
What has to stop?

821
01:15:59.157 --> 01:16:01.557
You at the wheel.

822
01:16:07.899 --> 01:16:10.966
You think you're the only one
with something to lose here?

823
01:16:10.968 --> 01:16:13.669
They don't have
anything on us, right?

824
01:16:13.671 --> 01:16:16.205
They don't have a car.

825
01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:18.508
They don't have a witness.

826
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:20.209
No.

827
01:16:20.211 --> 01:16:24.715
Sleeping with the dead girl's
sister puts us at risk.

828
01:16:26.017 --> 01:16:29.519
You have to deal with it...

829
01:16:29.521 --> 01:16:31.187
now.

830
01:16:54.045 --> 01:16:57.081
What could you possibly
have to say to me?

831
01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.382
I...

832
01:17:00.384 --> 01:17:03.285
What, you're going
to make something up?

833
01:17:03.287 --> 01:17:05.589
I don't think so.

834
01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:15.064
<i>Ludza are the best fishing
grounds in the world.</i>

835
01:17:15.066 --> 01:17:17.366
<i>Throughout the year,
from March to October,</i>

836
01:17:17.368 --> 01:17:20.636
<i>fish can be found in
more than 50 lakes.</i>

837
01:17:31.883 --> 01:17:34.783
It's over. Are you satisfied?

838
01:17:34.785 --> 01:17:37.753
She'll turn on you.

839
01:17:37.755 --> 01:17:40.557
She'll ruin your life.

840
01:17:40.559 --> 01:17:42.758
You can't trust anyone, David.

841
01:18:18.696 --> 01:18:20.429
- Hi.
- Hi.

842
01:18:20.431 --> 01:18:23.032
- Vodka martini, please.
- Up, rocks?

843
01:18:23.034 --> 01:18:24.800
Rocks.

844
01:18:33.311 --> 01:18:35.647
Did you know her?

845
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:41.150
Janine?

846
01:18:41.152 --> 01:18:43.387
Sure.

847
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:47.325
She came here a lot.

848
01:18:50.194 --> 01:18:53.862
And the night she
died, did you see her?

849
01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:56.167
I saw her.

850
01:18:57.669 --> 01:19:00.302
She looked happy.

851
01:19:00.304 --> 01:19:03.374
So sad to hear the news.

852
01:19:04.676 --> 01:19:06.844
Thanks.

853
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.397
I'm sorry. I-I
don't speak Latvian.

854
01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:31.867
You need to catch the
shuttle bus heading north.

855
01:19:31.869 --> 01:19:35.006
Tram stop running in
the night. Construction.

856
01:19:38.543 --> 01:19:41.076
For how long?

857
01:19:41.078 --> 01:19:44.681
All night, from
Thursday until Monday.

858
01:19:44.683 --> 01:19:47.950
No trains after 10:00 p.m.

859
01:19:47.952 --> 01:19:50.019
Since when?

860
01:19:50.021 --> 01:19:53.759
Over a month now
it's been like this.

861
01:20:01.733 --> 01:20:05.036
You must be from out of town.

862
01:20:06.237 --> 01:20:08.404
Yes.

863
01:20:08.406 --> 01:20:10.607
Thank you.

864
01:20:41.238 --> 01:20:43.606
Vanessa?

865
01:20:43.608 --> 01:20:45.608
Hi.

866
01:20:45.610 --> 01:20:47.409
I need to speak with David.

867
01:20:47.411 --> 01:20:51.113
I'm sorry. He's not
here. He's got a deadline.

868
01:20:51.115 --> 01:20:54.850
Right. Another deadline.

869
01:20:54.852 --> 01:20:56.619
Can I help you?

870
01:20:56.621 --> 01:20:58.487
No, thank you.

871
01:20:58.489 --> 01:21:00.858
Okay.

872
01:21:03.695 --> 01:21:06.529
The night my sister was killed,

873
01:21:06.531 --> 01:21:10.432
you and David, you
left the bar together.

874
01:21:10.434 --> 01:21:12.602
Yes.

875
01:21:12.604 --> 01:21:14.269
By tram.

876
01:21:14.271 --> 01:21:16.673
We knew we were going to
drink, so we took the tram.

877
01:21:16.675 --> 01:21:18.340
And you left when?

878
01:21:18.342 --> 01:21:20.976
Why are you asking
me these questions?

879
01:21:20.978 --> 01:21:24.681
Answer me. What
time did you leave?

880
01:21:24.683 --> 01:21:26.949
Around midnight.

881
01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:29.885
The tram doesn't
run past 10:00.

882
01:21:29.887 --> 01:21:31.453
What?

883
01:21:31.455 --> 01:21:34.657
They've been out of
service for over a month.

884
01:21:36.795 --> 01:21:39.629
Vanessa...

885
01:21:39.631 --> 01:21:42.732
I know you're desperate to know
what happened to your sister.

886
01:21:42.734 --> 01:21:45.502
There's no need to lie.

887
01:21:45.504 --> 01:21:47.302
You lied to the police.

888
01:21:47.304 --> 01:21:49.806
You were in that
car, and you hit her.

889
01:21:49.808 --> 01:21:51.708
You left her there to die!

890
01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:53.008
Did I? Did I?!

891
01:22:59.243 --> 01:23:00.543
Robert.

892
01:23:00.545 --> 01:23:02.146
David!

893
01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.380
How the hell did
you get in here?

894
01:23:05.382 --> 01:23:07.249
- It was open.
- What are you talking about?

895
01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:10.219
It was locked.
I'm sorry, it was open.

896
01:23:10.221 --> 01:23:12.657
Who cares? Come on in.

897
01:23:15.092 --> 01:23:17.594
Sit down.

898
01:23:17.596 --> 01:23:19.762
You alright?

899
01:23:19.764 --> 01:23:21.600
Mm-hmm.

900
01:23:31.275 --> 01:23:33.776
So what are you doing here?

901
01:23:33.778 --> 01:23:35.945
Right.

902
01:23:35.947 --> 01:23:38.515
I know things haven't
been easy for us,

903
01:23:38.517 --> 01:23:40.984
with the accident
and everything,

904
01:23:40.986 --> 01:23:43.120
so I thought I'd
get you a present.

905
01:23:57.434 --> 01:24:01.136
That is two weeks
fly-fishing in Ludza.

906
01:24:01.138 --> 01:24:03.138
Train tickets.

907
01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.807
Leaves tomorrow night.

908
01:24:04.809 --> 01:24:06.475
What do you say?

909
01:24:08.312 --> 01:24:10.947
Robert, what are you doing?

910
01:24:10.949 --> 01:24:13.115
What?

911
01:24:13.117 --> 01:24:16.318
You know I can't
go. I have to work.

912
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.320
You could write an article.

913
01:24:18.322 --> 01:24:20.857
Shut up. Just
shut the fuck up.

914
01:24:20.859 --> 01:24:25.028
Whoa. I thought I was doing
something nice for a friend.

915
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:28.665
Friend. Oh,
we're not friends.

916
01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:32.037
We will never be friends.

917
01:24:34.039 --> 01:24:36.506
Get out of my house.

918
01:24:36.508 --> 01:24:37.707
David...

919
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:41.078
I'm asking you to leave.

920
01:24:43.848 --> 01:24:45.515
Fucking fishing trip.

921
01:24:45.517 --> 01:24:50.755
Get the fuck... out of my house!

922
01:25:46.578 --> 01:25:47.610
Hello?

923
01:25:47.612 --> 01:25:49.378
Vanessa, y-you
there? It's David.

924
01:25:52.449 --> 01:25:55.285
It's really important.

925
01:25:57.889 --> 01:26:00.123
It's about your sister.

926
01:26:33.825 --> 01:26:35.525
Phew!

927
01:27:45.196 --> 01:27:46.529
<i>Hi, it's Vanessa.</i>

928
01:27:46.531 --> 01:27:48.197
<i>You know the drill.</i>

929
01:27:51.703 --> 01:27:53.736
David, hi.

930
01:27:53.738 --> 01:27:55.204
Ooh!

931
01:27:55.206 --> 01:27:56.606
Sorry.

932
01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:59.242
Listen, our meeting
was canceled.

933
01:27:59.244 --> 01:28:01.010
- Why?
- Because no one can get

934
01:28:01.012 --> 01:28:02.044
a hold of Grant.

935
01:28:02.046 --> 01:28:03.411
Have you heard from him?

936
01:28:03.413 --> 01:28:05.848
- No.
- Well, he went on that trip,

937
01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:08.684
but still hasn't shown up yet,
so, we're going to postpone

938
01:28:08.686 --> 01:28:09.886
'til noon.
Okay.

939
01:28:09.888 --> 01:28:10.888
- Okay?
- Yeah.

940
01:28:42.987 --> 01:28:44.253
Hey, Grant, it's...

941
01:28:44.255 --> 01:28:45.121
It's David again.

942
01:28:45.123 --> 01:28:46.756
Just...

943
01:28:46.758 --> 01:28:48.925
give me a call when
you get a chance, okay?

944
01:28:48.927 --> 01:28:49.927
Just checking in.

945
01:29:25.462 --> 01:29:26.996
Excuse me. Excuse me, hi.

946
01:29:26.998 --> 01:29:28.998
Sorry to bother
you. Is it possible

947
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.465
I could borrow your
phone for a moment?

948
01:29:30.467 --> 01:29:31.767
Mine's run out of battery.

949
01:29:31.769 --> 01:29:32.602
Sure.

950
01:29:32.604 --> 01:29:33.936
You're so kind. Thank you.

951
01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:07.003
Vanessa.

952
01:30:07.005 --> 01:30:08.006
<i>Hello, David.</i>

953
01:30:09.874 --> 01:30:11.207
Robert?

954
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:12.541
Where's Vanessa?

955
01:30:12.543 --> 01:30:13.978
<i>She's with me.</i>

956
01:30:15.513 --> 01:30:17.546
Can you put her on
the phone, please?

957
01:30:17.548 --> 01:30:20.049
<i>No, not right now.</i>

958
01:30:20.051 --> 01:30:21.717
Robert, listen to me.
Whatever you're thinking

959
01:30:21.719 --> 01:30:25.056
about doing, we can
talk about this, okay?

960
01:30:25.857 --> 01:30:27.690
Just tell me where you are.

961
01:30:27.692 --> 01:30:30.326
<i>I'm thinking of
taking her fishing.</i>

962
01:30:30.328 --> 01:30:31.328
Ugh!

963
01:31:27.785 --> 01:31:28.918
Damn it!

964
01:32:15.133 --> 01:32:16.465
Oh, please.

965
01:32:18.202 --> 01:32:19.702
Please let me go.

966
01:32:19.704 --> 01:32:20.803
I won't tell anyone.

967
01:32:20.805 --> 01:32:22.338
Please, please,

968
01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.173
just let me go!

969
01:32:24.175 --> 01:32:25.207
Please!

970
01:32:25.209 --> 01:32:27.309
Shh.

971
01:32:39.657 --> 01:32:41.457
I'm going to tell
you a little story.

972
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:48.197
Your sister was alive

973
01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:49.398
when I drove away.

974
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:55.671
I convinced David
that she was dead

975
01:32:55.673 --> 01:32:57.173
and that he was the murderer.

976
01:32:59.477 --> 01:33:00.477
You see...

977
01:33:03.381 --> 01:33:04.541
I've never had a brother.

978
01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:27.370
Oh!

979
01:33:29.607 --> 01:33:30.607
Ah!
Ah!

980
01:33:51.195 --> 01:33:52.228
Oh, my God!

981
01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:53.230
Vanessa.

982
01:33:56.467 --> 01:33:57.633
Oh, my God.

983
01:34:01.939 --> 01:34:03.472
Vanessa.

984
01:34:03.474 --> 01:34:05.274
Oh, my God.

985
01:34:05.276 --> 01:34:07.443
Vanessa.

986
01:34:07.445 --> 01:34:09.145
I'm so...

987
01:34:10.582 --> 01:34:11.747
so sorry.

988
01:34:18.222 --> 01:34:19.222
David.

989
01:34:22.927 --> 01:34:24.293
What have you done?

990
01:34:24.295 --> 01:34:26.230
What have I done?

991
01:34:26.264 --> 01:34:27.429
What have I done?

992
01:34:27.431 --> 01:34:28.964
Are you thick?!

993
01:34:28.966 --> 01:34:30.399
I've protected <i>you.</i>

994
01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:32.401
That's what I've done.
Isn't it obvious?

995
01:34:32.403 --> 01:34:36.105
Like I've been protecting
you from the day I met you.

996
01:34:36.107 --> 01:34:37.339
You killed her!

997
01:34:37.341 --> 01:34:38.575
Oh, no, David.

998
01:34:40.745 --> 01:34:41.777
<i>You</i> killed her.

999
01:34:43.748 --> 01:34:45.314
You killed them both.

1000
01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:49.018
And your friend Grant.

1001
01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.688
Because you're too
stupid to listen.

1002
01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:54.591
You ungrateful prick.

1003
01:34:54.593 --> 01:34:58.294
I did this for <i>you!</i>

1004
01:35:00.532 --> 01:35:01.532
Oh!

1005
01:35:07.305 --> 01:35:09.171
No! David.

1006
01:35:09.173 --> 01:35:09.972
This isn't you!

1007
01:35:09.974 --> 01:35:11.807
You're a journalist.

1008
01:35:11.809 --> 01:35:12.975
I'm the murderer.

1009
01:35:12.977 --> 01:35:14.843
<i>You</i> are a good person.

1010
01:35:14.845 --> 01:35:16.378
Don't ruin <i>us.</i>
Aaaah!

1011
01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.379
Freeze!

1012
01:35:17.381 --> 01:35:18.280
Police.

1013
01:35:18.282 --> 01:35:19.815
Put the weapon down.

1014
01:35:19.817 --> 01:35:21.285
Hands behind your back.

1015
01:35:40.171 --> 01:35:40.970
Ah!

1016
01:35:40.972 --> 01:35:42.505
You cannot be serious!

1017
01:35:42.507 --> 01:35:43.906
He killed her!

1018
01:35:43.908 --> 01:35:46.077
Then we'll find some
fingerprints, won't we?

1019
01:35:58.256 --> 01:35:59.256
Let's move.

1020
01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:01.890
Come on, let's move.

1021
01:37:02.587 --> 01:37:03.753
What a beautiful day.

1022
01:38:22.834 --> 01:38:23.968
<i>Ja.</i>

1023
01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:31.008
Hmm?
