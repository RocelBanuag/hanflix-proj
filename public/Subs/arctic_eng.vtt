00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.343
Where's the ride?

2
00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:19.577
You said book the flights.

3
00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.813
You wanta mint?

4
00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.782
How're we gonna
make it to the dock?

5
00:01:23.548 --> 00:01:26.686
Alan, relax. There's
gotta be cabs here.

6
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.754
Look around, there's no cabs.

7
00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:29.955
There's none.

8
00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:30.856
Okay, alright.

9
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.991
Well, that's fine.

10
00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:32.825
We'll thumb it
and meet some locals.

11
00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:33.858
No, are you... Ray...

12
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.428
I don't wanna meet any locals,
alright?

13
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:37.939
What I wanna do is
I wanna make the boat

14
00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.733
which leaves in
15 frickin' minutes!

15
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.910
I'm gonna do something
right now, watch this.

16
00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.903
Watch this, Meurs.

17
00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.936
How ya doin'?

18
00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.277
The
number you have dialeds not in use.

19
00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:54.279
Hey, Alan!

20
00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:55.447
Alan, I got it worked out.

21
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.882
That's Alan.

22
00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.450
His buddy runs the cab company,

23
00:01:58.483 --> 00:01:59.695
he's gonna be here
in five minutes,

24
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.486
so uh, we're all set.

25
00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:04.589
You want a mint?

26
00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:41.419
Man 1: So where you guys from?

27
00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:43.488
Uh, United States, Los Angeles.

28
00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.824
It's your first
time on Svalbard?

29
00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:45.523
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.458
How do you like it?

31
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.527
I don't know yet.

32
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.562
Hm, Me neither.

33
00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.064
And I've been here for 26 years!

34
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.670
Locals are fun, Meurs.

35
00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.895
Don't forget,
we're the minority here.

36
00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:57.963
White people?

37
00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.899
No, bears!

38
00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:00.932
Good luck with that.

39
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.646
You the camera guy?

40
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.180
Yeah. Sean Tibbets.

41
00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.181
Sean, Ray Marsh.

42
00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.016
I host the show.

43
00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:17.683
Hi.

44
00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:18.483
Let me help you with that.

45
00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:20.219
No, no, no, no! I... I got that!

46
00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:21.887
I'll get this one.

47
00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:22.921
Thanks.

48
00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.934
Well, I'm sure producer said
this as he blew by,

49
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.060
but we're thrilled to have you.

50
00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.938
I don't know why our regular
guy didn't get a visa,

51
00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.697
but as long as you've got
a camera,

52
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.464
we'll get what we need.

53
00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.000
You ever done a travel show?

54
00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.001
Uh, no.

55
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.136
Nature show?

56
00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.671
No.

57
00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:40.105
You're gonna be great.

58
00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.612
Welcome on board the Langoysund!

59
00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:48.881
We are based in Longyearbyen,

60
00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:52.818
which is the northern most
settlement in the world.

61
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.088
We always have people from
all over the world on this boat,

62
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.690
so who is from Sweden?

63
00:05:57.723 --> 00:05:58.723
Hey!

64
00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:01.260
Hey, Swede brothers from Sweden!

65
00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:03.262
♪ Money, money, money ♪

66
00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:04.295
♪ They're always funny ♪

67
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.233
And we also have
some scientists from Tromso

68
00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.104
They are here to uh,
study aquaculture or Aquaman.

69
00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:14.038
Or something like this.

70
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.942
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't put your hands up.

71
00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:18.944
Uh, I think the books give
it away.

72
00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.514
And we also
have some Germans here.

73
00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:24.582
Germans!

74
00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.087
Always Germans visitor.

75
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.022
Wilkomen ja! All is gutta?

76
00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:30.823
Yeah!

77
00:06:30.856 --> 00:06:32.057
Supah dupah!

78
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.524
Yes!

79
00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:36.829
Last but not least,
we have Americans.

80
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.798
Some Hollywood weirdos.

81
00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.134
And they are here to
film beautiful Svalbard.

82
00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:45.237
And to corrupt us with their sex

83
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.872
and bad super hero movies.

84
00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:51.910
Okay! A few tips about Svalbard.

85
00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.179
These islands are one

86
00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.848
of 14 demilitarized zones,

87
00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.952
so there's no danger of war
here.

88
00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:03.222
You are in one of the
safest places in the world.

89
00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:06.692
Although, another way of looking
at it, of course,

90
00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.060
is that we're all sitting ducks

91
00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:09.928
if someone does decide
to wipe us out.

92
00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.765
That's a joke, come on!

93
00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.301
Come on, guys, come on!

94
00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.303
Okay, no more jokes!

95
00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.105
We have lunch a little bit later

96
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.174
and we have
some great viewing points,

97
00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.943
so if you have any problems,
any question,

98
00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.346
just shout out
and what's my name?

99
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.580
Jim! Jim!

100
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.184
Okay,
so let's get this baby rolling!

101
00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:52.938
Hey, brought you coffee.

102
00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.106
Thank you.

103
00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.878
Listen, I wanted to uh,
say sorry about before,

104
00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.389
I was stressed
about missing the boat...

105
00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:03.248
No, I understand.

106
00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.150
As you can see,
we have a shorthand.

107
00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.752
We grew up like brothers, so...

108
00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:10.489
But what about you?

109
00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:11.522
Whe... where you from?

110
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.126
Uh, nowhere in particular.

111
00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:15.360
I was an army brat.

112
00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.696
Really? Was that tough?

113
00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:18.831
Moving around?

114
00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.401
Yeah, but you get used to it.

115
00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:23.302
Yeah.

116
00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.337
I don't have friends
from 35 years ago.

117
00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:29.608
Hey, that might not be
such a bad thing, right?

118
00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.351
Did you get some...
some good stuff of Jim,

119
00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:40.284
up there on the deck?

120
00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:42.121
Yeah. He was great.

121
00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.822
He was, man?

122
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.767
Also went up to the bridge,
got some shots from up there.

123
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.859
Nice.

124
00:08:46.892 --> 00:08:48.193
Nice.

125
00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.096
Uh, did you get a shot from
the back of the boat?

126
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.764
Uh, no, I didn't.

127
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:54.399
I'll do that now.

128
00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.135
Yeah, could you?

129
00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.345
I think it would really
be useful.

130
00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.771
Yeah.

131
00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.306
Appreciate it, thank you, Sean.

132
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.408
Whoa, where you going?
You're my drinking buddy.

133
00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:10.182
He's a bit boring, huh?

134
00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.452
Well, we all are,
compared to you, Ray.

135
00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.921
Ugh, come on, Alan.
I said I was sorry.

136
00:09:15.954 --> 00:09:17.723
No, you didn't, actually.

137
00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.291
You didn't say you're sorry.

138
00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:22.794
Okay, okay. I apologize.

139
00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.196
I fucked up the travel.

140
00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:26.131
I was just tryin' to
make your life easy.

141
00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.699
And I appreciate you, bro.

142
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:28.834
It's fine.

143
00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:31.270
You got a great ass.

144
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.872
And it's a bit supple,

145
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.307
and it's a bit hairy,

146
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.974
but it's really nicely-shaped.

147
00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.076
It's supple. It's not hairy.

148
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.411
Yes, there he is. He's back!

149
00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:40.546
I like it! I like it!

150
00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:41.113
Such an asshole.

151
00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:42.481
Appreciate it.

152
00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:43.882
I like to see you in that shape.

153
00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.817
Now let's welcome
Sean to the party, huh?

154
00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.119
Hey, hey, Ray, listen,

155
00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:48.363
we are lucky to have this guy,
okay?

156
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.454
Please don't piss him off.

157
00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.322
He's gonna be fine.

158
00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.224
He's gonna be fine!
He's a big boy.

159
00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:56.028
What's his story anyways?

160
00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:57.196
Why the hell's he in Norway?

161
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.397
Who knows?

162
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.999
I'm just thankful that we got
a guy with 2 days' notice.

163
00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.768
Yeah. Yeah, that was lucky.

164
00:10:03.902 --> 00:10:05.013
What the hell's
he got for lunch?

165
00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.039
Ray. Hey, that's his food.

166
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.943
Whoa! What the...

167
00:10:12.377 --> 00:10:14.446
Jesus, that is some retro rig!

168
00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:15.479
Wow.

169
00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.850
Don't turn it on! Come on.

170
00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.752
Ray.

171
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:21.753
IT'S WEIRD.

172
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.222
Ray. Shit.

173
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.489
WHALE MUSIC.

174
00:10:26.024 --> 00:10:27.024
Ray.

175
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.499
Uh, it's actually pretty
relaxing.

176
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.300
Nice.

177
00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:38.904
You check it out.

178
00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.078
Oh shit.

179
00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.315
Turn it off, turn it off! hit!

180
00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:54.319
Hey, man.

181
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:54.987
Excuse me.

182
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.020
Yeah, bro. Yeah.

183
00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:57.922
Don't forget your coffee.

184
00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:02.561
Thanks.

185
00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:03.594
Yeah.

186
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.531
What? He'll be fine.

187
00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:12.170
Don't look now, but I think
the German girls are into us.

188
00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:14.573
Don't say anything.

189
00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:15.207
Alright.

190
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.508
No, Ray, don't.

191
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.210
Oh, here we go...

192
00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:19.911
Hello, ladies!

193
00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.014
- Hi - Oh, hello again.

194
00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:24.082
Listen, did you meet
my old friend Alan Meursault?

195
00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.384
- Oh, no, not yet.
- Not yet.

196
00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.019
Hi, how are you?

197
00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:28.954
Uh, I apologize for Ray here.

198
00:11:28.987 --> 00:11:31.123
He's very forward,
so feel free to ignore him.

199
00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.325
No, no, it's alright!

200
00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:33.925
Yes, yes.

201
00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:34.993
We know he talks a lot.

202
00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:35.894
Yes.

203
00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:36.895
We have his show in Germany.

204
00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:37.730
Oh!

205
00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.131
Oh, they have my show
in Germany!

206
00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:41.566
Oh, you see what he said?

207
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.135
He said his show.

208
00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:44.236
Yes.

209
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.903
Why? Do you work on the show,
too?

210
00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:46.371
Uh, yes, I do.

211
00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.306
What it is that you...
'cause I don't remember you.

212
00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.473
Yeah.

213
00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.547
Uh, no, I'm not on camera.

214
00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:51.343
Alan's being very modest.

215
00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:53.211
He... he actually IS the show,

216
00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.322
he's the director and producer.

217
00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.048
Oh wow!

218
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.082
I'm just the mouthpiece.

219
00:11:58.116 --> 00:11:58.350
- So it's your show.
- Yeah, so it's your show.

220
00:11:58.383 --> 00:11:59.383
Yes.

221
00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.139
Jesus.

222
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.082
Dammit.

223
00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.187
If there is a place on Earth

224
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.523
that could bring about
an existential crisis,

225
00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.392
Svalbard must be it.

226
00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.427
Looking at this barren
landscape,

227
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.363
it's hard to believe life
can be sustained here at all.

228
00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.400
But there are multitudes of
species on land, in the air,

229
00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.635
and underwater.

230
00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:25.370
We even found a
Viking Santa Claus!

231
00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:29.074
Ho, ho, ho!

232
00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:30.375
Okay and cut.

233
00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:31.143
Perfect.

234
00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:32.043
Is that it?

235
00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:32.411
Yeah,
we'll use that for the opening.

236
00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:32.944
That's it!

237
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:33.578
Oh wow, that's easy!

238
00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:35.280
Hey man, you're a natural.

239
00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:35.914
You were great.

240
00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:37.549
Thank you, Jim. Thank you.

241
00:13:37.582 --> 00:13:39.050
Jim, I gotta ask you this,

242
00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.018
and I... and don't want it

243
00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:42.220
to come out the wrong way,

244
00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.089
but why do people live
in this place?

245
00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.526
To get away from
people like you.

246
00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:51.596
Nah, but you know, it's...

247
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:54.065
I think it's for the beauty
really.

248
00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.033
Hmm.

249
00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.269
And the solitude, and the risk.

250
00:13:57.302 --> 00:13:58.570
Hmm.

251
00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.740
'Cause up here,
it's nature that sets the rules,

252
00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:03.475
and if you don't
play by those rules,

253
00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:06.444
you're dead.

254
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.616
Maybe they find you
when the spring comes.

255
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.550
Maybe not.

256
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.989
You're kind of a wacko,
aren't you, Jim?

257
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:23.295
Come on, guys,
would you like a drink?

258
00:14:23.328 --> 00:14:24.329
Sure!

259
00:14:24.362 --> 00:14:26.298
Well, you have drink. You guys.

260
00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:27.432
I... I don't drink anymore.

261
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.202
Oh my God, that's terrible.

262
00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:32.672
Uh, let's go.

263
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.583
Uh, I have some cognac
and ice from the glaciers!

264
00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:35.507
How does it look?

265
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.575
Oh, looks good.

266
00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.643
Yah, good.

267
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:45.183
Jesus, did you see that?

268
00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:46.051
What?

269
00:14:46.084 --> 00:14:47.787
Th... there was a bird.

270
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.354
No.

271
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:52.557
I... I don't think it had eyes.

272
00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:54.627
What do you mean?

273
00:14:56.394 --> 00:14:57.362
I don't know.

274
00:14:57.395 --> 00:14:58.497
I must be seeing things.

275
00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:08.106
Hi. Uh, two cognac.

276
00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:12.310
Excuse me.

277
00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.755
You guys are from
the university, right?

278
00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.247
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

279
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.280
- Yeah.
- Yes.

280
00:15:17.048 --> 00:15:18.292
Uh, can I ask you
what you're studying?

281
00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:19.251
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

282
00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:20.452
- Um.
- Um.

283
00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:22.688
Well, yeah, the university
in uh, Tromso,

284
00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:24.189
they wanna open
a fish hatchery here.

285
00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:28.126
Um, so we're studying
the water, and food sources,

286
00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:28.661
and things like this.

287
00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:29.361
Oh, I see...

288
00:15:29.394 --> 00:15:31.196
But we're much more interested

289
00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:33.398
in the geomagnetic storms
up here.

290
00:15:33.431 --> 00:15:34.232
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

291
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.602
I don't know what...
what is that?

292
00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:38.169
Uh, when there's a storm
on the sun,

293
00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:41.406
that affects the Earth's
magnetic field.

294
00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:42.719
Have you ever
heard of an aurora?

295
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.309
- The northern lights, yes.
- Yes!

296
00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:45.410
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:15:45.443 --> 00:15:46.779
And that's a type of geostorm.

298
00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.781
Are they dangerous?

299
00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.515
Not so far, but...

300
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.350
- They could be.
- Yeah

301
00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.386
Um, a... a massive one
and all technology on Earth

302
00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.855
would be useless.

303
00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.522
Uh, the planet will go dark.

304
00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.325
Everything with electricity
would be totally corrupted.

305
00:16:00.358 --> 00:16:00.860
Really?

306
00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.427
Yeah.

307
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.605
Well, what about the human
brain? That's electric?

308
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.597
Ah, the thinkers have
found each other!

309
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.232
- Yes.
- Haven't they? Yes.

310
00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:08.868
Well, let me jump right
into it, kids,

311
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.703
because I know you're
into science world,

312
00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.684
is there room
for God in science?

313
00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:24.883
That's pretty deep.

314
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:26.351
Should...
Should we have a cigarette?

315
00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:27.586
Yes! Good idea.

316
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.553
Okay, bye, will see you.

317
00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:29.254
See ya.

318
00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:30.388
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:34.859
You alright?

320
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560
Yeah, fine.

321
00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.197
You're thinking about Marie.

322
00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.434
She's not gonna leave you.

323
00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:44.770
It's just a warning,
she wants things to change.

324
00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:46.772
How are things gonna change?

325
00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.474
She doesn't want me to travel
for work, that's what I do.

326
00:16:49.507 --> 00:16:51.147
What the fuck
are we even doing here, man?

327
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:53.613
This isn't fun anymore.

328
00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:54.680
It's... it's not fun.

329
00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:56.557
What are you... what are you
talkin' about, Alan?

330
00:16:56.581 --> 00:16:58.216
People literally
do this for fun.

331
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:59.584
They travel the world for fun.

332
00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:01.586
Yeah,
but is it worth my marriage?

333
00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:02.788
Is it worth my kids?

334
00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:05.557
We're back in 10 days.

335
00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:10.261
I'm 4,500 miles away from home.

336
00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:13.733
I've literally run
away from my problems.

337
00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:14.432
Who does that?

338
00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:15.200
Everybody.

339
00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:16.501
Everybody does that.

340
00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:17.167
Everybody.

341
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.203
I do that.

342
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.310
You know, it's this place,
it's just makin' you squirrelly.

343
00:17:26.344 --> 00:17:27.680
Yeah, I know.

344
00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:28.914
We're back in 10 days.

345
00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.256
It's goring the baby!

346
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:39.289
It's the mother!

347
00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:51.904
I've never seen anything
like that before.

348
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.809
Can we go inside, please?

349
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.645
The show is over, please.

350
00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:03.749
Come on!

351
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.518
Okay, please inside.

352
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:09.822
Huh.

353
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.824
And you as well.

354
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.436
What the hell was that?

355
00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:26.605
I don't know. It's gruesome

356
00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:27.639
Yeah.

357
00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:30.710
We... we got that, right?

358
00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:31.743
- Yeah.
- Good.

359
00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.613
God, that was strange!

360
00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:36.849
This is a strange
place, my friend.

361
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.951
Ladies and gentlemen,

362
00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.820
we are now taking lunch
on the bow

363
00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.788
where we have some
tasty minke whale for you.

364
00:18:43.823 --> 00:18:44.890
Exhibit A.

365
00:18:48.426 --> 00:18:49.506
Jim, whenever you're ready.

366
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.998
Well, whaling is
legal in Norway.

367
00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:54.867
This is minke whale.

368
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.971
The law allows 999 minke
to be caught every year.

369
00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:02.675
It used to be that
every Norwegian ate Minke,

370
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.310
but now it's mostly
the people in the north.

371
00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:08.446
The snobs in Oslo,
they don't go for Minke.

372
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.850
No! They feel sorry for it.

373
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.856
Mmm. It tastes a bit like human.

374
00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.626
And cut.

375
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.303
- I think... I think we got that!
- Oh, that's very good.

376
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.063
Thank you very much, everybody!

377
00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:26.498
Uh, hey Sean, shoot...
shoot some B roll.

378
00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:28.143
Yeah, I think I'll have
your job in a minute.

379
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.001
- I give it freely.

380
00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:29.567
Yeah!

381
00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.069
- That was a great job.

382
00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:30.568
It's good?

383
00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:31.203
Thank you so much.

384
00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:32.738
Um, do you want some more?

385
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:33.371
- No.
- No!

386
00:19:33.404 --> 00:19:34.073
You sure?

387
00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:34.539
No, we're okay, yeah, thank you.

388
00:19:34.572 --> 00:19:35.440
It's delicious.

389
00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:37.113
I'll... I'll get
some plates for you guys.

390
00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:39.612
That minke is killin' me, man.

391
00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.446
You ate it?

392
00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:43.381
You didn't?

393
00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:45.751
There's a fine line
between polite and stupid, Alan.

394
00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:46.928
You know what?
I need a bathroom.

395
00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.152
My stomach's about to explode.

396
00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:08.073
Oh God!

397
00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.107
How was that?

398
00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.943
Whale of a time?

399
00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.377
Very funny.

400
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.245
Where's Sean?

401
00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.947
He's getting some
stuff on the front.

402
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.980
Good.

403
00:20:56.487 --> 00:20:57.823
Jesus Christ.

404
00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:24.983
Where is everyone?

405
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:26.918
Did we miss something?

406
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:30.956
Was there an excursion?

407
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.510
They wouldn't have
left all their shit.

408
00:21:36.527 --> 00:21:37.595
Hello?

409
00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:41.867
Jim?

410
00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:43.002
They must be in the lounge.

411
00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:56.214
Captain?

412
00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:47.809
I don't know what the
hell is goin' on here.

413
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.269
Alright, wait,
let's talk this out.

414
00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:51.670
Uh, we're on the bow.

415
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:52.537
We're shooting that
whale stuff with Jim.

416
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.038
- Yeah.
- Right?

417
00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:54.539
Everybody's there.

418
00:22:54.572 --> 00:22:55.684
You get sick,
you go to the bathroom.

419
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:56.942
Right.

420
00:22:56.976 --> 00:22:58.253
I come out,
we're talkin' on the back deck,

421
00:22:58.277 --> 00:22:59.678
power goes out.

422
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:02.982
It was maybe five minutes
at most.

423
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.851
What?

424
00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:07.686
Hello?

425
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.787
Sean! Jesus.

426
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:09.421
Yeah!

427
00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:10.588
Where is everyone?

428
00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.726
I don't know.
I was in the bathroom.

429
00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:15.039
Well, what the fuck is goin' on?

430
00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:16.829
What do you mean?
They're not outside?

431
00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:17.763
No!

432
00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.932
No. No one's outside.

433
00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:21.776
No one's inside.
No one's on this fucking boat.

434
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.202
Okay, is this real?

435
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:24.803
Am I going insane?

436
00:23:24.837 --> 00:23:25.771
You guys are
fucking with me, right?

437
00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:27.639
No,
I'm not fucking with you, man.

438
00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:28.907
This is not...

439
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:30.118
Th... this defies the laws
of nature.

440
00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:31.744
There's no logical explanation
for it.

441
00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:34.146
Did you check the bridge?

442
00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.781
Yeah nothing.

443
00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:37.216
What about the engine room?

444
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.150
You think everyone stuffed
themselves in the engine room?

445
00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:39.785
There's fucking 20 people
on this boat.

446
00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.059
I'm gonna check the engine room.

447
00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:51.130
Have you seen my notebook?

448
00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:51.930
Your notebook?

449
00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:53.932
Alan, plug in for Christ's sake.

450
00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:55.034
We're looking for people.

451
00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:07.879
Hello?

452
00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:18.157
Hello?

453
00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:39.043
This is Tibbets.

454
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.749
Hello? Hello?

455
00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.260
I'm eating a donut.

456
00:24:56.395 --> 00:24:57.930
Oh, we're gonna be in trouble.

457
00:24:57.963 --> 00:24:59.098
Um.

458
00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:01.934
Yes, daddy, I am eating a donut.

459
00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.239
Hello?

460
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:17.875
Hello!

461
00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:24.082
Uh, this is uh, M.S. Langoysund.

462
00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:26.051
The... we have a Mayday.

463
00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:28.954
People have disappeared.

464
00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:31.456
We... we... need help!

465
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.490
We have an emergency.

466
00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:43.368
Uh, yes this is Langoysund.
Mayday.

467
00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:45.771
We, uh... we left Longyearbyen
maybe

468
00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.406
uh, four hours ago.

469
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.408
We... we've been going north.

470
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.014
Uh, northwest, ah, four hours.
The fuck!

471
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.352
Uh, Mayday, we have... we're,
Listen, we're drifting!

472
00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.087
We have no power!

473
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.223
And uh...

474
00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:06.358
No... no power.

475
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:46.932
What're you doing, Alan?

476
00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:50.968
Alan!

477
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.338
Does it matter?

478
00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:55.941
Yeah, it fuckin' matters!

479
00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.143
We're drifting.

480
00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.256
I saw something, come here.

481
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.591
That's a town.

482
00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:13.992
Maybe it's where they all went.

483
00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:19.097
I'll get the raft.

484
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.980
Alan.

485
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.982
Meursey, we saw a town,
we're gonna go to shore.

486
00:29:48.053 --> 00:29:50.055
Whoa, you know you're
bleeding, right?

487
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.591
Did you fall?

488
00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:53.659
No.

489
00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:56.473
This needs cleaning. Come
inside.

490
00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:26.391
Oh!

491
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.197
You think Jim is a big
Hunter S. Thompson fan?

492
00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:37.603
I love this book.

493
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.611
You know, I'm gonna keep this
for him.

494
00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.425
Where'd you get the rifle?

495
00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:04.095
Get in, we should go.

496
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.132
We should stick together.

497
00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:15.467
There's bears everywhere.

498
00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:20.372
You know how to use that?

499
00:32:22.207 --> 00:32:24.175
Point and shoot, right?

500
00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:35.287
This place isn't right.

501
00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:51.837
It's gotta be an old coal mine.

502
00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:54.958
It's a goddamn
wasteland is what it is.

503
00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:06.719
If there's no one
here, we're fucked, Ray.

504
00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:54.599
Hello?

505
00:34:33.973 --> 00:34:35.507
Maybe we should
go back to the boat?

506
00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:38.744
Do you think the Amish
built this place?

507
00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:39.543
Alan, focus.
Isten, we need a plan.

508
00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:40.980
Look at the wood work.

509
00:34:41.013 --> 00:34:41.847
Sean, should we
go back to the boat?

510
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.848
Amish swimming pool?

511
00:34:42.882 --> 00:34:45.550
Or is that like against
their religion or...

512
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.828
I mean we at least
had food there.

513
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.518
Hay, look at the detail work.

514
00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.520
Guys, guys.

515
00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:48.954
- Honestly, this is not...-look at
the... look...

516
00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:50.388
Quiet. Quiet!

517
00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:53.257
What is this?

518
00:34:58.931 --> 00:34:59.931
Hey.

519
00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:41.005
What the fuck is that?

520
00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.367
Jesus.

521
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:26.786
There's no one here.

522
00:36:26.819 --> 00:36:28.419
There's NO ONE HERE!

523
00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:29.889
What in God's name is going on?

524
00:36:29.922 --> 00:36:30.922
God?

525
00:36:31.791 --> 00:36:32.791
You know what, God?

526
00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.326
Show yourself to me, huh?

527
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.920
Show yourself to me,
you fucking coward!

528
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.900
Alan, we need you here now if
we're gonna get through this.

529
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:43.702
Yeah? Get through this?

530
00:36:43.736 --> 00:36:47.372
Ray, this is not some
travel incident, okay?

531
00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:50.643
The airline didn't just
lose our fucking luggage.

532
00:36:50.676 --> 00:36:54.412
A supernatural event
occurred here, Ray!

533
00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:55.446
That's what's happening!

534
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.816
Who gives a shit?

535
00:36:56.849 --> 00:36:58.516
We need your help!

536
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.085
You know something?

537
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:02.429
This - this is proof that there
is something bigger than us.

538
00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:03.453
Am I right Sean?

539
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:05.791
Yeah, see, he gets it, Ray.

540
00:37:05.825 --> 00:37:09.795
Alright, this-this is beyond
our meager existence!

541
00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:11.964
Why is there no one here?

542
00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:13.531
You know why?

543
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.768
Because we... we're in
the middle of the hereafter Ray!

544
00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:16.936
For fuck's sake!

545
00:37:16.969 --> 00:37:18.671
This makes no sense.
It makes no sense.

546
00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.471
This is a ghost town.

547
00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.507
It's a ghost town
and we're the fuckin' ghosts!

548
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.042
- No, -No.
- Alan: Yeah!

549
00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:24.076
No. No, no.

550
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:25.611
The people went somewhere.

551
00:37:25.644 --> 00:37:26.924
We just have to
figure out where.

552
00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:30.015
Is that what you're worried
about?

553
00:37:30.049 --> 00:37:30.716
Is that what you're
worried about?

554
00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:32.350
W... where all the people went?

555
00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:36.021
I don't give a shit
where anybody went.

556
00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:37.135
You know what I care about?

557
00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:41.459
I care about
why we're still here.

558
00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:45.563
Think about it, Ray.

559
00:38:12.825 --> 00:38:14.459
Hello!

560
00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:17.930
Hello!

561
00:38:18.864 --> 00:38:19.864
Ghosts, Ray.

562
00:38:27.673 --> 00:38:29.174
Whoa, whoa.

563
00:38:29.208 --> 00:38:29.675
What?

564
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.110
There's something.

565
00:38:34.647 --> 00:38:35.647
Ray.

566
00:38:36.649 --> 00:38:37.649
Oh.

567
00:38:49.795 --> 00:38:50.963
Sounds like a radio...

568
00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:09.547
I don't buy it,
there's gotta be someone here.

569
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.216
Someone was here!

570
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.885
Who the fuck was there??

571
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.189
Goddamit!

572
00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:18.057
Fuck!

573
00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:19.191
Fuck!

574
00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:23.896
Ow!

575
00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.700
Fuck!

576
00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.743
That does not look good.

577
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.485
I think I'm gonna just park it
here for a second.

578
00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:49.487
You know?

579
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.957
We gotta keep lookin' around
Meursey, we'll come back for you

580
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:53.058
okay?

581
00:39:53.092 --> 00:39:54.525
Okay.

582
00:39:55.995 --> 00:39:56.995
You got that?

583
00:39:57.863 --> 00:39:59.131
Yeah, I'm good.

584
00:40:06.605 --> 00:40:09.641
Hey, bring back another TV.

585
00:40:09.675 --> 00:40:10.943
This one's busted.

586
00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:24.289
We gotta talk about Alan, man.

587
00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:25.323
Yeah.

588
00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:02.628
"Well, I thought"

589
00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:05.697
this is how the world works.

590
00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:10.369
All energy flows

591
00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:11.904
according to the whims

592
00:41:13.872 --> 00:41:15.874
of the Great Magnet.

593
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.146
"What a fool I was to defy him."

594
00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:32.324
"There I's a
big machinen the sky,"

595
00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:36.061
some kind of electric snake,

596
00:41:36.095 --> 00:41:38.063
coming right at us.

597
00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:43.268
We'd be fools not to ride
this strange torpedo

598
00:41:43.302 --> 00:41:45.003
all the way out to the end.

599
00:41:47.773 --> 00:41:50.776
The possibility for physical

600
00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:54.113
and mental collapse is now
very real.

601
00:41:55.447 --> 00:41:57.182
No sympathy for the Devil.

602
00:41:58.183 --> 00:41:59.318
Buy the ticket,

603
00:42:00.786 --> 00:42:01.987
"take the ride."

604
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:06.238
Are you my friend?

605
00:45:09.274 --> 00:45:10.309
I'm your friend.

606
00:45:12.477 --> 00:45:16.014
And friends don't eat friends.

607
00:46:04.029 --> 00:46:05.197
You got a family?

608
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:08.300
Got an aunt and uncle
in the States.

609
00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:10.670
That's about it.

610
00:46:10.703 --> 00:46:12.170
How'd you end up here?

611
00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:15.874
Came to Oslo for a girl.

612
00:46:17.677 --> 00:46:18.910
How'd it work out?

613
00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:20.978
Like all the rest.

614
00:46:23.382 --> 00:46:25.317
Sounds like a
Norwegian country song.

615
00:46:35.728 --> 00:46:36.995
Well,

616
00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:38.497
tryin' is succeeding in my book.

617
00:46:40.098 --> 00:46:42.501
Yeah, then I'm a massive
success.

618
00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:48.005
You?

619
00:46:49.207 --> 00:46:52.010
I'm a total failure
by that metric.

620
00:46:52.043 --> 00:46:53.044
Commitment issues.

621
00:46:54.413 --> 00:46:55.615
So you're a coward?

622
00:46:59.117 --> 00:47:00.952
Yeah. I guess.

623
00:47:02.988 --> 00:47:04.788
Scared of a makin' a
choice I can't live with.

624
00:47:07.459 --> 00:47:09.294
All seems ridiculous right now.

625
00:47:12.765 --> 00:47:14.499
What's the story
with that necklace?

626
00:47:16.435 --> 00:47:18.136
It's my sister, Cassie.

627
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:20.539
We used to play Jacks.

628
00:47:21.573 --> 00:47:23.108
She died when I was 10.

629
00:47:24.576 --> 00:47:25.576
Sorry.

630
00:47:26.411 --> 00:47:27.411
Uh, it's alright.

631
00:47:29.047 --> 00:47:30.949
I try to live for the both of us
now.

632
00:47:32.752 --> 00:47:34.730
I like doin' the show, '-cause
it keeps me movin' you know,

633
00:47:34.754 --> 00:47:36.121
makes me feel alive.

634
00:47:38.557 --> 00:47:41.493
Meurs doesn't like bein'
away so much anymore.

635
00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:45.095
There's a light on.

636
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.640
Hello?

637
00:47:58.577 --> 00:47:59.679
Holy shit.

638
00:48:01.346 --> 00:48:02.346
It's heated.

639
00:48:04.684 --> 00:48:05.984
I'm gonna check upstairs.

640
00:48:23.703 --> 00:48:24.703
Hello?

641
00:48:25.805 --> 00:48:27.239
Is someone here?

642
00:50:31.563 --> 00:50:32.563
Meursey!

643
00:50:38.971 --> 00:50:41.607
What the hell are
you doin' out here?

644
00:50:43.743 --> 00:50:45.477
Oh hey, you got my message.

645
00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:48.714
Let's go.

646
00:50:48.748 --> 00:50:50.315
Let's get you inside. Come on.

647
00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:52.517
When did it start snowing?

648
00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:55.520
Come on, buddy.

649
00:51:09.969 --> 00:51:11.771
There's food in the kitchen.

650
00:51:11.804 --> 00:51:13.204
That's great.

651
00:51:13.238 --> 00:51:15.340
I'm gonna go outside
and grab the bags.

652
00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:27.787
I saw a bear.

653
00:51:28.954 --> 00:51:30.255
What's that?

654
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:35.592
Hey, Ray?

655
00:51:37.562 --> 00:51:38.798
Yeah?

656
00:51:44.036 --> 00:51:45.270
I need a drink.

657
00:51:50.575 --> 00:51:51.977
What can I get you?

658
00:51:54.613 --> 00:51:55.948
Anything.

659
00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:57.582
Whiskey.

660
00:51:57.616 --> 00:51:59.317
Anything.

661
00:52:22.474 --> 00:52:23.776
Goddammit!

662
00:53:04.449 --> 00:53:05.449
Hey, Ray.

663
00:53:06.018 --> 00:53:07.452
Yeah?

664
00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:13.591
I'm not mad about
the taxi anymore.

665
00:54:10.415 --> 00:54:11.415
Ray?

666
00:54:12.885 --> 00:54:14.485
I need a bathroom.

667
00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:45.084
There you are.

668
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.192
Alright come on. eah, come on.

669
00:54:53.225 --> 00:54:54.225
Alright.

670
00:54:55.928 --> 00:54:58.163
Oh, okay. Okay!

671
00:54:58.898 --> 00:55:02.467
There you go. There you go.

672
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.500
I'll get you some soup.

673
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.112
And Elsie is really looking
forward to this.

674
00:55:47.146 --> 00:55:49.982
No. Elsie is not looking
forward to this!

675
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:40.632
Ray.

676
00:56:45.838 --> 00:56:47.806
Here's some soup
and water, Meurs.

677
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:55.080
Alan, you gotta stop drinkin'.
It's messing you up, man.

678
00:56:55.114 --> 00:56:58.650
- No, I saw... I saw Sean...
- Just lay back.

679
00:56:58.684 --> 00:56:59.894
- Just relax
- On... on the video.

680
00:56:59.918 --> 00:57:01.586
Just lay back.

681
00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.654
Hey.

682
00:57:03.989 --> 00:57:05.891
I left the luggage in the lobby.

683
00:57:05.924 --> 00:57:06.924
Thanks.

684
00:57:07.259 --> 00:57:08.627
Listen, there's food here,

685
00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.862
but not much else.

686
00:57:09.895 --> 00:57:11.562
Okay.

687
00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:13.756
So we're gonna need to find
a working radio or move on.

688
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.968
Move on? Where?

689
00:57:16.668 --> 00:57:17.668
Longyearbyen.

690
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.140
We have the nautical charts,
it's only 40 miles away.

691
00:57:21.173 --> 00:57:22.173
How long would that take?

692
00:57:23.308 --> 00:57:25.978
In that boat,
four and a half hours,

693
00:57:26.011 --> 00:57:28.180
assuming the conditions are good
and there's no wind.

694
00:57:29.715 --> 00:57:30.715
Okay.

695
00:57:31.884 --> 00:57:33.285
We need more fuel.

696
00:57:33.318 --> 00:57:34.853
There's probably some here.

697
00:57:34.887 --> 00:57:36.922
There's no instruments
on that raft.

698
00:57:36.955 --> 00:57:38.589
We have to respect the elements.

699
00:57:38.624 --> 00:57:39.664
We'd be killing ourselves.

700
00:57:40.826 --> 00:57:41.727
He's in and out, man.

701
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.095
He needs medical attention.

702
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.902
Look, civil twilight's
in three hours, then darkness.

703
00:57:49.935 --> 00:57:51.112
It's too dangerous to be
on the water

704
00:57:51.136 --> 00:57:53.272
for at least six hours.

705
00:57:55.074 --> 00:57:56.675
I'll find some fuel.

706
00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:04.215
Ray!

707
00:58:08.987 --> 00:58:10.222
For the bears.

708
00:58:11.423 --> 00:58:12.991
Thanks.

709
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:24.603
What are you doing here?

710
00:58:25.838 --> 00:58:27.372
Who... ho...

711
00:58:29.208 --> 00:58:30.375
Who are you?

712
00:59:11.817 --> 00:59:13.852
What are you doing?

713
00:59:13.886 --> 00:59:15.687
What are you doing?

714
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:17.990
No. No.

715
00:59:18.023 --> 00:59:19.992
Who are you? No.

716
00:59:20.025 --> 00:59:20.492
Shh.

717
00:59:20.526 --> 00:59:22.294
No. No.

718
00:59:33.405 --> 00:59:35.340
No. No.

719
01:01:01.326 --> 01:01:03.028
How the hell did we end up here?

720
01:01:14.406 --> 01:01:16.475
Jesus.

721
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:24.249
Ray.

722
01:01:24.283 --> 01:01:26.151
Ray, Ray, Ray.

723
01:01:28.487 --> 01:01:29.888
You gotta stop drinking.

724
01:01:29.921 --> 01:01:31.957
You gotta try
and get some water down there.

725
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:33.292
He was... he was upstairs.

726
01:01:34.993 --> 01:01:36.428
Was watchin' it all go down

727
01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:37.996
like a Jesus

728
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:39.831
I saw him, Ray.

729
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.436
Okay brother, just relax.
Ake it easy.

730
01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:46.571
The boat. The boat.

731
01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:49.308
I saw a video of Sean

732
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:51.343
and now he's tryin'...

733
01:01:51.376 --> 01:01:53.056
He's tryin' to kill me
with the headphones.

734
01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:56.214
Alan, you're not makin' sense.
Just relax!

735
01:01:56.982 --> 01:01:58.884
It's a fucking plot!

736
01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:00.218
Alan, relax!

737
01:02:00.252 --> 01:02:03.021
Listen, he's killing
my fucking mind, Ray!

738
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:06.158
I'm fucking dying.

739
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.262
Watch the video, Ray.

740
01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:13.498
Watch the video.

741
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.650
You son of a bitch!

742
01:03:07.552 --> 01:03:09.354
What the hell are you doing?

743
01:03:09.388 --> 01:03:10.388
What are you up to?

744
01:03:11.624 --> 01:03:13.358
You said you were
in the bathroom!

745
01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:14.392
What are you hiding?

746
01:03:20.365 --> 01:03:21.566
Fuck!

747
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.637
I'm gonna punch your
fuckin' lights out!

748
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:25.337
Alright, alright, alright,
alright,

749
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:27.139
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

750
01:03:39.284 --> 01:03:40.524
Just what the fuck is goin' on?

751
01:03:41.654 --> 01:03:43.522
I'm just here
to document the effects.

752
01:03:44.222 --> 01:03:46.291
Effects? Of what?

753
01:03:46.324 --> 01:03:47.426
Experiment.

754
01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:50.128
What experiment?

755
01:03:51.697 --> 01:03:53.666
We were all exposed
to a vibration.

756
01:03:55.267 --> 01:03:58.336
It's like a hum, but
you can't hear it.

757
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.038
Exposed?

758
01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:02.274
What does that mean?

759
01:04:02.307 --> 01:04:03.575
It's a sonic weapon.

760
01:04:04.644 --> 01:04:07.045
It attacks neural function.

761
01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:09.181
The brain.

762
01:04:12.184 --> 01:04:14.486
You're in the military?

763
01:04:17.322 --> 01:04:18.356
Not anymore.

764
01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:22.561
What are you?
Ome kinda mercenary?

765
01:04:22.594 --> 01:04:24.196
No,
they just paid me to be here.

766
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:26.531
Film it.

767
01:04:26.565 --> 01:04:28.033
Who?

768
01:04:28.066 --> 01:04:29.501
Who's doing this?
Some government?

769
01:04:33.038 --> 01:04:35.073
People you don't wanna know,
trust me.

770
01:04:35.942 --> 01:04:37.285
They could be working
for some government,

771
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:38.749
but I don't know anything
about that.

772
01:04:40.445 --> 01:04:42.347
They just hired me to film it.

773
01:04:44.182 --> 01:04:45.317
What did you see?

774
01:04:46.819 --> 01:04:48.086
What happened to those people?

775
01:04:49.421 --> 01:04:50.656
Vaporized or something.

776
01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:55.193
There's this interference.

777
01:04:56.294 --> 01:04:57.395
My field of view shifted.

778
01:04:57.429 --> 01:04:58.798
When it came back...

779
01:05:00.131 --> 01:05:01.131
They were gone.

780
01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.703
Oh, fuck you, man!

781
01:05:03.736 --> 01:05:06.304
You expect me to believe
this dystopian bullshit?

782
01:05:06.338 --> 01:05:08.018
They were just supposed
to get disoriented.

783
01:05:08.473 --> 01:05:09.675
Throw up...

784
01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:11.219
Quit fuckin' lyin', man,
that's not possible!

785
01:05:11.243 --> 01:05:12.010
I don't know, man!

786
01:05:12.043 --> 01:05:13.154
I don't have
any fucking answers!

787
01:05:13.178 --> 01:05:15.013
I don't wanna be here!

788
01:05:21.186 --> 01:05:22.287
What's with the headphones?

789
01:05:26.191 --> 01:05:29.695
It's like
a countering vibration.

790
01:05:29.729 --> 01:05:31.296
They said it's like
an inoculation.

791
01:05:32.264 --> 01:05:33.331
It's why we're still here.

792
01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:35.701
I listened to more than Alan.

793
01:05:39.538 --> 01:05:41.674
Yeah, that makes sense.

794
01:05:43.108 --> 01:05:44.509
Well, could it help him now?

795
01:05:46.746 --> 01:05:48.179
I don't think so.

796
01:05:48.213 --> 01:05:50.315
It's meant as a safeguard,
not as a cure.

797
01:05:50.348 --> 01:05:51.449
I gave it to him earlier.

798
01:05:52.818 --> 01:05:54.085
So what's next?

799
01:05:55.287 --> 01:05:56.087
What do you mean?

800
01:05:56.121 --> 01:05:57.589
How were you gonna
get outta here?

801
01:06:00.392 --> 01:06:02.160
They were supposed to
get me from the boat.

802
01:06:02.193 --> 01:06:03.562
But I can't reach 'em.

803
01:06:03.595 --> 01:06:05.139
The satellite phone they
gave me doesn't work.

804
01:06:05.163 --> 01:06:06.163
Where is it?

805
01:06:07.532 --> 01:06:08.834
Where's the phone?

806
01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:08.293
Come on, Meurs,
we gotta get you up.

807
01:07:09.662 --> 01:07:11.563
Clean you up, brother.

808
01:07:11.596 --> 01:07:13.198
Come on, now.

809
01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:46.736
We're gonnaet
out of here soon, okay?

810
01:07:47.465 --> 01:07:49.367
Longyearbyen's a
couple hours away.

811
01:07:50.468 --> 01:07:52.237
But, Alan, you gotta eat, okay?

812
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:54.406
Your body needs energy
to fight the infection.

813
01:07:56.008 --> 01:07:57.843
You gotta sober up, Alan

814
01:08:01.446 --> 01:08:03.515
What about Sean?

815
01:08:03.548 --> 01:08:05.685
He's coming with us,
he's got no choice.

816
01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.424
Listen, Ray.

817
01:08:13.793 --> 01:08:15.761
If something happens to me,

818
01:08:15.795 --> 01:08:18.964
I need you to say something
to Marie and the kids.

819
01:08:18.997 --> 01:08:21.667
No, no, no, no, fuck all that.

820
01:08:21.701 --> 01:08:22.743
You're gonna see 'em
in two days.

821
01:08:22.768 --> 01:08:24.301
You tell it yourself, alright?

822
01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.656
Oh, shit.

823
01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:49.995
Ray.

824
01:08:51.897 --> 01:08:52.897
I'm not gonna make it.

825
01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:55.835
No, no, that's not true, Meursy.

826
01:08:55.868 --> 01:08:57.402
It's just a mindset.

827
01:08:57.435 --> 01:08:58.446
You tell yourself you are
and you're gonna be fine.

828
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:59.939
Ray, listen.

829
01:09:03.008 --> 01:09:05.477
You gotta let me go.

830
01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:08.779
Alan.

831
01:09:09.682 --> 01:09:10.983
There are people that love you.

832
01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:14.252
And they depend on your love.

833
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.560
- Listen...
- Stay with us.

834
01:09:20.492 --> 01:09:21.694
You need to leave me here.

835
01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:27.066
Hey, it's... Ray, it's okay.

836
01:09:27.099 --> 01:09:28.332
- It's okay.
- No.

837
01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:31.089
It's what's meant to happen.

838
01:09:33.104 --> 01:09:35.741
It's what's meant to happen,
okay?

839
01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:41.345
I'll say "hi" to Cassie.

840
01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:43.881
What did you say?

841
01:09:46.551 --> 01:09:47.551
What did you say, Alan?

842
01:09:49.854 --> 01:09:52.758
Alan, I'm... I'm not gonna do
that.

843
01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.392
We're not doin' that.

844
01:09:54.425 --> 01:09:55.436
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna get in that boat,

845
01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.738
and we're gonna go
follow the coastline south,

846
01:09:56.762 --> 01:09:59.765
and we're gonna get you
to a hospital.

847
01:09:59.799 --> 01:10:01.767
And I don't care if you
agree with me or not,

848
01:10:01.801 --> 01:10:03.401
that's what we're gonna do.

849
01:10:03.434 --> 01:10:04.770
Now look at them.

850
01:10:04.804 --> 01:10:05.804
Look at them!

851
01:10:07.773 --> 01:10:10.609
And you tell them you should
be home soon.

852
01:11:04.562 --> 01:11:06.131
Hey, guys.

853
01:11:06.165 --> 01:11:09.500
Um, it's your dad.

854
01:11:10.636 --> 01:11:13.672
And uh, look, I know I...

855
01:11:13.706 --> 01:11:16.441
I looks pretty bad right now,

856
01:11:16.474 --> 01:11:19.645
but um, I'm fine.

857
01:11:20.679 --> 01:11:22.413
I'm fine.

858
01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:27.119
So uh, Ray and I, we...

859
01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.488
We ran into a little bit of
trouble,

860
01:11:30.521 --> 01:11:33.092
But... but I'm okay.

861
01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:34.126
And um...

862
01:11:45.905 --> 01:11:47.640
Dylan, I want you...

863
01:11:47.673 --> 01:11:50.109
I want you to take good care
of your mother, okay?

864
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:52.945
And Ruby.

865
01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:00.451
I love you guys so much.

866
01:12:06.692 --> 01:12:10.029
I'm gonna be home... home soon.

867
01:12:13.065 --> 01:12:14.033
Okay?

868
01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:15.634
I'm comin' home.

869
01:14:41.213 --> 01:14:42.347
What the hell are you doin'?

870
01:14:45.284 --> 01:14:46.785
Checkin' the engine.

871
01:14:54.059 --> 01:14:55.828
We've got a four and a half hour
boat ride

872
01:14:55.861 --> 01:14:57.729
over open water, Ray.

873
01:14:57.763 --> 01:14:58.964
We can't afford any fuckups.

874
01:15:00.232 --> 01:15:02.668
Right. Thanks.

875
01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:13.812
How did you get
involved in this?

876
01:15:14.913 --> 01:15:16.348
Old navy buddy reached out.

877
01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:18.884
I needed the money.

878
01:15:20.853 --> 01:15:22.187
Spend it wisely.

879
01:15:23.255 --> 01:15:25.157
Yeah.

880
01:15:27.826 --> 01:15:29.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What, what, what, what?

881
01:15:29.294 --> 01:15:31.396
I don't know, I heard something.

882
01:15:34.366 --> 01:15:36.010
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on, hold on!

883
01:15:36.034 --> 01:15:37.034
Relax.

884
01:15:39.738 --> 01:15:40.738
Can you hear that?

885
01:15:42.374 --> 01:15:43.408
Come on, let's go.

886
01:15:50.315 --> 01:15:51.950
Oh dammit.

887
01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:01.927
The bears look so friendly
on the signs.

888
01:16:20.412 --> 01:16:21.246
"We have your location.

889
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.915
Extraction in 30 minutes."

890
01:16:24.016 --> 01:16:25.017
Holy shit.

891
01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:26.951
They're coming.

892
01:16:30.522 --> 01:16:32.191
Alan!

893
01:16:32.224 --> 01:16:33.224
Meursey!

894
01:16:34.059 --> 01:16:35.059
They're coming for us.

895
01:16:35.894 --> 01:16:37.296
- Ray.
- We're goin' home.

896
01:16:39.398 --> 01:16:41.366
You're such a good host, Ray...

897
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.269
Everybody... everybody loves you.

898
01:16:44.803 --> 01:16:46.872
Everybody loves you, Ray.

899
01:16:53.345 --> 01:16:56.215
Okay, Meurs. Okay.

900
01:17:05.023 --> 01:17:06.291
How's this gonna go down?

901
01:17:07.392 --> 01:17:09.861
You guys hang back.
I'll go out and talk to them.

902
01:17:11.964 --> 01:17:13.232
What are you gonan say?

903
01:17:16.068 --> 01:17:19.137
I'm gonna tell 'em the truth.
There's two survivors.

904
01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:27.980
You better not fuck us.

905
01:17:41.126 --> 01:17:42.527
Okay, come on.

906
01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:48.399
Okay.

907
01:17:57.276 --> 01:17:58.810
I like it here.

908
01:18:00.045 --> 01:18:01.280
We're almost there, Meursey.

909
01:18:01.313 --> 01:18:02.381
Hang on for me. ok?

910
01:18:02.414 --> 01:18:03.482
Hang there.

911
01:18:03.515 --> 01:18:05.884
Yeah.

912
01:18:05.917 --> 01:18:07.352
It's getting close to time.

913
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:14.326
I'm sorry, Alan.

914
01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:27.571

01:18:33.412 --> 01:18:34.846
Yeah, we have.

01:18:36.248 --> 01:18:37.883
We're not done now, brother.

918
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.290
This is gonna be
our best episode yet.

922
01:20:05.504 --> 01:20:07.406
Alan, don't go.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:09.975
Alan.

924
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:12.611
