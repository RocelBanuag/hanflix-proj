Who would have
thought space travel

11
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:47.667
means doing nothing
but staring at monitors?

12

15
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.782
I'm relaxed. What makes
you think I'm not relaxed?

16
00:02:59.817 --> 00:03:01.011
I'm relaxed.

17
00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.150
Uh... is it meant to do that?

18
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:12.055
Isn't it supposed to, you know,
hold my body weight?

19
00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.361
Yeah, you're relaxed.

20
00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.031
I can see that.

21
00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.174
See, you have to press here,
and then it comes off.

22
00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.001
Yeah, but I didn't press
any button.

23
00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:28.641
- It just came off on its own.
- We'll be fine.

350?
I'm reading 150 meters here.

30
00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:48.826
They're way too fast
for their position.

31
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.833

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.249

Uh... Hannah.

40
00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:15.151
What the fuck?

41
00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:22.560
Shit, we see it now. The
station is about 90 meters away.

42
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:26.865
- I'm switching to manual mode.
-<i> Negative! Flying manually is prohibited!</i>

43
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.681
The thing they told us
never to touch, brilliant.

44
00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:31.209

get hit by the sails.

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:57.034

- Yeah, too close.

Wagner, your rate
is still too high.

58
00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:23.128
Yes.

59
00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:24.827
You better tell everyone
to hold on.

60
00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:25.991
Oh, fuck.

61
00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:28.598

62
00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:31.636
Okay, I'm on target.

64
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:38.867

See?

71
00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:32.327
What the fuck was that?

72
00:06:32.362 --> 00:06:33.998
Navicon was completely off.

73
00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:35.662
But it was not our fault?

74
00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:37.334
Nibra cannot blame us for that,
right?

75
00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.097
The station's readings
were right.

76
00:06:39.706 --> 00:06:40.736
Good.

77
00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:45.444
Wait a second.

78
00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:50.680
Wait.

79
00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.086
She's a soldier.

80
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:56.818
Why would Nibra send a soldier?

81
00:07:04.492 --> 00:07:09.293
Welcome to the Rubikon. Commander Wagner.
Dr. Abbot, glad to have you on board.

82
00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:12.196
What just happened, Commander Jenson?
Can you explain?

83
00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.237
The error must have happened
on ground control's end.

84
00:07:16.273 --> 00:07:20.105
Navicon somehow lost the connection to
your shuttle without a notification.

85
00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:21.975
Do you know why?

86
00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:26.912
Tracy will look into it
immediately.

87
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.015
And bring me the report
once you're done.

88
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:34.526
The crew cabins?

89
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.220
Yes. Um...

90
00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:38.761
Follow me, please.

91
00:07:45.537 --> 00:07:47.639
I hope you'll be satisfied
with your cabin.

92
00:07:47.674 --> 00:07:50.674
It's not much, but you've got
the biggest one we've got.

93
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.334
Oh, no, please...
that's really not necessary.

94
00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.412
I hope
your dad's okay about that.

95
00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:57.747
Why?
Did he ask about or...

96
00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:39.951
To the new crew,

97
00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:44.379
may you and the three others arriving
on Friday have a good time...

98
00:09:44.414 --> 00:09:46.625
and a productive work
experience together.

99
00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:49.727
Hmm...

100
00:09:57.327 --> 00:10:00.496
So I...
I... I hear you're a chemist?

101
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:03.006
Yes, but I've read all
of your reports and uh...

102
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:06.244
Sure, that's all you need to
conduct complex gene modification.

103
00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:10.040
I am sure you will do great.

104
00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:13.051
As long as you
can follow orders.

105
00:10:13.086 --> 00:10:15.546
My words exactly.

106
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.449
Commander, I heard about your
excellent navigational skills.

107
00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:23.624
Thank you. And I heard a
lot about you too, Doctor.

108
00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:25.160
Hopefully only good things.

109
00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:26.261
Yeah.

110
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.493
Commander, it's the laser comm.

111
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:35.630
Please, enjoy the party,
it's still my shift.

112
00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:42.777
How about we play one last game?

113
00:10:42.812 --> 00:10:45.380
Let's show the new ones
how it's done.

114
00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:46.685
Come on, new ones!

115
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.552
Sure.

116
00:10:52.588 --> 00:10:53.588
What are the stakes?

117
00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:54.926
Debit-points.

118
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:56.024
Okay.

119
00:11:06.469 --> 00:11:08.630
- Danilo!
- Uh-huh?

120
00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:11.206
Can you give commander Wagner
a piece of cake, please?

121
00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:12.841
Thank you.

122
00:11:12.877 --> 00:11:17.043
Sorry, commander,
my son takes this whole...

123
00:11:17.078 --> 00:11:19.608
being called off thing
a bit personally.

124
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.544
And what about you?

125
00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:25.651
I just want to see
what type of game you play.

126
00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:27.624
Whoo, I got seven.

127
00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:30.094
I'll take one...
No, make it two.

128
00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:34.791
Up to your liking?

129
00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:38.927
They are probably used to different
standards in the air-domes, right?

130
00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:42.806
Well, if you want your essential
amino acids and minerals covered,

131
00:11:42.842 --> 00:11:45.969
that's all you get, I'm afraid.
Sorry, domer-boy.

132
00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.405
Hey, what's your problem?

133
00:11:48.806 --> 00:11:50.538
Nothing.

134
00:11:50.573 --> 00:11:52.408
I just wonder what makes
an executive's son

135
00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:54.684
-want to come to a place like this.
- Danilo!

136
00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:56.249
Do you think I chose
to come here?

137
00:11:57.247 --> 00:11:58.983
To this old piece of junk?

138
00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.150
So then, daddy is punishing you?

139
00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:02.985
Why?

140
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.626
Did you misbehave?

141
00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:06.765
Is that my piece?

142
00:12:08.134 --> 00:12:09.361
Thank you.

143
00:12:12.705 --> 00:12:14.729
Commander Wagner.

144
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:16.808
A word, please.

145
00:12:22.215 --> 00:12:23.714
What is that?

146
00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:25.581
It's our new flight route
for tomorrow.

147
00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:27.745
What, why did they change it?

148
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.485
There is a strange fog cluster
in the northern hemisphere.

149
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.148
- Nobody knows what it is.
- Over Östgrunden territory.

150
00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:36.220
Wait, Östgrunden?

151
00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.324
Yes,
and there have been fatalities.

152
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:41.393
What? What happened?

153
00:12:42.335 --> 00:12:44.195
They can't tell yet.

154
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.865
Isn't Östgrunden
where they arrested

155
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.628
those green fighters activists?

156
00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.764
Were they the victims,
the green fighters?

157
00:12:51.268 --> 00:12:52.701
There were a few hundred.

158
00:12:59.217 --> 00:13:02.519
But they said they can
circumnavigate you around it, right?

159
00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:04.187
It'll take us half a day longer.

160
00:13:05.023 --> 00:13:09.621
Okay. Looks good. So...
tomorrow evening as planned.

161
00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:10.686
Okay.

162
00:13:26.512 --> 00:13:28.110
Come on, give me something.

163
00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:33.918
You know, we're not really
supposed to be in here, right?

164
00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:38.820
I can't find anything
on the Internet,

165
00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:40.490
there's nothing
on the cameras...

166
00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:41.959
so I thought I'd try this.

167
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.830
So... that's it?

168
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.863
This atmosphere analyzing thing
that never worked?

169
00:13:49.898 --> 00:13:51.397
I can't even get it to budge.

170
00:13:52.972 --> 00:13:55.999
You could have asked me,
I'm in contact with Nibra.

171
00:13:56.034 --> 00:14:00.236
Right, as if I believe a single
word a government company says.

172
00:14:00.271 --> 00:14:02.107
Come on, they're not the enemy.

173
00:14:02.143 --> 00:14:03.838
Uh, yes, actually.
Yes, they are.

174
00:14:05.113 --> 00:14:06.984
Of course,
not if you work for them.

175
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:12.990
You worry for your friends, huh?

176
00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:25.728
You're good.

177
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.918
All systems are online and ground
control gave their final go.

178
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:47.918
You guys are ready?

179
00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:48.993
Yes we are.

180
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.061
And the samples?

181
00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:54.757
- Dad, the samples.
- Mmm?

182
00:14:55.699 --> 00:14:56.726
Oh, yeah, of course.

183
00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.497
And these mother cultures will endure
the extended flight time, right?

184
00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:05.968
- Of course.
- Of course, yes.

185
00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:07.044
Yeah...

186
00:15:08.911 --> 00:15:10.740
That's our slot. Let's go.

187
00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:13.314
Commander Wagner.

188
00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:15.811
Jensen!

189
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.046
The son is on the way now
with the mother cultures,

190
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:18.609
but I'm pretty sure they've
been manipulated as well.

191
00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:22.343
<i>Well,
there's been a change of plans.</i>

192
00:16:22.378 --> 00:16:25.785
<i>The committee decided that we
want to move on to IKARUS sooner.</i>

193
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:28.584
Already, when?

194
00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:30.758
<i>Apparently in the next few days.</i>

195
00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:34.692
What? But I haven't been able to
investigate on the algaes breathing cycle.

196
00:16:34.728 --> 00:16:36.934
<i>Then you have to search faster
to make it on time.</i>

197
00:16:36.969 --> 00:16:39.703
If he finds out,
he might destroy samples.

198
00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:41.600
<i>Prepare IKARUS unnoticed then.</i>

199
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:47.771
Look, the station seems more interwoven
with the algae than anticipated.

200
00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:51.044
It could be
more complicated to just...

201
00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:52.974
<i>Wagner, just prepare IKARUS.</i>

202
00:17:58.247 --> 00:17:59.909
Hope you know that some of them

203
00:17:59.944 --> 00:18:02.546
were just exposed to high levels
of cosmic radiation.

204
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.247
I got instructed
on them very thoroughly.

205
00:18:05.283 --> 00:18:07.650
Oh, good, good.

206
00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:10.128
So you are aware
of what might happen

207
00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:14.094
when untrained personnel
enters without supervision?

208
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.057
- Don't worry about me.
- Hmm.

209
00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:23.768
Sounds urgent.

210
00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:31.210
Have they already landed?

211
00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:32.777
No, they're still in transit.

212
00:18:34.317 --> 00:18:36.646
Rubikon to Vesta 2,
what's your request?

213
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:39.146
<i>Rubikon!
You can hear us?</i>

214
00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:42.092
<i>We-We're running blind here!
We can't get contact.</i>

215
00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:43.952
<i>Neither to ground control
nor to anyone.</i>

216
00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:45.794
<i>Is the station
still transmitting our signal?</i>

217
00:18:45.829 --> 00:18:47.461
Jenson, calm down.

218
00:18:47.496 --> 00:18:49.530
I'll contact them
and get back to you at once.

219
00:18:52.134 --> 00:18:53.501
Rubikon to ground control?

220
00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:57.032
Ground control, do you read?

221
00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.774
Rubikon to Nibra North.

222
00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.386
Rubikon to Nibvision.

223
00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:12.652
What's going on?

224
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:14.819
We don't know yet.

225
00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:18.489
Where are they?

226
00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.292
- Jenson?
<i>- Wagner, yes, tell me.</i>

227
00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:22.261
<i>What'd, what did they say?</i>

228
00:19:22.296 --> 00:19:24.927
We can't make contact either.

229
00:19:24.962 --> 00:19:27.337
<i>What are you kidding me?
That can't be true.</i>

230
00:19:27.372 --> 00:19:31.132
We tried all staging posts
but no one was answering.

231
00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:33.968
Jenson, what about Navicon?
Are you receiving that?

232
00:19:34.004 --> 00:19:37.612
<i>It stopped just like yours
in the Vesta 1.</i>

233
00:19:37.647 --> 00:19:41.016
Wait, so they would have to
land without any ground AI?

234
00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:43.120
Wh... Are they trained for that?

235
00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:44.657
I... I mean,
we weren't trained for that.

236
00:19:44.681 --> 00:19:46.122
Don't... Don't worry, they...

237
00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:48.120
The...
Their course is preprogrammed.

238
00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:49.418
Right, Commander?

239
00:19:49.453 --> 00:19:50.819
- Yes.
- Yes.

240
00:19:50.854 --> 00:19:52.797
How much time
until they enter orbit?

241
00:19:52.832 --> 00:19:54.232
Fifty four minutes from now.

242
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:57.534
Okay, Jenson, we're on it.

243
00:19:57.569 --> 00:19:59.446
We're gonna find a solution to
get your connection to ground.

244
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.570
- Don't worry, okay?
<i>- Hannah, hurry, please.</i>

245
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.069
Doctor, send an emergency
signal to all stations.

246
00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:11.177
Even other company stations,
I don't care.

247
00:20:11.212 --> 00:20:12.448
Gavin, you come with me.

248
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.283
Maybe they aren't receiving
our signal.

249
00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:18.014
We have to check
the optical unit.

250
00:20:21.426 --> 00:20:25.120
- Point seven five bar.
- Check complete.

251
00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:44.504
<i>Dad,
have you reached anyone yet?</i>

252
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.606
Negative.

253
00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:48.944
<i>We're about to enter atmosphere.</i>

254
00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.049
Uh, good news are,
you are exactly on course.

255
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.655
<i>Yes, but only if no parameters
change on the way, right?</i>

256
00:20:55.994 --> 00:20:58.156
Hold on there, hold on there.

257
00:20:58.192 --> 00:20:59.220
You'll be fine.

258
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:04.120
<i>Do you see it, Hannah?</i>

259
00:22:05.893 --> 00:22:09.829
I'm about...
five meters away.

260
00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.916
How's she doing?

261
00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:29.914
Vitals okay.

262
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.489
Heartbeat slightly increased,
but that's normal.

263
00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:51.365
Do we get the test signal?

264
00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:57.545
Gavin?

265
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.144
<i>We're losing...</i>

266
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.117
- Doctor Kry... Jenson?
<i>- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

267
00:23:09.152 --> 00:23:11.218
<i>- To anyone!</i>
- Jenson, what's going on?

268
00:23:11.254 --> 00:23:12.468
<i>The capsule is heating up
uncontrollably!</i>

269
00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:13.964
<i>We're going to burn up!</i>

270
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.324
Gavin, can you hear that?

271
00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:18.660
<i>- The shell is about to break!
- Danilo!</i>

272
00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:20.729
Gavin?

273
00:23:24.504 --> 00:23:25.668
<i>Danilo!</i>

274
00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:26.734
- Vesta 2!
- <i> Danilo!</i>

275
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:30.481
Danilo!
Danilo, what's going on?

276
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:40.988
<i>Gavin? Gavin,
what's going on down there?</i>

277
00:23:41.023 --> 00:23:42.053
<i>Jenson?</i>

278
00:24:21.065 --> 00:24:22.731
Come on, open up!

279
00:24:28.103 --> 00:24:29.298
Fuck!

280
00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:44.550
It wasn't our signal.

281
00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.155
Down there everything is...

282
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.583
Hannah. The... the crew.

283
00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:49.659
I know.

284
00:24:55.992 --> 00:24:57.667
Rubikon to ground control.

285
00:24:59.368 --> 00:25:01.033
Does anybody hear us?

286
00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:06.643
Rubikon to ground.

287
00:25:09.144 --> 00:25:10.174
Anyone?

288
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:20.944
<i>Jenson?</i>

289
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:23.511
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

290
00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:25.216
<i>- To anyone!
- </i> -<i> Jenson, what's going on?</i>

291
00:26:25.252 --> 00:26:27.649
<i>The capsule
is heating up uncontrollably!</i>

292
00:26:27.684 --> 00:26:29.917
<i>- We're gonna burn up!
- </i> -<i> Gavin, can you hear that?</i>

293
00:26:29.952 --> 00:26:32.460
- <i>Danilo! Danilo!
- The shell's about to break!</i>

294
00:26:32.495 --> 00:26:34.159
<i>Gavin?</i>

295
00:26:39.137 --> 00:26:41.164
<i>Vesta 2?</i>

296
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.937
<i>Danilo! Danilo,
what's going on?</i>

297
00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:49.977
Sorry, I forgot the door.

298
00:27:00.617 --> 00:27:03.617
It's been two days and I haven't
been able to reach anyone.

299
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:08.160
The lasers can't get through
the fog in either direction.

300
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.503
Could it be the same
as in Östgrunden?

301
00:27:12.538 --> 00:27:15.065
Spreading across the globe
that quickly?

302
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.565
No that would take months,
not days.

303
00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.571
Well, I think we would have
noticed a meteorite or a volcano.

304
00:27:29.277 --> 00:27:33.084
And what if it was there before?

305
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.485
In the atmosphere
and just not visible yet?

306
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.759
You mean the Navicon problem
when we came up here?

307
00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:41.763
Nah. I've thought about that
too, but...

308
00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.599
That's why
I've been trying to understand

309
00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:46.863
this old atmosphere analyzer...
thing.

310
00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:48.171
And how's that going?

311
00:27:48.207 --> 00:27:50.302
Tsk... Really good.

312
00:27:50.338 --> 00:27:53.304
So far, I only found out that
it works without a connection.

313
00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:56.109
Well. Keep trying.

314
00:28:07.292 --> 00:28:08.726
<i>Dr. Krylow?</i>

315
00:28:10.085 --> 00:28:11.190
<i>Can I come in?</i>

316
00:28:16.527 --> 00:28:19.693
I brought you something to eat.

317
00:28:22.572 --> 00:28:24.969
<i>I know you're hurting but...</i>

318
00:28:25.005 --> 00:28:26.777
<i>We need to talk about the algae.</i>

319
00:28:28.713 --> 00:28:30.343
<i>Our oxy tanks
won't hold forever.</i>

320
00:28:30.378 --> 00:28:31.408
Go away.

321
00:28:35.545 --> 00:28:40.286
How far developed
is the gas exchange rate?

322
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:44.823
- Does the breathing symbiosis work or not?
- Go away!

323
00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:46.654
<i>How long can we stay up here?</i>

324
00:28:48.233 --> 00:28:49.198
<i>Doctor, please!</i>

325
00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:50.724
Go away!

326
00:30:54.126 --> 00:30:55.156
Gavin?

327
00:30:57.292 --> 00:30:59.688
Gavin can you come
and take a look at something?

328
00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:05.364
Gavin!

329
00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:32.261
Oh, fuck... Shit, shit shit!

330
00:31:32.296 --> 00:31:33.326
Doctor!

331
00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.330
Doctor, help me!

332
00:31:40.134 --> 00:31:42.896
It's an emergency!
Doctor, come!

333
00:31:46.102 --> 00:31:47.142
Hurry up!

334
00:31:51.977 --> 00:31:53.742
Doctor?
Come on!

335
00:31:56.322 --> 00:31:57.980
Shit! How long?

336
00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.448
He just entered.

337
00:31:59.483 --> 00:32:00.731
I'm trying to stop
depressurization.

338
00:32:00.755 --> 00:32:02.818
Just a second.

339
00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:07.157
Mhm, it has to empty completely
before we can fill it up again.

340
00:32:07.192 --> 00:32:09.164
No, that's, that's too long.

341
00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:13.870
What are you doing? No! No! No!

342
00:32:13.905 --> 00:32:15.409
I'm trying to bypass
the locking mechanism.

343
00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.469
No, no, no, no!
You'll destroy it!

344
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:21.477
Look, you can kill us.

345
00:32:21.513 --> 00:32:22.944
All of us, trust me.

346
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.312
Just wait it out.
Please, wait it out.

347
00:32:26.449 --> 00:32:27.479
Come on.

348
00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:33.881
Come on.

349
00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.191
Idiot!

350
00:32:38.157 --> 00:32:41.427
Okay, empty! Now fastest mode!

351
00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:43.066
Ready?

352
00:32:58.449 --> 00:33:01.177
- Okay, it's open.
- No, no, no, no! The pressure is still too much!

353
00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:02.946
Fuck it! Come on, help me.

354
00:33:09.286 --> 00:33:11.726
Gavin! Gavin?

355
00:33:11.761 --> 00:33:13.657
Hey, can you hear me?

356
00:33:16.392 --> 00:33:18.158
Mouth to mouth, come on.

357
00:33:18.193 --> 00:33:19.234
Okay.

358
00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:29.904
Five, four, three, two, one.

359
00:33:36.886 --> 00:33:39.155
Five, four, three, two, one.

360
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:45.161
Okay, again.

361
00:33:53.305 --> 00:33:54.863
Okay.

362
00:33:55.868 --> 00:33:57.569
Careful.

363
00:34:15.322 --> 00:34:17.583
Okay, that's not ripped.

364
00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:21.230
Is he... Is he gonna be okay?

365
00:34:22.195 --> 00:34:24.496
Uh, I don't know. Hope so.

366
00:34:28.498 --> 00:34:30.531
Why the hell would he do that?

367
00:34:30.567 --> 00:34:33.509
- Hmm?
- Why would he do that?

368
00:34:33.545 --> 00:34:35.337
I don't know.

369
00:34:35.371 --> 00:34:37.005
Frankly, I don't care.

370
00:34:38.243 --> 00:34:42.583
What's wrong with you? He just tried
to kill himself and you don't care?

371
00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:43.648
Excuse me?

372
00:34:45.482 --> 00:34:47.553
You know what? You do it.

373
00:34:51.495 --> 00:34:52.963
What?

374
00:34:52.998 --> 00:34:55.165
They didn't teach you that
at spy academy?

375
00:35:01.705 --> 00:35:02.733
Oh, yeah, I know.

376
00:35:04.608 --> 00:35:06.806
Know what?

377
00:35:06.842 --> 00:35:08.916
That your algae system is much more
advanced than you want to admit?

378
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.740
- Oh, that's a big surprise.
- Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

379
00:35:11.775 --> 00:35:13.681
I'm gonna tell anything
to a Nibra spy? No!

380
00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:15.886
It's not spying.

381
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.416
They funded it,
it belongs to them.

382
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:21.950
No, it doesn't!
It doesn't belong to them.

383
00:35:23.793 --> 00:35:25.019
It belongs to me.

384
00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:27.593
It belongs to Danilo.

385
00:35:34.102 --> 00:35:35.931
I'm sorry about your son.

386
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.801
Come on, you must be tired.

387
00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:44.610
Just go to bed,
I can take care of him.

388
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.860
Gavin?

389
00:36:38.793 --> 00:36:40.897
I closed my eyes for one second.

390
00:36:52.815 --> 00:36:54.917
Hey Gavin?

391
00:36:54.952 --> 00:36:56.484
Gavin, how... how do you feel?

392
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:12.963
- Let me check your ear...
- Get off me!

393
00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:14.033
I...

394
00:37:14.068 --> 00:37:15.305
I'm sorry. I... I...

395
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.138
Calm down.

396
00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:19.703
Y-You don't understand this.

397
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.804
- You need to lay down.
- This fog is toxic.

398
00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:24.246
- Okay?
- Th-These aerosols... They...

399
00:37:24.281 --> 00:37:26.081
- Calm down.
- They're all dead.

400
00:37:26.117 --> 00:37:28.843
- Okay.
- They're all dead.

401
00:37:28.878 --> 00:37:31.354
Nobody can survive this!
Dimitri... I...

402
00:37:32.152 --> 00:37:33.651
They're all dead.

403
00:37:33.686 --> 00:37:37.422
Look, look... Breathe, breathe.
Deep breath.

404
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:39.520
I can't breathe.

405
00:37:39.556 --> 00:37:40.660
Everyone down there.

406
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.430
Family? Friends?

407
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:18.533
You have someone down there?

408
00:38:20.563 --> 00:38:22.064
My little sister.

409
00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:26.607
Sorry.

410
00:38:30.607 --> 00:38:31.948
But it doesn't matter.

411
00:38:31.983 --> 00:38:34.010
We'll suffocate up here anyway.

412
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.523
We're safe here.

413
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:48.423
Okay?

414
00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:50.959
Danilo and I...

415
00:38:50.994 --> 00:38:53.700
achieved a working symbiosis
with the algae.

416
00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:56.373
We can survive.

417
00:38:59.238 --> 00:39:00.971
Thank you.

418
00:39:02.276 --> 00:39:04.007
For telling a Nibra spy.

419
00:39:06.213 --> 00:39:07.945
You're welcome.

420
00:39:10.756 --> 00:39:11.784
Where you going?

421
00:39:16.851 --> 00:39:20.156
Wow, you've been busy.

422
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:24.091
Even<i> if</i> the air is toxic,
there are bunkers.

423
00:39:24.126 --> 00:39:26.835
The lasers can't get through
the fog, but...

424
00:39:26.871 --> 00:39:28.400
maybe this can.

425
00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:30.630
I'm trying to get it to work.

426
00:39:31.874 --> 00:39:33.175
Is this?

427
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:37.012
The old ISS radio system,
exactly.

428
00:39:37.048 --> 00:39:39.273
That's ancient technology.

429
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:42.419
I mean, do you really think
anyone is still using it?

430
00:39:43.448 --> 00:39:45.750
I'll find out.

431
00:39:45.786 --> 00:39:47.985
I just need to reactivate
the radio antenna.

432
00:39:49.124 --> 00:39:50.489
Radio antenna?

433
00:39:50.525 --> 00:39:53.353
I... Well you can't do that
alone.

434
00:39:54.063 --> 00:39:55.091
Yeah, I know.

435
00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:57.357
Take a seat.

436
00:40:03.608 --> 00:40:08.269
<i>Look for a circuit
in sector... in sector B.</i>

437
00:40:09.441 --> 00:40:10.480
<i>Can you see it?</i>

438
00:40:11.774 --> 00:40:13.483
The cables are tangled.

439
00:40:15.611 --> 00:40:16.651
Okay, wait.

440
00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:20.451
I got it, affirmative.

441
00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:22.052
<i>Okay, so redirect it.</i>

442
00:40:24.285 --> 00:40:27.653
Have you seen all
this useless crap here?

443
00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:32.659
Ya, I've lived on the station for
eight years, I've seen it all.

444
00:40:32.694 --> 00:40:36.171
That's what happens when it's too
expensive to get rid of old parts.

445
00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:38.233
You just pile them up together.

446
00:40:39.242 --> 00:40:41.506
Your domer-friend was right.

447
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:43.843
This station is a junkyard.

448
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.149
Yeah, tell me about it.

449
00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:59.352
<i>When I was young,
astronauts were like gods.</i>

450
00:40:59.388 --> 00:41:04.430
Well, when you were young,
countries existed, so...

451
00:41:04.465 --> 00:41:06.769
<i>Okay, Doctor, it's attached.</i>

452
00:41:06.804 --> 00:41:07.804
Wait.

453
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.396
Very good.
By the way,

454
00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:14.043
you don't have to call me
doctor all the time.

455
00:41:14.078 --> 00:41:15.941
<i>My real name is Dimitri.</i>

456
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.407
I think
I'm getting a signal here.

457
00:41:22.116 --> 00:41:23.344
<i>Dimitri.</i>

458
00:41:26.324 --> 00:41:28.349
Give me a second,
let me scan it.

459
00:41:31.686 --> 00:41:32.727
Got it.

460
00:41:34.062 --> 00:41:35.092
Okay.

461
00:41:42.832 --> 00:41:44.566
Let's give it a try.

462
00:41:50.478 --> 00:41:51.911
Commander Wagner to ground.

463
00:41:58.947 --> 00:42:00.051
Can anybody hear me?

464
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:06.420
Please, anyone?

465
00:42:11.968 --> 00:42:12.998
Hello?

466
00:42:15.535 --> 00:42:17.574
Fuck!

467
00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.010
Gavin can't be right.

468
00:42:28.382 --> 00:42:29.619
She can't be dead.

469
00:42:43.025 --> 00:42:46.427
Open the door! Come on!

470
00:43:06.486 --> 00:43:08.082
Your ears hurt?

471
00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:09.818
I... I can give you
some painkillers

472
00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.251
for the... for the ears.

473
00:43:11.286 --> 00:43:12.992
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- You're sure?

474
00:43:16.732 --> 00:43:19.592
So there's no doubt
about what you said?

475
00:43:24.733 --> 00:43:28.645
The chemical structure of the
fog's aerosols is highly toxic.

476
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:31.114
It's lethal.

477
00:43:31.149 --> 00:43:32.847
Where do they come from?

478
00:43:33.745 --> 00:43:35.410
I don't know, uh...

479
00:43:35.445 --> 00:43:38.448
To me it seems like
some kind of... chain reaction?

480
00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:39.513
From what?

481
00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:42.482
Permafrost gases.

482
00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:45.926
We've been warning people
about this for years

483
00:43:45.961 --> 00:43:49.458
And now they've obviously
reacted with something.

484
00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:53.032
Maybe Toxins from the power
plants, some other pollution,

485
00:43:53.067 --> 00:43:55.563
maybe chemical weapons
from another corporation war.

486
00:43:55.598 --> 00:43:59.666
Fact is it's, it's all over down there.
We fucked it.

487
00:43:59.701 --> 00:44:02.278
Apparently, the economy was
more important than breathing.

488
00:44:02.313 --> 00:44:04.075
And what about the air-domes?

489
00:44:04.111 --> 00:44:06.742
They are for a very specific
molecular spectrum.

490
00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:10.011
Only a closed system with oxygen
tanks could shield them from the fog.

491
00:44:10.046 --> 00:44:11.916
But there are bunkers like that.

492
00:44:11.952 --> 00:44:14.415
Evacuation bunkers.
I trained in them.

493
00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:16.816
And what will happen
to the people in there? Hm?

494
00:44:16.852 --> 00:44:20.123
Sooner or later, they'll run out
of food, they'll run out of oxygen.

495
00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:22.589
Same as us.
We're all just living corpses.

496
00:44:22.624 --> 00:44:24.544
- Gavin.
- And I don't like the idea of a slow death.

497
00:44:24.568 --> 00:44:27.132
We can stay here
as long as we need to.

498
00:44:30.231 --> 00:44:32.071
The algae gas exchange works.

499
00:44:39.247 --> 00:44:40.278
No.

500
00:44:40.314 --> 00:44:41.344
Wha?

501
00:44:41.876 --> 00:44:42.917
No?

502
00:44:44.278 --> 00:44:46.380
Uh-uh, I can't live like this.

503
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:50.225
Stuck in this... in this
tiny metal can forever?

504
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.553
Maybe you two can.

505
00:44:52.722 --> 00:44:56.161
- I just can't.
- -Yeah and what is your alternative?

506
00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.362
You wanna try it again?

507
00:45:03.431 --> 00:45:07.237
Look... it's your life,
your decision.

508
00:45:07.273 --> 00:45:09.905
I just want you to know
that if you try it again,

509
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.847
you will also kill her.

510
00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:15.114
And me.

511
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.815
What, why?

512
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:23.156
I didn't tell you this yet, but the
system is designed for a full crew of six.

513
00:45:23.192 --> 00:45:28.160
They produce CO2 and the system
converts it back into oxygen.

514
00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:36.366
The bare minimum for an efficient
gas exchange is three people.

515
00:45:37.275 --> 00:45:40.601
Gavin, we need your CO2.

516
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.279
Can I join?

517
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.350
Okay.

518
00:46:35.466 --> 00:46:38.131
I'm mad at you, you know?

519
00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:43.268
For leaving me alone here
with this old grumpy cat.

520
00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:55.313
What? What?

521
00:46:56.587 --> 00:46:58.215
What?
What's so funny?

522
00:46:58.251 --> 00:47:02.590
It's... It's just that
I... I worked my ass off.

523
00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:05.619
Debit-point for debit-point.

524
00:47:05.654 --> 00:47:09.261
One shitty mission
after another and for what?

525
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:11.824
For this?

526
00:47:14.762 --> 00:47:18.600
I could have partied more,
like Knopf, or...

527
00:47:19.908 --> 00:47:22.439
taken a day off
every once in a while.

528
00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:26.146
Yeah.

529
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.483
I think I really screwed up
this whole life thing.

530
00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.159
Same here.

531
00:47:41.194 --> 00:47:43.760
You think
I was not screwing up my life,

532
00:47:43.795 --> 00:47:47.396
by going on protests and not washing
and cutting out T-shirts and...

533
00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.403
I'm really glad I did that now,
aren't I?

534
00:47:49.439 --> 00:47:52.169
Yeah.

535
00:47:52.204 --> 00:47:53.910
There is no planet B.

536
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:59.209
And Dimitri.

537
00:47:59.245 --> 00:48:01.583
Do you think
he was partying in his lab

538
00:48:01.618 --> 00:48:04.153
with his working symbiosis?

539
00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:12.795
Can you imagine
if they knew on Earth

540
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:14.428
that we were the last
three humans?

541
00:48:14.463 --> 00:48:15.963
Oh, my God!

542
00:48:15.998 --> 00:48:17.692
A bunch of losers and freaks.

543
00:48:27.368 --> 00:48:29.243
Me and my friends...

544
00:48:29.278 --> 00:48:34.478
fought so hard for a planet
that doesn't exist anymore.

545
00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.119
I have spent so long
believing in something,

546
00:48:41.154 --> 00:48:43.883
and now it doesn't...
mean anything.

547
00:48:46.994 --> 00:48:50.560
So the naïve activist is gone?

548
00:48:51.994 --> 00:48:53.035
Hmm...

549
00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.462
He...

550
00:48:56.497 --> 00:48:58.436
He was kind of an idiot anyway.

551
00:49:00.444 --> 00:49:01.769
That's too bad.

552
00:49:03.314 --> 00:49:04.640
I liked him.

553
00:49:49.416 --> 00:49:50.455
Dimitri?

554
00:49:55.299 --> 00:49:56.329
What?

555
00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:58.331
Is that normal?

556
00:50:03.569 --> 00:50:06.372
Eh, they never keep
the exact same green color.

557
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.677
How much longer?

558
00:50:08.712 --> 00:50:10.910
I'm dying this time for real.

559
00:50:10.945 --> 00:50:13.509
Two more minutes!

560
00:50:13.545 --> 00:50:16.250
Yeah, but... but brown?
That's... that's weird.

561
00:50:17.786 --> 00:50:19.484
It can happen if, uh...

562
00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:23.321
No, don't worry, it's fine.

563
00:50:23.357 --> 00:50:27.019
Oh, fuck...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

564
00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:30.429
That's it, I'm done.

565
00:50:30.464 --> 00:50:32.800
They'll have to wait
for my breath until tomorrow.

566
00:50:32.835 --> 00:50:36.135
Gavin, it wasn't 45 minutes.

567
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:38.197
Do-Do you even know
how long that is?

568
00:50:38.233 --> 00:50:40.520
No, of course you don't, 'cause
it's always Hannah and me peddling.

569
00:50:40.544 --> 00:50:44.403
Actually, I do know because every
morning when you cuddle, I peddle.

570
00:50:44.439 --> 00:50:46.013
At least 45 minutes.

571
00:50:46.049 --> 00:50:47.779
Maybe we should check that
on the CCTV.

572
00:50:47.815 --> 00:50:48.915
Maybe we should.

573
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.812
Okay, okay. What do you say?

574
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.649
Movie night?

575
00:50:53.184 --> 00:50:56.158
- Sure.
- What else?

576
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.163
Dimitri?

577
00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:12.603
Uh, yeah, choose something. I'm uh...
I'll come in a second!

578
00:51:39.065 --> 00:51:41.398
Sorry, guys, sorry.

579
00:51:41.433 --> 00:51:44.232
Oh, you waited for me,
that's nice.

580
00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:45.573
Where have you been?

581
00:51:45.609 --> 00:51:46.906
I just, uh...

582
00:51:46.941 --> 00:51:48.637
What are we watching?

583
00:51:48.673 --> 00:51:51.337
Nothing, if you can't reactivate
the Internet.

584
00:51:51.372 --> 00:51:55.208
Apparently, we've reached the end
of the internal movie library.

585
00:51:55.243 --> 00:51:56.284
Oh...

586
00:52:04.519 --> 00:52:06.754
I can offer you a drink.

587
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:08.630
More. More, more!

588
00:52:08.665 --> 00:52:10.127
More, more, more!

589
00:52:10.162 --> 00:52:11.626
Hannushka, it's enough.

590
00:52:11.662 --> 00:52:13.660
You had enough, Hannushka.

591
00:52:13.696 --> 00:52:15.834
Yeah, thank you...
Daddy.

592
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:20.233
- Okay...
- Of all your algae's functions this is definitely my favorite.

593
00:52:20.268 --> 00:52:24.239
Yeah, well, this batch is a bit too strong.
You can see that.

594
00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:27.780
If I'd known you had a whole distillery
in your lab I would have just...

595
00:52:27.815 --> 00:52:31.113
Yeah, you would just report me to
Nibra, wouldn't you, little spy?

596
00:52:31.149 --> 00:52:32.982
Yes, probably.

597
00:52:34.954 --> 00:52:36.153
Wait, what?

598
00:52:36.188 --> 00:52:38.052
Wait, you didn't know?

599
00:52:38.087 --> 00:52:42.823
Hannushka was sent by Nibra
to steal my mother cultures.

600
00:52:42.858 --> 00:52:44.959
What the fuck it's not...
No, not stealing.

601
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:46.878
- Not stealing. Just taking away.
- Steal is a harsh word.

602
00:52:46.902 --> 00:52:48.661
Take it away and steal.

603
00:52:48.696 --> 00:52:50.170
- No. No. No.
- Wh... Five weeks

604
00:52:50.205 --> 00:52:52.334
and you're only mentioning
this now?

605
00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.309
I'm so sorry, my dear.

606
00:52:55.006 --> 00:52:56.107
Take it.

607
00:52:56.142 --> 00:52:57.169
Three.

608
00:52:58.411 --> 00:53:01.176
You... You were hiding
the samples?

609
00:53:01.212 --> 00:53:02.482
I was helping.

610
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:07.622
A few months ago,
Nibra changed their contract.

611
00:53:07.657 --> 00:53:12.354
Suddenly they wanted the system to
be exclusive for their air-domes.

612
00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.253
And... I wouldn't mind.

613
00:53:14.288 --> 00:53:17.489
I would have taken the money,
which was a lot of money.

614
00:53:17.524 --> 00:53:19.935
Greedy fuck.

615
00:53:19.971 --> 00:53:22.802
Uh? Yeah,
and not ashamed of it.

616
00:53:22.838 --> 00:53:25.332
But Danilo, no.

617
00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.174
He was furious.

618
00:53:27.209 --> 00:53:30.168
He decided to make it
a public domain.

619
00:53:30.204 --> 00:53:34.412
He found some secret,
I don't know, distributor.

620
00:53:34.447 --> 00:53:38.449
Huh, actually sounds
like a good guy.

621
00:53:38.484 --> 00:53:43.490
Extremely annoying,
stubborn, rude.

622
00:53:44.652 --> 00:53:45.888
A little bit like you.

623
00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.531
Cheeky little do-gooder shit,
huh?

624
00:53:53.033 --> 00:53:54.061
Sorry.

625
00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:59.636
Thank you...
you know.

626
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.504
Okay, okay, show me
what you got, boys.

627
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.770
Ugh, yeah this is garbage.

628
00:54:05.806 --> 00:54:07.607
- No!
- Now you are gone.

629
00:54:07.642 --> 00:54:09.015
What the f...

630
00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.548
- Boom.
- No, Gavin!

631
00:54:10.583 --> 00:54:13.322
- Ooh...
- Fuck off, I... No, I am...

632
00:54:13.357 --> 00:54:15.954
- Hannushka, Hannushka, stop it.
- No! Okay, I'm... no.

633
00:54:15.989 --> 00:54:21.726
No! And you two should be so fucking
ashamed cleaning out the poor.

634
00:54:25.001 --> 00:54:26.931
I need to dance or I'll die.

635
00:54:26.966 --> 00:54:28.535
Oh, no.

636
00:54:39.983 --> 00:54:43.143
Gavin! Dance with the woman.

637
00:54:43.919 --> 00:54:45.418
Come on, dance.

638
00:54:45.453 --> 00:54:48.387
- Come on, lover boy.
- Please, no.

639
00:54:48.423 --> 00:54:51.817
- Please...
- Come... Come on. Come on!

640
00:54:51.852 --> 00:54:54.495
Move the hips, move the hips.

641
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.762
No! I think... I think
you should get Dimitri to dance.

642
00:54:58.894 --> 00:55:01.033
- Oh, gotcha!
- Oh, no, no!

643
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:02.567
- Come on!
- No! No,

644
00:55:02.602 --> 00:55:04.240
I'm a scientist,
I'm not a dancer, I'm not...

645
00:55:04.264 --> 00:55:06.045
- Yes you are.
- Yes, doctors can dance, come on!

646
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:07.183
You're definitely, definitely
drunk enough to dance.

647
00:55:07.207 --> 00:55:08.470
- Come on.
- Stop it.

648
00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:10.302
Come on, Dimitri. Yes.

649
00:55:12.377 --> 00:55:14.306
Come on. Yes.

650
00:56:32.629 --> 00:56:35.459
<i>If anyone else
is out there, please answer.</i>

651
00:56:35.494 --> 00:56:37.366
<i>We are a group of survivors</i>

652
00:56:37.401 --> 00:56:39.795
<i>in a bunker underneath
Nibra headquarters.</i>

653
00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:42.097
<i>If you can hear us,
please respond.</i>

654
00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:44.897
Gavin?

655
00:56:44.932 --> 00:56:47.135
Gavin? Hey, you guys wake up!

656
00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.105
Hey Gavin! Gavin, wake up!

657
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.008
Come on,
the laser comm worked again,

658
00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:57.280
I... I talked to one
of the survivors.

659
00:56:57.316 --> 00:56:58.578
Uh...

660
00:56:58.614 --> 00:57:00.381
Come on! Come!

661
00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.283
Dimitri.

662
00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:05.289
Hey, they're alive. There's...
There are survivors down there.

663
00:57:05.325 --> 00:57:07.056
Yeah, good, great...

664
00:57:13.732 --> 00:57:16.769
Rubikon to survivors,
can you hear us?

665
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.339
<i>Hello? Commander Wagner?
Is this thing working?</i>

666
00:57:22.374 --> 00:57:24.202
Oh, God.

667
00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:26.248
- Um, yes. Yes, it is.
- <i> Oh, my God.</i>

668
00:57:26.283 --> 00:57:29.048
And we're happy
to hear your voice.

669
00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:32.548
<i>Uh... This is Esther Chen-Kaminski,
I'm our representative.</i>

670
00:57:32.584 --> 00:57:34.380
How many of you are there?

671
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:37.823
<i>We're almost 300 here.</i>

672
00:57:39.557 --> 00:57:41.590
Was there an attack?

673
00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:42.998
<i>Honestly, we don't know.</i>

674
00:57:43.033 --> 00:57:45.094
<i>The fog came so suddenly</i>

675
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:50.131
<i>and people started coughing
and dropping, it was...</i>

676
00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.536
<i>But the soldiers brought us
into the bunker.</i>

677
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:54.873
But you are safe, aren't you?

678
00:57:56.211 --> 00:57:57.744
<i>No, it's the oxygen.</i>

679
00:57:59.148 --> 00:58:01.950
<i>We don't have much left.</i>

680
00:58:01.986 --> 00:58:04.850
<i>But I guess Krylow's algae system
is preventing that for you, right?</i>

681
00:58:07.685 --> 00:58:11.055
How do you know about the algae?

682
00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:14.426
<i>Well, some of us own stock
in this promising project.</i>

683
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:16.532
So you're CEOs or something?

684
00:58:17.826 --> 00:58:19.733
<i>And their families, yes.</i>

685
00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:23.935
Is there a Randall Abbot
amongst you?

686
00:58:26.108 --> 00:58:28.038
<i>I'm sorry, no.</i>

687
00:58:32.313 --> 00:58:35.548
<i>But, so these algae...</i>

688
00:58:35.584 --> 00:58:37.242
<i>The system provides for you,
right?</i>

689
00:58:37.277 --> 00:58:39.346
<i>I mean,
Dr. Krylow made that work?</i>

690
00:59:48.091 --> 00:59:49.654
Dimitri?

691
00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:51.451
H-He's in here.

692
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:53.591
Hannah was right.

693
00:59:53.626 --> 00:59:55.763
There are survivors, almost 300.

694
00:59:56.867 --> 00:59:57.924
Really?

695
00:59:57.959 --> 00:59:59.698
Yeah, but even better.

696
00:59:59.733 --> 01:00:02.501
There are these openings
in the fog.

697
01:00:02.536 --> 01:00:04.739
Very small ones, but still.

698
01:00:06.841 --> 01:00:09.911
- Hmm.
- -That's why they could hear us.

699
01:00:09.946 --> 01:00:13.514
They've already managed to transfer
their bunker's coordinates.

700
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:14.910
The next step
would be the Vesta.

701
01:00:14.946 --> 01:00:17.144
With Gavin's atmosphere analysis

702
01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:19.215
I might manage
to fly down manually.

703
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.817
- To do what?
- Their bunker provides enough oxygen

704
01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.421
for three more weeks at best.

705
01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:25.551
- Mm-hmm.
- If...

706
01:00:27.864 --> 01:00:30.930
If we could bring your algae
down there, we could help them.

707
01:00:33.903 --> 01:00:37.303
- Okay.
- Look, they're supposed to nourish a closed system.

708
01:00:37.338 --> 01:00:40.207
It doesn't matter if it's a bunker
down there or the Rubikon up here.

709
01:00:40.242 --> 01:00:45.406
Hold on one second. So, you're
suggesting we fly down without Navicon?

710
01:00:45.806 --> 01:00:46.847
Yes.

711
01:00:50.245 --> 01:00:54.048
We could save
three hundred lives.

712
01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:55.655
We think
it's a risk worth taking.

713
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.716
Let's say we,
we make it to Earth.

714
01:00:57.751 --> 01:01:00.819
- How do we get to the bunkers?
- They have mobile oxy-tanks.

715
01:01:00.854 --> 01:01:03.795
They could pick us up, also the
equipment from the Nibra Lab.

716
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:06.427
It's pretty close
to where we'd land.

717
01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:10.400
Oh, it seems like
you've figured it all out.

718
01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:11.966
Great...

719
01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.974
So what if I say no?

720
01:01:17.081 --> 01:01:19.705
What? Wh-Why?

721
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.285
You know, it's... it's
a little irresponsible.

722
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.217
And very, very stupid.

723
01:01:27.253 --> 01:01:29.956
Flying down without Navicon?
Are you out of your minds?

724
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.821
So what, we do... we do nothing?
We just watch them die?

725
01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:36.290
- Are you really that selfish?
- Ca-Can you stop with this green fighter bullshit?

726
01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.130
It's not one
of your awareness projects.

727
01:01:38.165 --> 01:01:40.825
We have to help if we can.
We have a moral responsibility.

728
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.499
My only moral responsibility
is to keep you and you alive.

729
01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.701
- That's it.
- Isn't this what Danilo would have wanted?

730
01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:47.702
To help people?

731
01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:49.903
Yes, he did.

732
01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:50.977
And now he's dead.

733
01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:56.015
But I'm here and I say,
"tough luck to them."

734
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.146
I know now how
to make mother cultures.

735
01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:03.083
So, we don't need your help.

736
01:02:03.118 --> 01:02:04.559
You're not gonna touch them.

737
01:02:04.594 --> 01:02:05.602
- Hey - You understand
what I'm saying?

738
01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:06.855
You're not gonna<i> touch it!</i>

739
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.896
Stop! Seriously, you guys.

740
01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.767
Sit down, both of you.

741
01:02:24.546 --> 01:02:25.913
We have to make a decision.

742
01:02:27.574 --> 01:02:30.043
It really doesn't make sense.

743
01:02:30.078 --> 01:02:31.945
Come on, we are fine.

744
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.479
We are good here.

745
01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:36.220
We, we can stay here
as long as we want.

746
01:02:36.822 --> 01:02:39.686
Really? That's your plan?

747
01:02:39.721 --> 01:02:42.687
Have you gone completely crazy
in that lab all this time?

748
01:02:42.723 --> 01:02:45.590
You don't get to talk to me
about crazy, mister.

749
01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:47.735
I am not the one
who tried to kill himself.

750
01:02:47.771 --> 01:02:50.130
How desperately are you
trying to do it again?

751
01:02:50.165 --> 01:02:52.331
Really? You're gonna go there?

752
01:02:52.367 --> 01:02:54.508
Hey, I'm not done
talking to you.

753
01:02:54.544 --> 01:02:56.277
Hey, Hey!
Come back! Come...

754
01:02:56.312 --> 01:02:57.340
Danilo!

755
01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:12.755
You okay?

756
01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:14.720
Nothing, it's...

757
01:03:19.402 --> 01:03:21.760
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

758
01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:28.107
It's nothing, it's just... It's
just your schnapps, I guess.

759
01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.121
What are you doing?

760
01:03:40.156 --> 01:03:42.858
Just a precaution, just want to
make sure everything is fine.

761
01:03:43.655 --> 01:03:44.684
Thank you.

762
01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:48.193
He's right, you know.

763
01:03:48.228 --> 01:03:50.657
What if those are the
last people on the planet?

764
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.969
Well.

765
01:03:56.005 --> 01:03:59.636
If these are the last people
on the planet Earth,

766
01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:04.444
maybe it's not that bad of an
idea, to start it all from scratch.

767
01:04:04.479 --> 01:04:07.209
Dimitri, come on.

768
01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:11.983
Okay. Tell me,
what have these people,

769
01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:16.650
these lovely CEOs,
ever done for you?

770
01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:19.928
They got me out of the dirt.

771
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.690
Hm.

772
01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:27.828
Yeah and made you a soldier
to serve them in their army.

773
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.564
You done?

774
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.081
Can't sleep?

775
01:04:55.223 --> 01:04:57.064
Is that her, Knopf?

776
01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.759
Her real name is Mia.

777
01:05:01.936 --> 01:05:05.036
This is the last message
I got from her.

778
01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.239
I'm trying to find out
where she was.

779
01:05:08.673 --> 01:05:10.872
Okay?

780
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.706
Knopf was stationed five hours
away from the Nibra central bunker.

781
01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:17.244
There are other bunkers
in that area and...

782
01:05:17.279 --> 01:05:19.845
she got an evacuation order too.

783
01:05:21.186 --> 01:05:23.321
That means
she could still be alive?

784
01:05:25.694 --> 01:05:27.358
Hannah, why didn't you tell me?

785
01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:31.395
'Cause it's... it's stupid.

786
01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.300
It's such a small chance.

787
01:06:12.741 --> 01:06:14.469
We're preparing for departure.

788
01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:17.012
Will you help us load
the mother cultures?

789
01:06:23.215 --> 01:06:27.278
Dimitri,
either you come with us or...

790
01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:28.452
Or you stay.

791
01:06:37.733 --> 01:06:39.934
What? In here as well? Eh...

792
01:06:39.969 --> 01:06:43.066
No, no, don't say
we're losing them now.

793
01:06:43.102 --> 01:06:45.232
Is this a trick,
to make us stay?

794
01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:47.135
No, it's not a trick.

795
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.637
It's really happening.

796
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.310
In the whole station.

797
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.043
Are they sick?

798
01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:55.784
That's what I thought.

799
01:06:55.819 --> 01:06:58.077
So what?
We can't bring them down or?

800
01:06:58.112 --> 01:06:59.153
Dimitri.

801
01:07:01.186 --> 01:07:04.091
- It's you.
- I make them go...

802
01:07:04.127 --> 01:07:06.188
I don't even touch them
without your supervision.

803
01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:08.129
You don't need to touch them.

804
01:07:08.164 --> 01:07:12.626
They feed from our urine
in the station's nutrient cycle.

805
01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:15.961
So they've changed color
because of Hannah's pee?

806
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:17.897
Exactly.

807
01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:23.738
Yeah, yeah, you almost got me.

808
01:07:24.314 --> 01:07:25.837
Come on.

809
01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:29.874
The algae is extremely sensitive
to hormones.

810
01:07:29.909 --> 01:07:31.917
It's your high levels of HCG
that do it.

811
01:07:31.952 --> 01:07:34.612
No, soldiers can't get pregnant.

812
01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:36.254
We don't even get our periods.

813
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:38.789
I'm... I'm sterile
till the end of my duty.

814
01:07:38.824 --> 01:07:43.092
Unless your hormone inducer loses
connection with its control unit

815
01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:44.660
for a long enough time.

816
01:07:55.173 --> 01:07:57.435
But the algae is fine, right?

817
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.674
We won't lose it?

818
01:07:59.912 --> 01:08:01.446
The algae is fine.

819
01:08:02.883 --> 01:08:06.752
That, on the other hand?

820
01:08:06.787 --> 01:08:08.321
If we fly down...

821
01:08:12.729 --> 01:08:16.496
These people need our help.

822
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:17.560
Come on.

823
01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:22.062
Wait, Hannah, wait.

824
01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.362
Stop.

825
01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:24.496
What the fuck, dude?

826
01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:26.801
He's right, he's right.

827
01:08:27.377 --> 01:08:28.407
Please.

828
01:08:30.078 --> 01:08:31.712
Start loading
the mother cultures.

829
01:08:31.747 --> 01:08:33.148
We're leaving tomorrow.

830
01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:35.413
I'll prepare the Vesta.

831
01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:36.943
Hannah.

832
01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:40.452
Hannah!

833
01:08:57.674 --> 01:09:01.242
Shit. Come on.

834
01:09:13.447 --> 01:09:15.287
Again?

835
01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:18.416
In case you didn't notice,
I... I just killed us.

836
01:09:18.452 --> 01:09:20.589
So, yeah, again.

837
01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.890
Yeah, but the other eight times
you made it.

838
01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.863
You're just getting tired,
that's all.

839
01:09:31.736 --> 01:09:34.738
This flight corridor
you gave me is fucking narrow.

840
01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:37.505
Well, then they're lucky that
it's you sitting in the seat.

841
01:09:44.287 --> 01:09:46.848
Hannah, I really think
we should talk about the...

842
01:09:48.086 --> 01:09:49.988
about all this.

843
01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:51.649
What does this mean now?

844
01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:54.053
Nothing, this means nothing.

845
01:09:55.895 --> 01:09:56.924
Hannah...

846
01:09:59.527 --> 01:10:01.735
isn't it likely that...

847
01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:02.835
Stop it, okay? I...

848
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.702
No! Fuck.

849
01:10:07.209 --> 01:10:09.341
I'm going to lose it
at re-entry or landing

850
01:10:09.376 --> 01:10:11.508
or without
the station's radiation shield.

851
01:10:11.544 --> 01:10:13.776
Okay, that's...
That's super fucked up, yeah.

852
01:10:17.448 --> 01:10:19.320
Sorry, I... I didn't mean to...

853
01:10:21.522 --> 01:10:25.320
It has no chance anyway,
I mean, even if we stayed.

854
01:10:25.356 --> 01:10:26.987
I can't raise a baby here.

855
01:10:27.963 --> 01:10:30.496
Just you, me and Dimitri?

856
01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:34.201
This changes nothing.

857
01:10:34.237 --> 01:10:36.271
It just makes
the whole situation shittier.

858
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.935
I'm sorry.

859
01:10:42.645 --> 01:10:43.674
I really am.

860
01:10:50.319 --> 01:10:55.252
Look, this one
probably doesn't have a chance.

861
01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:57.388
But, when we're down there...

862
01:10:57.423 --> 01:11:00.053
Are you saying
you want a baby with me?

863
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:04.431
Why not?

864
01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:07.863
I mean, imagine.

865
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.135
It'd kick butt.

866
01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:13.971
My brains, your muscles.

867
01:11:14.007 --> 01:11:15.035
Yeah.

868
01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:18.573
Yeah, you're right, I'm...

869
01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.810
I'm definitely too tired
for this.

870
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:25.980
Eight landings out of ten
must be enough, right?

871
01:12:18.865 --> 01:12:21.409
Okay, bring me the last one.

872
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:27.239
And this is really enough
for 300 people?

873
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.650
Yep, that's the minimum amount.

874
01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.816
What?

875
01:12:34.852 --> 01:12:37.117
Again, you think
I'm tricking you or something?

876
01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.957
It's just, you've not said one
word of resistance the whole day.

877
01:12:46.993 --> 01:12:48.736
What... What do you want
from me?

878
01:12:49.929 --> 01:12:51.470
You think I'm stupid enough

879
01:12:51.506 --> 01:12:54.902
to fly down with algae cultures
that don't work?

880
01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:57.869
I mean, I can't stay here
without you two.

881
01:12:57.904 --> 01:13:01.515
So, you won. Congratulations.

882
01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:04.276
What else do you want from me?

883
01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:17.261
Okay, all checks are done.

884
01:13:17.296 --> 01:13:19.332
Are you ready for this?

885
01:13:19.367 --> 01:13:22.393
Nope.

886
01:13:22.903 --> 01:13:24.965
Perfect.

887
01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:27.233
<i>Vesta 1,
flight corridor received.</i>

888
01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:31.608
Central Nibra, contacting
you again in 92 minutes.

889
01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:33.742
<i>Okay, we'll wish you
a safe journey</i>

890
01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:36.009
<i>- and we're looking...</i>

891
01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:38.910
And the contact window's
just passed.

892
01:13:38.945 --> 01:13:41.456
Okay, closing the inner door.

893
01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.389
Uh... What is that?

894
01:13:53.135 --> 01:13:55.529
The jets are not responding.

895
01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.641
Whoa...

896
01:14:06.048 --> 01:14:09.044
What is that?

897
01:14:09.079 --> 01:14:12.916
The jet tanks overheated but...
We haven't even ignited.

898
01:14:12.951 --> 01:14:15.583
- Overheated?
- The temperature keeps rising, but...

899
01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.155
fuck, that can't be right.

900
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:19.158
Hannah, what?

901
01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:20.589
We have overpressure.

902
01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:22.296
- Oh, shit.
- Makes no sense.

903
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:24.130
I need to release the tanks.

904
01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.060
- Did it work?
- The valves are not opening.

905
01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:31.668
- Try the gas outlet!
- I tried!

906
01:14:31.703 --> 01:14:34.371
They must have deformed
under the heat!

907
01:14:34.406 --> 01:14:36.240
How hot are the tanks?

908
01:14:38.077 --> 01:14:39.107
Hannah?

909
01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:41.843
Hannah!

910
01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:45.581
Unfasten immediately!
Get out now!

911
01:14:49.989 --> 01:14:52.819
- Come on!
- Come on, come on. Come on.

912
01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:54.084
Come on, we're gonna explode!

913
01:14:54.119 --> 01:14:56.156
Put yourself together.

914
01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.390
You put yourself together!
Come on!

915
01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.229
Go!

916
01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:11.042
- What the fuck?
- What?

917
01:15:11.078 --> 01:15:16.211
Look. The Vesta's cooling system
shut down almost 11 hours ago.

918
01:15:16.247 --> 01:15:19.720
That's why the tanks overheated.
I'll redirect the solar panels.

919
01:15:19.755 --> 01:15:23.090
Shadow alone won't do it anymore.
Look at the temperature.

920
01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:24.457
We need to decouple it.

921
01:15:24.492 --> 01:15:26.459
No. No, there has to be
another way.

922
01:15:26.494 --> 01:15:29.457
We can dump the tanks manually,
eh?

923
01:15:29.493 --> 01:15:31.358
That could work.

924
01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:34.063
Only from inside the Vesta,
but that's far too dangerous.

925
01:15:34.728 --> 01:15:35.829
Gavin, stop!

926
01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.563
It could blow up any second!

927
01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:38.639
Fuck!

928
01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:51.613
He has to go through the whole
cooling block. That's impossible.

929
01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.282
He's killing himself.

930
01:15:53.318 --> 01:15:54.380
All of us.

931
01:15:57.093 --> 01:15:58.450
Can you still decouple?

932
01:16:07.395 --> 01:16:09.804
- No, no, no! No!
- Wait! Hannah!

933
01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:11.236
No! No!

934
01:16:11.271 --> 01:16:12.530
No! No!

935
01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:14.966
Stop!

936
01:16:15.001 --> 01:16:16.776
Stop!

937
01:16:19.806 --> 01:16:20.946
No!

938
01:16:20.982 --> 01:16:22.180
No!

939
01:16:22.216 --> 01:16:23.310
Hannah, please!

940
01:16:25.118 --> 01:16:26.316
No!

941
01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:41.927
I had to.

942
01:18:35.408 --> 01:18:37.675
You did the right thing,
commander.

943
01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.547
He would have died.

944
01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:49.324
I know, doesn't seem
like much up here...

945
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.492
But, uh...

946
01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:56.100
this place saved our lives.

947
01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.271
Could be home.

948
01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:11.852
How was it for you?

949
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:17.055
Having a child?

950
01:19:26.464 --> 01:19:27.593
Loud.

951
01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.433
Nerve-wracking.

952
01:19:33.098 --> 01:19:34.765
Exhausting.

953
01:19:36.969 --> 01:19:38.274
Amazing.

954
01:19:43.147 --> 01:19:46.213
You can't possibly imagine
loving anyone

955
01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:49.021
like you love
this little creature.

956
01:19:58.298 --> 01:19:59.328
Okay.

957
01:20:30.556 --> 01:20:33.192
We don't need two people
to tell them.

958
01:20:33.227 --> 01:20:35.628
- But I was...
- Go or I go.

959
01:20:44.571 --> 01:20:46.771
Did you do it
because of the pregnancy?

960
01:20:49.276 --> 01:20:52.348
No. I did it because of us.

961
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.581
<i>Vesta 1?</i>

962
01:20:57.617 --> 01:20:59.894
<i>Vesta 1, we can't detect
your signal.</i>

963
01:21:01.396 --> 01:21:02.789
<i>Do you read?</i>

964
01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:03.854
<i>Vesta 1?</i>

965
01:21:05.225 --> 01:21:07.163
Yes, Esther we're here.

966
01:21:07.198 --> 01:21:09.134
<i>Gavin, where are you?
What happened?</i>

967
01:21:30.183 --> 01:21:31.552
What's IKARUS?

968
01:21:34.563 --> 01:21:36.194
They said that you would know.

969
01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:51.338
My actual mission.

970
01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.671
Once I found
a working mother culture,

971
01:21:53.706 --> 01:21:56.247
I was to bring down
the entire algae lab.

972
01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:00.846
It can be ejected
and flown down separately.

973
01:22:01.649 --> 01:22:05.155
- What?
- It was a secret military operation.

974
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:07.161
I'm surprised these CEOs
even know about it.

975
01:22:07.196 --> 01:22:08.196
W-Wait.

976
01:22:08.222 --> 01:22:11.262
C-Can we go down with it?

977
01:22:12.826 --> 01:22:16.127
It's not made for passengers
and can't be steered.

978
01:22:16.163 --> 01:22:20.000
Without Navicon we can only detach
it at a calculated moment and...

979
01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.437
hope for the best.

980
01:22:22.235 --> 01:22:23.867
But theoretically,

981
01:22:23.903 --> 01:22:27.179
we could board it
if we adapted it for passengers.

982
01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.544
Hannah, what the fuck?
Why didn't you tell me

983
01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.227
that there was another chance
for re-entry?

984
01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:35.517
Because it's not a serious option.
Okay?

985
01:22:46.635 --> 01:22:49.630
Three people against 300.

986
01:22:54.009 --> 01:22:57.275
Yes, or even more
if other bunkers made it.

987
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:06.614
I think we should do it.

988
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:09.149
If we don't try, then it's done
for them down there.

989
01:23:09.185 --> 01:23:10.816
We can't let that happen.

990
01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:14.028
This is bigger than us, right?

991
01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:19.165
Right?

992
01:24:40.613 --> 01:24:44.008
You, asshole, disconnected the
Vesta from the cooling cycle.

993
01:24:44.984 --> 01:24:46.714
We almost died because of you.

994
01:24:49.254 --> 01:24:51.851
I didn't want, I just...

995
01:24:53.156 --> 01:24:55.628
I just wanted a delay.

996
01:24:55.664 --> 01:24:57.230
It was an accident.

997
01:24:59.826 --> 01:25:02.532
Yeah, I didn't know
the valves can close up.

998
01:25:02.567 --> 01:25:05.130
I couldn't let what happened
to Danilo happen to us.

999
01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:07.370
Bullshit.

1000
01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:10.837
You just did it
because you're a selfish coward.

1001
01:25:19.513 --> 01:25:21.188
You know what this is?

1002
01:25:21.984 --> 01:25:24.088
Yeah.

1003
01:25:24.124 --> 01:25:26.122
And you know what it does?

1004
01:25:26.157 --> 01:25:29.193
I found out at some point, yes.

1005
01:25:29.228 --> 01:25:32.830
Good.
'Cause that's what we'll do now.

1006
01:25:32.865 --> 01:25:36.566
We will pump back the symbiosis
cultures in here and we will fly down.

1007
01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:41.973
So you knew about IKARUS
all of this time?

1008
01:25:42.008 --> 01:25:44.134
And you didn't say anything?

1009
01:25:51.116 --> 01:25:52.945
You didn't want this either.

1010
01:25:55.523 --> 01:25:57.216
Did you?

1011
01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.456
Gavin is right.

1012
01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.557
We need to help.

1013
01:26:02.397 --> 01:26:06.563
There is no shame in caring
for your own life, Hannah.

1014
01:26:07.933 --> 01:26:09.403
Especially now.

1015
01:26:09.438 --> 01:26:10.567
Stop it.

1016
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:21.675
Have you ever asked yourself why Nibra
needed the algae so bad all of a sudden?

1017
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:24.578
I mean, for years
they didn't give a fuck.

1018
01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.984
Suddenly they want everything,
now.

1019
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.549
They need the system now.

1020
01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.557
They send you to space
to get it, why?

1021
01:26:31.593 --> 01:26:33.189
Why, now?

1022
01:26:33.224 --> 01:26:34.888
What are you trying to say?

1023
01:26:36.664 --> 01:26:37.825
They knew.

1024
01:26:42.037 --> 01:26:45.272
They knew a catastrophe
was coming.

1025
01:26:46.765 --> 01:26:48.440
They just didn't tell anyone.

1026
01:26:49.602 --> 01:26:51.111
And why would they?

1027
01:26:51.146 --> 01:26:53.643
They didn't want to share
their bunkers.

1028
01:26:56.818 --> 01:26:58.715
Do you really think,

1029
01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:04.181
they would give you their algae,
if it was the other way around?

1030
01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:18.372
We've made a decision.

1031
01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:21.973
We're sending the algae lab
down to you, like you asked.

1032
01:27:22.009 --> 01:27:24.167
But we're coming with it.

1033
01:27:24.203 --> 01:27:27.938
<i>Okay,
we're looking forward to that.</i>

1034
01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.644
Wait, one more thing
before we start.

1035
01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:33.287
I need to talk
to one of the soldiers.

1036
01:27:35.418 --> 01:27:38.620
<i>But I am our representative.</i>

1037
01:27:38.655 --> 01:27:41.328
Yes, but IKARUS
is a military mission, so.

1038
01:27:42.456 --> 01:27:45.596
<i>Eh... okay.</i>

1039
01:27:47.995 --> 01:27:51.965
<i>The thing is...
there are no soldiers here.</i>

1040
01:27:56.445 --> 01:27:59.313
But you said the soldiers
brought you into the bunkers.

1041
01:28:01.616 --> 01:28:06.117
<i>Yes, they brought us here,
but... we have limited space.</i>

1042
01:28:06.152 --> 01:28:08.949
<i>We have room for 300 civilians.</i>

1043
01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.482
<i>Families.</i>

1044
01:28:11.518 --> 01:28:12.656
So what? You...

1045
01:28:13.885 --> 01:28:15.395
You just left them outside?

1046
01:28:15.993 --> 01:28:17.023
To die?

1047
01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:20.598
<i>They did their duty.</i>

1048
01:28:22.266 --> 01:28:24.036
That was Nibra's order?

1049
01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:27.405
For all evacuation soldiers?

1050
01:28:27.441 --> 01:28:29.772
<i>Hannah, it is your job
to keep us alive!</i>

1051
01:28:30.778 --> 01:28:32.878
You lied.

1052
01:28:32.914 --> 01:28:35.942
<i>No, we didn't lie.</i>

1053
01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:40.385
<i>You just assumed
what you wanted to believe.</i>

1054
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.983
<i>I'm sorry,
but what were you thinking?</i>

1055
01:28:48.362 --> 01:28:50.821
<i>All we want is to live,
nothing more.</i>

1056
01:28:50.856 --> 01:28:53.496
<i>We want our kids to survive.</i>

1057
01:28:53.532 --> 01:28:56.436
<i>I mean,
you can't blame us for that.</i>

1058
01:29:03.979 --> 01:29:09.779
Fuck! Ugh!

1059
01:29:29.268 --> 01:29:31.232
Come on, get off the floor.

1060
01:29:31.268 --> 01:29:33.229
No, I'm done.

1061
01:29:33.265 --> 01:29:35.738
Hannah, they'll run out
of oxygen within days.

1062
01:29:35.774 --> 01:29:39.037
Yeah, and why would
cannon fodder like me care?

1063
01:29:39.072 --> 01:29:42.342
They didn't give a shit
about me. Or Knopf.

1064
01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.011
Or my parents.

1065
01:29:46.152 --> 01:29:49.852
Apparently, money and privilege don't
get you a spot in the bunker either.

1066
01:29:51.956 --> 01:29:54.725
You know that there are
children down there too, right?

1067
01:29:55.887 --> 01:29:57.255
And what about this one?

1068
01:29:59.631 --> 01:30:01.661
You said that
we couldn't raise it here.

1069
01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.965
Why actually not? I mean...

1070
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.335
this place is better
than anywhere I lived before.

1071
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:09.337
Growing old here?

1072
01:30:09.373 --> 01:30:11.209
Never seeing Earth?

1073
01:30:11.244 --> 01:30:12.809
What kind of a life is that?

1074
01:30:14.212 --> 01:30:15.647
At least a life.

1075
01:30:22.782 --> 01:30:24.490
I... I don't get it.

1076
01:30:24.526 --> 01:30:28.159
Are you just hurt
or do you really want this baby?

1077
01:30:28.194 --> 01:30:31.363
See, I don't know, okay?

1078
01:30:31.398 --> 01:30:34.125
I never thought
about having a child.

1079
01:30:34.161 --> 01:30:36.960
Having a family
meant going back to being poor.

1080
01:30:36.995 --> 01:30:38.899
Not obeying meant being poor.

1081
01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.936
A soldier
doesn't even have that choice.

1082
01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.442
And that choice
is more important

1083
01:30:44.477 --> 01:30:46.373
than saving
the rest of our world.

1084
01:30:46.409 --> 01:30:48.512
Yes.

1085
01:30:48.547 --> 01:30:51.443
You wouldn't understand that,
domer.

1086
01:30:51.478 --> 01:30:55.083
For someone like you, it's
easy playing "Save the World."

1087
01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:58.082
But not everyone has a daddy
who sends him up here for safety

1088
01:30:58.118 --> 01:31:00.054
if everything else
goes down the drain.

1089
01:31:02.526 --> 01:31:04.190
Is that really what you think?

1090
01:31:08.264 --> 01:31:09.294
Huh.

1091
01:32:15.102 --> 01:32:16.565
Gavin?

1092
01:32:41.887 --> 01:32:42.926
Open the door.

1093
01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:49.526
I'm finishing what we started.

1094
01:32:50.568 --> 01:32:52.229
Are you leaving me behind?

1095
01:32:52.264 --> 01:32:54.665
No, but I just need
to finish up.

1096
01:32:54.701 --> 01:32:56.034
Just wait.

1097
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.908
How can you know
I won't stop you?

1098
01:33:00.776 --> 01:33:03.645
Because you're a good person.

1099
01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.377
And you know that this is right.

1100
01:34:42.217 --> 01:34:44.113
Hannah, wait! Stop!

1101
01:34:45.417 --> 01:34:46.417
Gavin, stop it!

1102
01:34:46.451 --> 01:34:47.418
Please, move!

1103
01:34:47.453 --> 01:34:51.989
No! Gavin! Gavin! Gavin!

1104
01:34:53.657 --> 01:34:55.324
Don't...

1105
01:34:55.359 --> 01:34:56.955
Stop it!

1106
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:58.358
I can't let you do this.

1107
01:35:19.654 --> 01:35:23.581
Hannah, can...
Can we talk about this? I...

1108
01:35:23.616 --> 01:35:27.420
I can't.
I just don't want to.

1109
01:35:29.726 --> 01:35:30.995
Hannah, please just...

1110
01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:41.599
Fuck!

1111
01:35:54.446 --> 01:35:57.285
Hannah, You can fix this, right?

1112
01:35:58.323 --> 01:35:59.457
Hannah?

1113
01:35:59.493 --> 01:36:03.687
I'm sorry... I wanna stay.

1114
01:38:40.584 --> 01:38:41.845
Gavin?

1115
01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:49.886
Gavin?

1116
01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:39.055
Come on.

1117
01:41:40.496 --> 01:41:42.795
Let's see
if we can fix IKARUS somehow.

1118
01:41:43.834 --> 01:41:45.699
Yeah, what?

1119
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.141
Why?

1120
01:41:50.574 --> 01:41:54.205
We need three breathers
or the gas mix collapses.

1121
01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.280
Your words.

1122
01:42:01.646 --> 01:42:05.884
You... You think Gavin did it...

1123
01:42:06.526 --> 01:42:07.858
Yeah.

1124
01:42:07.894 --> 01:42:09.558
He forced his will on us.

1125
01:42:11.061 --> 01:42:12.330
He got what he wanted.

1126
01:42:20.665 --> 01:42:24.100
- What?
- No... No, no, no...

1127
01:42:27.144 --> 01:42:29.281
We need three breathers, right?

1128
01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:41.288
Dimitri?

1129
01:42:41.323 --> 01:42:43.161
I said it after he tried to...

1130
01:42:43.197 --> 01:42:46.892
I just... I just didn't want him
to harm himself.

1131
01:42:51.706 --> 01:42:53.569
I wanted to save him.

1132
01:43:02.483 --> 01:43:03.940
Stop.

1133
01:43:03.975 --> 01:43:06.318
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Okay, just stop.

1134
01:43:36.949 --> 01:43:38.245
No, no, no!

1135
01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.483
<i>Nein, nein,</i> no, now.

1136
01:43:41.518 --> 01:43:44.316
- I got you. I do.
- No, no, no!

1137
01:43:44.352 --> 01:43:46.754
Let's go.<i> Pashli!</i>

1138
01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:51.092
Let's go!

1139
01:43:51.128 --> 01:43:55.791
<i>Eins, zwei, drei!</i>

1140
01:43:55.827 --> 01:43:57.930
You!

1141
01:43:58.706 --> 01:44:00.535
Good night, yes?

1142
01:44:00.571 --> 01:44:03.672
Okay!<i> Warte, warte.</i>

1143
01:44:50.315 --> 01:44:56.793
<i>Hello, hello?
Is there anyone? Hello? Hello?</i>

1144
01:44:56.828 --> 01:44:58.691
Hello?

1145
01:44:58.727 --> 01:45:00.495
<i>Look, guys,
the thing is working.</i>

1146
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:02.132
<i>Give it to me! Hello?</i>

1147
01:45:02.167 --> 01:45:04.864
Are you in there? In the box?

1148
01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.371
<i>No,
we are in the southern camps.</i>

1149
01:45:08.406 --> 01:45:10.541
<i>- And you? What's your name?</i>
- Knopf.

1150
01:45:10.577 --> 01:45:13.602
<i>- Knopf...
- Where are you?</i>

1151
01:45:13.638 --> 01:45:15.875
Eh... Rubikon.

1152
01:45:15.911 --> 01:45:18.216
<i>Can you play outside
there again too?</i>

1153
01:45:18.252 --> 01:45:21.916
No, Mom says
we can't breathe outside.

1154
01:45:21.951 --> 01:45:24.383
<i>So he must still be somewhere
up North.</i>

1155
01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:27.450
<i>Hey, shh. Well, then ask her
if you can come down here.</i>

1156
01:45:27.486 --> 01:45:30.193
<i>The grown-ups are always
searching for survivors anyway.</i>

1157
01:45:30.228 --> 01:45:33.794
<i>They say we must help each other
cause everything is different now.</i>

1158
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:36.493
<i>Stop it!
Seriously, can't you come?</i>
