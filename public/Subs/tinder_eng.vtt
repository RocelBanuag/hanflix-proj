01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.280
Hello.

2
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.160
Who are you?

3
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.760
We're journalists.

4
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.240
We're looking for Simon.

5
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.920
-You are not allowed to be here.
- But, Mom, come in.

6
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.440
So, you're Simon's mother.

7
01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.080
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

8
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.400
You're looking for him,
I'm looking for him.

9
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.200
He's swindled a woman in Norway
for a quarter of a million dollars.

10
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.680
I have absolutely no contact with him.
I have nothing to do with him.

11
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.600
I've not had contact with him
since he was 18 years old.

12
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.240
-But his registered address is here.
-He changed his name and address.

13
01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.160
He is not Hayut any more.

14
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.800
-So who is he?
-Leviev.

15
01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:58.920
Yes.

16
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.920
In 2017, he changed his name
to Simon Leviev.

17
01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.480
Before that, he was known as Shimon Hayut.

18
01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.040
But then he left Israel.

19
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.440
He forged a passport and left the country.

20
01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.960
Yes.

21
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.360
The Israeli authorities
demand that he be found

22
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:16.000
so the trial against him can continue.

23
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.960
And we're doing what we can
to find him and bring him in.

24
01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.720
She writes
that she's just landed.

25
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.560
We have a photographer outside the airport
who may be able to get pictures.

26
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.240
She writes, "My friend is picking me up."

27
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.880
That must be Simon.

28
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.640
I've now received a picture
from the photographer.

29
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.720
Wow, he's in Munich.

30
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.200
Hey, what's up? Good morning.

31
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.320
Good afternoon. Sorry.

32
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.400
I'm all right, and you?

33
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:37.920
What is it?

34
01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.160
I told you the truth.

35
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.760
I told you the entire truth,
I don't understand what did the--

36
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.400
Pernilla, you have no idea.
My enemies are trying to--

37
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.240
What do you know?

38
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.880
Something that I don't know?

39
01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.000
What do you know?

40
01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.760
What the fuck is this bullshit?

41
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.920
You double-cross me…

42
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.520
I can tell you right now,

43
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.920
you will pay for this
for the rest of your life.

44
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.520
This is your mistake. If you want
to make some claims against me,

45
01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.360
give me the evidence you have against me.

46
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.200
Nobody has confirmed anything.
That's not true.

47
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.760
Yeah.

48
01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.360
I paid for it!

49
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.960
Because of my enemies
I couldn't use my own…

50
01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.120
I have paid these people in cash.

51
01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.440
I did give them them money.

52
01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.560
Honey, what have you done this all for?

53
01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.520
There will be a price,
and I promise it'll be bigger than money.

54
01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.600
You double-cross me,
you're gonna pay for it.

55
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.880
