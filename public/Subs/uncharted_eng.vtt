3
00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.153
Oh, crap!

4
00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.418
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

5
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.121
That was purely reactive.

6
00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.894
Whoa!

7
00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.489
Whoa!

8
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.995
No! No!

9
00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.701
Come on!

10
00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.246
Nate! Come on.

11
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.413
I got you.

12
00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.348
Help! I'm falling!

13
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.786
I got you. Come on.

14
00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.223
- I got you.
- Oh, my God.

15
00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.991
- Hey, hey. Keep it down.
- Oh, my God.

16
00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:47.060
Hey. Hey.

17
00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.395
What part of "wait for me"
did you not get?

18
00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:50.897
I said I'm coming with you.

19
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.399
Okay. Okay.

20
00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.769
We're looking for
the Age of Explorers exhibit.

21
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:56.970
So be quiet.

22
00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.839
Bubble Yum?

23
00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:02.676
That's my last piece.
Let's split it.

24
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.779
Hey.

25
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.379
Punk.

26
00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.020
All right, smart guy.
Who's this?

27
00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.055
Too easy. Ferdinand Magellan.

28
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.858
First guy to sail
around the world.

29
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.962
Wrong. Magellan never made it
all the way around.

30
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.930
He just took all the credit.

31
00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.734
Holy shit. There it is.

32
00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:30.536
- What?
- Shh.

33
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.771
Come here.

34
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.242
First map of the whole world.

35
00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:40.579
You know what Magellan
was really looking for?

36
00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.183
Gold.

37
00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:46.286
But he never made it home.

38
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.257
So all that gold,
it's just gone?

39
00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.590
Whoa.

40
00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.525
Lost. Not gone.

41
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.394
There's a difference.

42
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:59.866
If something's lost,
it can be found.

43
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.003
But lucky for us, we got
pirate blood in our veins.

44
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.437
Descended from
Sir Francis Drake himself.

45
00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.075
At least, that...

46
00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.678
was what Mom and Dad
used to say.

47
00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.049
You know,

48
00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.285
sometimes I think
they're out there somewhere.

49
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.786
Like they're just lost.

50
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.587
They're not lost.

51
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.589
They're gone.

52
00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.427
All right.

53
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:31.631
This map is worth a fortune.

54
00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:34.701
Here goes nothing.

55
00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.538
Come on.

56
00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.074
- Let's go. Hey.
- Hey!

57
00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.776
- You two! Don't move.
- Hey! Hey!

58
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.411
Oh, crap.

59
00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.615
We came here first
out of respect, Sister B.

60
00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.549
But this is his third strike.

61
00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.153
Go get your things, Sam.

62
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.298
You can't just let them
take him away.

63
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.434
Say your goodbyes.

64
00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:13.273
What the hell?

65
00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.108
I'm not letting them lock me up.

66
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.508
No way.

67
00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.178
I'm coming with you.

68
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.980
Not this time.

69
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.383
Come here.

70
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.956
You see me go anywhere
without this?

71
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.624
No.

72
00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.794
So you know I will never
leave it behind.

73
00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:39.833
I will always be with you.

74
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.370
It says <i>"sic parvis magna."</i>

75
00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:46.039
"Greatness from
small beginnings."

76
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.509
That's you and me.

77
00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.312
Let's go, kid.

78
00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.691
I better get going.

79
00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.737
I'll come back for you, Nate.

80
00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.507
Promise.

81
00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.732
<i>Never forget, you're a Drake.</i>

82
00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.400
<i>I love you.</i>

83
00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:35.315
Oh, well, well, well,
if it isn't

84
00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:38.118
the late, great
and formerly employed Nate.

85
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.419
Well, at least you got
the "great" part right.

86
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.792
Hey, Goldie,
I brought your stuff up.

87
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.403
- Thank you.
- Hey, how was last night?

88
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:48.828
- Great.
- Yeah, he was cute?

89
00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.830
- Very cute.
- Nice.

90
00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.134
- Hey.
- Hi.

91
00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.635
Excuse me.

92
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.303
Sorry.

93
00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:59.105
Hey, what can I get you?

94
00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.508
- A vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic? Come on.

95
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.552
It's my first drink
of the night. Test me a little.

96
00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.078
Uh, I don't know.

97
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.546
A... A negroni.

98
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.679
A ne-what?

99
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.182
Uh...

100
00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:10.517
I'm kidding.

101
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.352
The negroni.

102
00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:15.889
First made in 1919
for Count Camillo Negroni

103
00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.724
when he swapped the soda water

104
00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.959
in his usual drink,
the Americano,

105
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:21.661
for gin.

106
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.932
Haven't seen you in here before.

107
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.500
It's not really my neighborhood.

108
00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.275
Not your neighborhood?
Where are you from?

109
00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.704
- Greenwich.
- Greenwich. Sounds nice.

110
00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.140
Bartenders up there
don't give history lessons.

111
00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:39.212
Well, bartenders in Greenwich
don't make negronis like this.

112
00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.754
You want to leave it
open or closed?

113
00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.190
Open, probably.
It's only Daddy's money.

114
00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.199
The cigarette.

115
00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:04.037
Invented by
Alfonso Cigaretti in 1462.

116
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.639
I'm kidding. I don't...

117
00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.874
I don't really know
who invented the cigarette.

118
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.743
You're kind of weird.

119
00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:12.212
But kind of cute, too.

120
00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.880
Well, then I'm kind of offended,

121
00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:15.649
but I'm also kind of flattered.

122
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.250
Here.

123
00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:25.391
- Come on.
- Y-You know what?

124
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.126
It's for the best.

125
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.861
I've been trying to quit.

126
00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.563
Well, maybe it's a sign.

127
00:10:30.698 --> 00:10:34.100
Or maybe you just need
to get one that works.

128
00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:35.301
This old thing?

129
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.104
Oh, it works.

130
00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.750
That trust fund ingenue...

131
00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.786
She was the right Mark.

132
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.360
Don't know what
you're talking about.

133
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.589
Sure, you do.

134
00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:58.659
You're going slow,
playing it safe,

135
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.460
not lifting too much at once.

136
00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.095
I mean, stop me if I'm wrong.

137
00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.496
Well, you're wrong.

138
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:06.499
And we're also closed,
so take off.

139
00:11:06.634 --> 00:11:08.968
Victor Sullivan.
You can call me Sully.

140
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.470
Thank you.

141
00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:12.305
I won't, but thank you.

142
00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.941
I got a job coming up...
a big one.

143
00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.610
I need another set
of hands on it.

144
00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:18.544
So this is what you do?
You stumble into bars,

145
00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:19.946
trying to pick up an accomplice?

146
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.181
I'm offering you
a real ticket out of here,

147
00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:24.550
a chance to see places
you only read about in books.

148
00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.419
What do you say?

149
00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:29.822
You missed the read, Victor.

150
00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:32.726
I'm not a Mark in some bar.

151
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.162
And some of us here would
really like to go home, so...

152
00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.097
get out.

153
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:39.767
Fair enough.

154
00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:50.443
Bye-bye, now.

155
00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.379
Hey, Goldie, let me get a beer.

156
00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:54.947
Sure.

157
00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.962
Son of a bitch.

158
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.736
Hey, hey, hey, get your head

159
00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:16.869
- out of your ass.
- Whoa.

160
00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.038
I'm so sorry. I didn't see ya.

161
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.573
Hey.

162
00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.274
I see Patience
ain't your virtue.

163
00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:56.844
Surprised to see me?

164
00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:59.747
Not even slightly.
I made you a drink.

165
00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.447
Shirley Temple.

166
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:03.950
That's hilarious.
And the bracelet?

167
00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.152
It's in the first drawer there
on my desk,

168
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.855
if you want it.

169
00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.268
But I think you're here 'cause
you got bigger fish to fry.

170
00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.525
Nah, I'm just here
for the bracelet.

171
00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.231
You done?

172
00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.032
No.

173
00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.602
Oof. This looks valuable.

174
00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:23.704
Now I'm done.

175
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.842
Why the map?

176
00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.543
Of everything in here,
that stopped you.

177
00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:32.388
Because it looks like
it might be authentic.

178
00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.046
Oh, not might be. It is.

179
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.048
Holy shit.

180
00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:38.786
This line here shows the path

181
00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:41.029
that Ferdinand Magellan took
to sail around the world.

182
00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.989
First guy to do it.
You know your history.

183
00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.858
Yeah, only he wasn't
the first guy to do it.

184
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.059
Magellan died in the Philippines

185
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.461
on a random beach somewhere.

186
00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.764
It was his captain,
Juan Sebastián Elcano,

187
00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:52.432
finished the trip
with 17 others.

188
00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.067
Also known as the Infamous 18.

189
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.770
I know the legend
that his voyage

190
00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:58.171
wasn't about exploration...

191
00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:00.440
it was about
finding that gold...

192
00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:02.408
but it's just a story.

193
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.478
No. I beg to differ.

194
00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.819
These trips were
hugely expensive back then.

195
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.486
The king of Spain
couldn't afford it.

196
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.888
There wasn't gonna be any trip

197
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.556
until a private financier
stepped in.

198
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.124
House of Moncada.

199
00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.425
Yep.

200
00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.628
Bankrolled the Crusades,
the Inquisition,

201
00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:23.262
Franco's fascists in the '30s

202
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.598
and just about every horrible
thing you can think of.

203
00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:27.835
They offered Magellan
his grand voyage of exploration

204
00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.069
so long as he came back
with that gold.

205
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.504
How much gold?

206
00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:33.306
Today's dollars...

207
00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.475
Five billion, easy.

208
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.144
It's the biggest treasure
that's never been found.

209
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.015
Look, I've been dreaming
about this since I was a kid,

210
00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:46.085
but somehow
you already knew that.

211
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.379
You know, when Sam said he had
a little brother who was

212
00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:49.989
just as into
this Magellan stuff,

213
00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:51.457
I thought, "There's no way."

214
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.960
Wait, you know my brother Sam?

215
00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.994
Oh, we were practically friends.

216
00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.898
That's saying something,
considering the company I keep.

217
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.565
Look.

218
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:01.935
Look at him.

219
00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.604
He has a beard.

220
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.071
Where is he?
When was this taken?

221
00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.240
Almost two years ago,
San Sebastián, Spain.

222
00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.308
We were getting close
to Captain Elcano's tomb,

223
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:11.612
where Sam was sure
we'd find his journal

224
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.847
and in it
the location of that gold.

225
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:15.314
Then he disappears.

226
00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.718
Doesn't call, doesn't answer
my texts, nothing.

227
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.352
He ghosted me.

228
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:22.522
Yeah, that sounds
like my brother.

229
00:15:23.724 --> 00:15:24.964
Oh, so he hasn't been in touch?

230
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.960
Sam? No.

231
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.394
Not even a postcard?

232
00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:34.534
No, not a postcard, phone call,
text message, email, nothing.

233
00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:36.679
Hey, look, I don't know
what happened between you two,

234
00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:38.204
but I think
if we find that gold,

235
00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.306
there's a real good chance
we find him, too.

236
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.742
What do you say?

237
00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.614
Sam left when I was 10.

238
00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:49.415
He would call
every once in a while,

239
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.785
swore he'd come back,
but he never did.

240
00:15:51.919 --> 00:15:55.022
The Sam that I knew
disappeared a long time ago.

241
00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:58.224
So, nah, you'll have to find
somebody else.

242
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:01.895
Wow.

243
00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:04.096
I'm really losing my touch.

244
00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:50.109
<i>Wish you were here, bro.</i>

245
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.514
<i>There's a whole world
you haven't seen,</i>

246
00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:57.084
<i>but you will.</i>

247
00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.719
<i>I promise.</i>

248
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.729
Hey, kid.

249
00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:44.196
What took you so long?

250
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.066
So, when do we start?

251
00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.102
There's an auction coming up.

252
00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.995
Biggest collection
of Spanish Renaissance art

253
00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.006
and artifacts
anywhere this century.

254
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.642
One of those items is
La Cruz de la Hermandad.

255
00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.811
Only it's not a cross.

256
00:17:57.944 --> 00:17:59.846
It's a key... a key that unlocks

257
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.649
the chamber where
the Infamous 18 hid their gold.

258
00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:04.743
Very cool, but the legend said
there are two keys,

259
00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:06.328
one for the captain
and one for the crew,

260
00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:10.057
so no one man could steal
the gold by himself.

261
00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.692
One key doesn't do us any good.

262
00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:13.425
You ever get outside
when you were a kid?

263
00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:14.536
I mean, how do you remember

264
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.029
all this shit?

265
00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:18.497
Only one thing:

266
00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:20.332
I already have
the captain's key.

267
00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.568
Second one's in there.

268
00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:24.838
The Augustine...
it's an auction house.

269
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.140
It's very exclusive,
but I got us on the list.

270
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.433
Look, all I need you to do is

271
00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:29.827
kill the power
during the auction.

272
00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:31.116
That'll trigger the main alarm,

273
00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:32.487
- and then I can do my thing.
- Okay.

274
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.346
And how am I supposed
to kill the power?

275
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.191
Well, shit, that's up to you.
I mean, you got to bring

276
00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.326
something to the equation.
I'm not cutting you in for fun.

277
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.494
Actually, that's a good point.

278
00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:40.878
We haven't spoken
about my cut yet.

279
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.388
I assume we're 50-50, right?

280
00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.801
Fifty-fif...? On what, the gold?

281
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.092
- Yeah.
- Are you high?

282
00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.669
You know this has been
years of my life?

283
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:47.761
You get ten percent,

284
00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:49.896
- and that's me being generous.
- Wow.

285
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.099
That's awfully generous.

286
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.201
What are you gonna do
with that kind of money?

287
00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:11.477
You still working on the tie?

288
00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:12.979
I just can't figure out
the length.

289
00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:14.614
I just keep making it all fat.

290
00:20:14.748 --> 00:20:16.016
Come here.

291
00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:18.985
You know what you're doing?

292
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.821
Yeah, my dad was a Navy man.

293
00:20:20.954 --> 00:20:24.024
I could do this one-handed
with my eyes shut.

294
00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:26.358
You served, too, didn't you?
Dishonorable discharge.

295
00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.861
Hey, you did some homework, huh?

296
00:20:27.994 --> 00:20:29.996
- Of course I did.
- I flew helicopters.

297
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.332
I was preserving some artifacts
from a museum in Baghdad.

298
00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.902
I was over the Max load weight,
crashed pretty hard.

299
00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:37.503
They got all upset,
kicked me out.

300
00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:40.173
Bit of an overreaction,
but what are you gonna do?

301
00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.374
You say "preserving,"

302
00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:44.510
but you mean looting, right?

303
00:20:44.644 --> 00:20:47.981
Well, if I didn't take 'em,
somebody else would've.

304
00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:50.583
- You asked for that.
- Thank you.

305
00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:52.052
And what's with the cat?

306
00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:54.221
Oh, the cat? She's just for you.

307
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.889
- What?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:56.022 --> 00:20:57.489
Your life seemed super sad.

309
00:20:57.624 --> 00:21:00.327
No, no, no, I'm not gonna
keep this thing.

310
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.361
They're gonna shit
all over my floor.

311
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.738
- Hey, wait for me.
- Hey.

312
00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:14.150
These people can tell a fake
when they see one, all right?

313
00:21:14.174 --> 00:21:16.343
You have to believe
the lie you're selling.

314
00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.510
You belong here.
You're one of them.

315
00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:22.414
Or you can just go with
the Bubblicious. Jesus.

316
00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:24.017
No, this is Bubble Yum.

317
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.995
It's the same thing.
Here, put that in your ear.

318
00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:27.754
No way.

319
00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:29.222
Hello?

320
00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:31.725
- Hello?
- I can hear you.

321
00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:33.226
I'm sitting right next to you.

322
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.762
Oh, shit, I think
I pushed it in too far.

323
00:21:37.264 --> 00:21:39.299
- Is it okay?
- Let's go.

324
00:21:42.335 --> 00:21:43.870
Oof.

325
00:21:44.004 --> 00:21:45.504
Look at that car.

326
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:46.907
Bet that ain't cheap.

327
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.541
Shit. Santiago Moncada.

328
00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:51.878
- Like the House of Moncada?
- Yeah.

329
00:21:52.012 --> 00:21:53.589
He thinks the cross is his
by birthright.

330
00:21:53.613 --> 00:21:55.315
If he buys it
before we can grab it,

331
00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.384
you kiss that gold goodbye.

332
00:22:04.858 --> 00:22:06.558
Welcome, sir.
What can I get you?

333
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.161
You know what,
I'll have a Martini.

334
00:22:08.295 --> 00:22:09.295
Yes, sir.

335
00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:11.765
- A Martini?
- Yeah. Why not?

336
00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:13.465
That'll go great
with the bubble gum.

337
00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:16.875
You should actually put
the gum in the Martini.

338
00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.283
You'd have a bubble gum Martini.

339
00:22:18.405 --> 00:22:20.407
- That's actually not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

340
00:22:22.609 --> 00:22:25.011
My God, this girl is
totally flirting with me.

341
00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:26.413
- Where?
- There.

342
00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:27.781
The woman with Moncada.

343
00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.316
Look, she's flirting
with me. Hi.

344
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:33.920
It's not flirting, all right?
Not with you.

345
00:22:34.054 --> 00:22:35.922
That is Jo Braddock.
You ever see her coming,

346
00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:38.457
you need to run the other way.
I'm serious.

347
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.428
She's coming this way now. Look.

348
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.263
Yeah, then you know what to do.

349
00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:45.899
You'll thank me later.

350
00:22:56.843 --> 00:22:58.510
Hello, Victor.

351
00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:02.015
Oh, what's the matter?

352
00:23:02.148 --> 00:23:04.284
Feelings still hurt
after San Sebastián?

353
00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:06.585
You're something else.

354
00:23:08.455 --> 00:23:11.024
So, what ridiculous scheme
have you cooked up this time?

355
00:23:11.157 --> 00:23:13.693
Well, if I tell you,
it'll ruin the surprise.

356
00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:17.697
Well, you do tend
to ruin everything, don't you?

357
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:20.133
I'm not the one
working for Moncada.

358
00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:22.534
I mean, that's low...
even for you, Jo.

359
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:25.405
Whatever gets me
the gold, right?

360
00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:27.173
Well, you taught me that,
Victor.

361
00:23:38.118 --> 00:23:39.252
<i>Increíble.</i>

362
00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:40.653
Whoa, Jesus.

363
00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:43.056
Oh, sorry.

364
00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:45.258
It's pretty cool, huh?

365
00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:50.163
Well, it's a one-of-a-kind
solid-gold altar crucifix.

366
00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.033
Handcrafted in Barcelona
in the early 16th century,

367
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:56.069
so it's... yes, yeah,
it's pretty cool, yeah.

368
00:23:56.202 --> 00:23:58.905
Wow. You know your crosses.

369
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:02.042
My family has been looking for
this one for a very long time.

370
00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:03.710
No way.

371
00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:04.911
So have I.

372
00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:06.479
Y-You are a collector?

373
00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:08.148
I dabble.

374
00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:10.050
I don't dabble.

375
00:24:10.183 --> 00:24:13.620
This cross has
a very tragic history.

376
00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:16.122
18 men died
trying to hold on to it.

377
00:24:16.256 --> 00:24:18.992
So much blood
so needlessly spilled.

378
00:24:20.527 --> 00:24:21.928
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:24:22.062 --> 00:24:23.830
if I could have
your attention, please.

380
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.331
Good luck to you.

381
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:27.067
Would you
please take your seats?

382
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.868
The auction will be
commencing very soon.

383
00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:32.072
<i>Hey, Bubble Yum.</i>

384
00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:34.374
You done chatting up
our archnemesis?

385
00:24:34.507 --> 00:24:37.343
I'm pretty sure he just
threatened to kill me.

386
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:40.547
Don't touch your ear like that.
You look like an idiot.

387
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.815
Get a move on.

388
00:24:41.948 --> 00:24:43.450
Now, most of you

389
00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:45.085
may be well aware
of the fact that...

390
00:24:45.218 --> 00:24:47.420
Gonna make my way upstairs.

391
00:24:47.554 --> 00:24:48.755
Are made from some of

392
00:24:48.888 --> 00:24:50.457
the most exciting items,

393
00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:53.059
many of which
are exceedingly rare,

394
00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:55.562
from our Spanish Renaissance
collection.

395
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.598
<i>Uh,
your girlfriend seems pissed.</i>

396
00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:01.043
Is that something
I should be worried about?

397
00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:02.602
<i>Just stay focused.</i>

398
00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:03.603
So, once again...

399
00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.905
Keep an eye on him for me.

400
00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:07.907
If you would, please come

401
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:09.242
and take your seats.

402
00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.244
Thank you very much.

403
00:25:19.552 --> 00:25:20.620
Excuse me.

404
00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:30.430
Okay, let's get started, then,
with lot number one.

405
00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:33.133
A magnificent oil on copper,

406
00:25:33.266 --> 00:25:36.604
"Our Lady of Good Counsel"
by Bartolomé Pérez.

407
00:25:42.775 --> 00:25:44.210
Hello?

408
00:25:51.284 --> 00:25:54.320
600,000, going once,
going twice...

409
00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:55.614
Sold to the lady in the back.

410
00:25:55.722 --> 00:25:56.589
Thank you very much.

411
00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:58.825
The cross is up next, kid.

412
00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.226
Um...

413
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.728
Sully, don't worry.

414
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:02.729
I got it.

415
00:26:02.862 --> 00:26:05.064
Ow.

416
00:26:05.198 --> 00:26:07.433
La Cruz de la Hermandad.

417
00:26:07.567 --> 00:26:10.270
Now, most of you will know
this was made in Barcelona

418
00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:11.639
circa 16th century.

419
00:26:11.771 --> 00:26:13.607
It is truly a gorgeous piece

420
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.143
and representative of
Spanish Renaissance gold work.

421
00:26:17.277 --> 00:26:21.548
So, we're gonna start off
tonight's bidding at 200,000.

422
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:23.283
Do I have 200,000 in the room?

423
00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:24.884
Thank you very much.

424
00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:27.720
I have an opening bid
of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada.

425
00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:31.090
Okay. Here we go.

426
00:26:31.224 --> 00:26:32.224
Do I hear four?

427
00:26:32.325 --> 00:26:33.560
How we doing?

428
00:26:33.693 --> 00:26:36.396
We're doing great.

429
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:38.031
500,000 it is. Do I have six?

430
00:26:38.164 --> 00:26:40.200
I have six.
Thank you very much, madam.

431
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:41.944
- I don't have all night.
- Do I have seven?

432
00:26:41.968 --> 00:26:44.404
700,000 from Mr. Moncada.

433
00:26:44.537 --> 00:26:46.439
Do we have eight?

434
00:26:46.573 --> 00:26:48.241
No takers?

435
00:26:48.374 --> 00:26:50.376
So, fair warning on 700,000.

436
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.945
That is 700, going once...

437
00:26:52.078 --> 00:26:53.746
Don't make me do this.

438
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.149
700, going twice.

439
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:57.917
And...

440
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:00.253
There we are
at the back of the room.

441
00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.289
Thank you very much, sir.
We have 800,000.

442
00:27:03.423 --> 00:27:06.694
800,000 is the bid, ladies
and gentlemen. Do I have nine?

443
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:08.728
<i>I'm spending money I don't have.</i>

444
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:11.064
Okay. Here goes nothing.

445
00:27:11.197 --> 00:27:12.832
Oh, God!

446
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:15.235
Ya shouldnae come out to play
with the big boys, wee'UN,

447
00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:17.804
'cause you're about to get
a proper Scottish welcome.

448
00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:21.307
I'm sorry?

449
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.747
Mr. Moncada,
it's back to you now... 1.9.

450
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.017
Mr. Moncada makes it
an even $2 million,

451
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.720
ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:27:32.852 --> 00:27:35.755
Well, train's already left
the station, right? Why not?

453
00:27:35.888 --> 00:27:37.223
2.1. Thank you
very much, indeed.

454
00:27:37.357 --> 00:27:39.292
Mr. Moncada, over to you.

455
00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:41.127
Any advances on that?

456
00:27:41.261 --> 00:27:43.963
2.2. We have 2.2,
ladies and gentlemen.

457
00:27:44.097 --> 00:27:45.965
Oh, God, here she comes.

458
00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.401
I said ya shouldnae come out
to play with the big boys,

459
00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:50.913
wee'UN, 'cause you're about to
get a proper Scottish welcome!

460
00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:52.740
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

461
00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:54.642
I literally have no idea
what you're saying.

462
00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:56.776
You little...

463
00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:02.482
2.2 is what we have.

464
00:28:02.616 --> 00:28:04.685
Do I have 2.3? He goes with it.

465
00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:08.588
Mr. Moncada takes it
to $3 million.

466
00:28:08.722 --> 00:28:11.090
Stupid door.

467
00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:15.295
Okay. Um...

468
00:28:15.428 --> 00:28:16.996
Oh, God.

469
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.330
Sully, I think you're just
gonna have to buy that cross.

470
00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:22.001
Fair warning.

471
00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:23.375
$3 million it is, going once...

472
00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:24.672
You better do something now.

473
00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:25.981
Kill the power,
fake a heart attack...

474
00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:27.507
I don't give a shit.

475
00:28:27.641 --> 00:28:29.175
Going twice...

476
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.245
And...

477
00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:34.814
Ah, this is gonna suck!

478
00:28:36.249 --> 00:28:37.651
Get back here!

479
00:28:37.785 --> 00:28:40.320
Get on him! Come on, come on!

480
00:28:40.453 --> 00:28:42.355
Well, that was something.

481
00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:44.692
- What's your plan now?
- Well, at least you fat-asses

482
00:28:44.824 --> 00:28:46.125
can't come out here and get me.

483
00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:47.360
There is a small situation,

484
00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:48.933
but I'm sure
we'll have it sorted out

485
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:50.530
- in just a second.
- Come on, careful.

486
00:28:50.664 --> 00:28:51.964
Can we secure the cross, please?

487
00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:53.466
- Thank you very much.
- Grab him

488
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.199
by the trousers
and get him by the balls!

489
00:28:55.268 --> 00:28:56.369
Security, can you go down

490
00:28:56.502 --> 00:28:58.137
and find out
exactly what's going on?

491
00:28:58.271 --> 00:29:00.206
You're doing great.
Hang in there.

492
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.975
Oh... Oh, shit.

493
00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:17.957
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

494
00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.194
Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me

495
00:29:21.327 --> 00:29:22.538
to take that
to the vault pronto.

496
00:29:22.562 --> 00:29:23.563
- Okay.
- Thanks.

497
00:29:28.468 --> 00:29:30.370
Everybody, remain calm.

498
00:29:30.503 --> 00:29:33.373
Sully, where you going?
You can't leave me.

499
00:29:33.506 --> 00:29:35.074
There's only one rule
in this game, kid:

500
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:36.542
Don't get caught.

501
00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:40.880
Excuse me, sir. We need
to ask you a few questions.

502
00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:42.692
I think that's a little rude.
I think I should be

503
00:29:42.716 --> 00:29:44.276
asking you the questions,
if I'm honest.

504
00:29:44.317 --> 00:29:45.762
Actually, you know what?
I'm-a do you one better.

505
00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:47.887
I'm-a get my lawyer
to ask the questions,

506
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.590
starting with:
Who installed that handrail?

507
00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:52.024
I mean, look at that thing.

508
00:29:52.158 --> 00:29:53.459
- Hey!
- Hey, get back here! Hey!

509
00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:03.903
Even more ridiculous
than I could have imagined.

510
00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:06.115
I don't know. I think it was
going pretty well so far.

511
00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:07.407
Funny.

512
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.041
I think that belongs to me.

513
00:30:09.175 --> 00:30:10.410
Jo, come on.

514
00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:12.412
Save it, Victor.

515
00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:13.647
- Save...
- Oh, thank God.

516
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:16.282
Guys, she's trying
to steal the cross.

517
00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:19.085
Just put down the case
and step aside.

518
00:30:19.218 --> 00:30:21.722
Yeah, put down my case.

519
00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:24.257
Step aside.

520
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.325
I'll get this
to where it belongs.

521
00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:28.094
Good luck.

522
00:30:28.227 --> 00:30:30.563
All right, lady.
Stay calm, all right?

523
00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:34.635
Sorry sons of bitches.

524
00:30:48.448 --> 00:30:50.450
All right, let's get
out of here, Tony.

525
00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:52.318
Hey. You surprised to see me?

526
00:30:52.452 --> 00:30:54.287
Well, you proved yourself
again, kid.

527
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.189
That was some swan dive
you took.

528
00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:58.157
You were just gonna
leave me back there.

529
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:00.451
Well, it wouldn't do any good
having us both locked up.

530
00:31:00.493 --> 00:31:01.994
Somebody had to get the cross.

531
00:31:02.128 --> 00:31:04.130
Holy shit, you got it.

532
00:31:04.263 --> 00:31:05.965
Hey, maybe I should
hold on to that for...

533
00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.400
What, you don't trust me?

534
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:09.469
Oh, is that supposed
to be funny?

535
00:31:09.603 --> 00:31:10.671
Here.

536
00:31:11.805 --> 00:31:13.272
Tony, take us to Teterboro.

537
00:31:13.406 --> 00:31:15.217
Unless you want to get
dropped off somewhere else.

538
00:31:15.241 --> 00:31:17.109
Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

539
00:31:17.243 --> 00:31:18.478
Sorry, Sully, but I'm all in.

540
00:31:18.612 --> 00:31:21.113
Hey, Tony, Teterboro.

541
00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:38.966
Wow.
Captain's journal. This is amazing.

542
00:31:39.098 --> 00:31:40.667
There's some crazy shit in
there, huh?

543
00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:43.236
It's unbelievable. I mean,
it totally confirms the legend.

544
00:31:43.369 --> 00:31:45.672
Magellan did find tons of gold
in the Philippines.

545
00:31:45.806 --> 00:31:47.306
They hid the gold in Barcelona

546
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.509
and then told the Moncadas
that the trip was a bust.

547
00:31:49.643 --> 00:31:52.478
Okay, well, you have any bright
ideas on how to use the keys?

548
00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:54.514
Yeah, here. The captain wrote,

549
00:31:54.648 --> 00:31:58.217
"The path begins in Barcelona
where the keys turn into pine."

550
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:02.288
And then there's a sketch here
of a pine tree. Here.

551
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:06.225
So we're looking for a tree.

552
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:09.997
- Really?
- Yeah.

553
00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:12.465
Wow.
That's your expert analysis?

554
00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:14.209
Well, you just gave me the book
like an hour ago.

555
00:32:14.233 --> 00:32:15.334
What am I supposed to do?

556
00:32:15.468 --> 00:32:17.336
I mean,
I got that far on my own.

557
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.673
I've seen the picture
of the tree. Where's the gold?

558
00:32:19.806 --> 00:32:21.742
Is it under the tree?
Is it in the tree?

559
00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:23.753
- I don't know. Could be.
- Look out the window.

560
00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:26.013
There's a lot of trees
in Barcelona.

561
00:32:31.517 --> 00:32:33.286
All right,
anything you need in Barcelona,

562
00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:34.788
Chloe Frazer can get it.

563
00:32:34.922 --> 00:32:36.823
I didn't tell her
about you yet, but she's cool.

564
00:32:36.957 --> 00:32:38.324
Hey, Chlo.

565
00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:39.559
Who the hell is this?

566
00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:44.096
I'm Nate.
I'm a friend of Sully's.

567
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.966
Sully doesn't have any friends.

568
00:32:46.098 --> 00:32:47.533
I should know. I'm one of them.

569
00:32:47.668 --> 00:32:48.948
That's not true. People love me.

570
00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:50.369
And what's with the spy games?

571
00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:51.823
Why couldn't we meet
at the house?

572
00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:53.459
I was making sure
you weren't followed.

573
00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:56.075
Come on, you don't think
I can spot a tail?

574
00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:57.808
Mate, I've been on you
since the airport.

575
00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:00.079
Really? All the way
from the airport?

576
00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:01.213
Look, it doesn't matter.

577
00:33:01.347 --> 00:33:03.316
Why is he here?

578
00:33:03.449 --> 00:33:05.251
Why am I...? Why are you here?

579
00:33:05.384 --> 00:33:07.054
Clearly, you didn't tell him.

580
00:33:08.187 --> 00:33:09.388
Chloe has the other cross.

581
00:33:09.522 --> 00:33:11.190
- What?
- Did I not mention that?

582
00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:13.225
- No, you didn't.
- Are you sure? Well, look,

583
00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:15.028
- it's mine, basically, all right?
- Okay.

584
00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:16.538
So we're all gonna be
partners on this thing.

585
00:33:16.562 --> 00:33:18.106
That's the way it's happening,
so get used to it.

586
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.833
No, we're not.

587
00:33:19.967 --> 00:33:22.134
Look, word to the unwise...

588
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:23.937
everything
out of this one's mouth

589
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.973
is an exaggeration, a half-truth

590
00:33:26.105 --> 00:33:27.585
- or an outright lie.
- You know what?

591
00:33:27.674 --> 00:33:29.575
That is not true.

592
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.044
See ya, Sully.

593
00:33:31.177 --> 00:33:33.981
That's... Come on, Chlo.

594
00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:35.682
She'll come back. She has to.

595
00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:39.397
I don't think she's coming back.

596
00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:40.518
So?

597
00:33:40.621 --> 00:33:42.723
- Where's the cross?
- It's in my bag.

598
00:33:42.856 --> 00:33:44.323
Check your bag. Do it now.

599
00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:46.125
Shit.

600
00:33:50.664 --> 00:33:52.441
You let her take the cross?
You let her take the cross.

601
00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:55.568
- Shit.
- You better get that cross back!

602
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:57.582
You got to be kidding me.
What a rookie mistake.

603
00:34:13.754 --> 00:34:15.521
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

604
00:34:15.656 --> 00:34:17.699
- Could you move any slower?!
- I got a bad ankle, kid.

605
00:34:17.724 --> 00:34:19.492
I can't be
running around out here.

606
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.003
Oh, shit!

607
00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:35.306
Move!

608
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.443
Out of the way!
Move, move, move!

609
00:34:38.745 --> 00:34:39.745
Move!

610
00:35:06.707 --> 00:35:08.947
Listen! You don't know where
you're going with them keys!

611
00:35:09.009 --> 00:35:10.911
Look, you're looking
for a tree, right?

612
00:35:11.044 --> 00:35:12.511
Piss off.

613
00:35:12.646 --> 00:35:14.580
Listen to me.

614
00:35:14.715 --> 00:35:17.216
The 18 were willing to wait
years to go back for the gold.

615
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.218
They wouldn't have picked
a tree as a marker.

616
00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:21.587
They would have picked
something more permanent.

617
00:35:21.722 --> 00:35:23.190
You're full of shit.

618
00:35:23.322 --> 00:35:24.925
Hey.

619
00:35:25.058 --> 00:35:26.258
Let her go.

620
00:35:26.392 --> 00:35:27.728
She knows where to use the keys,

621
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:29.295
then she doesn't need us, right?

622
00:35:29.428 --> 00:35:31.297
Okay. Be my guest.
Get out of here.

623
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.766
Thank you.

624
00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:35.401
Bye.

625
00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:47.180
If it's not a tree, what is it?

626
00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:50.117
At the auction house, Moncada
called it an "altar crucifix."

627
00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:52.551
I didn't think about it then,
but it means that the cross

628
00:35:52.686 --> 00:35:54.553
was originally made
to stand on an altar.

629
00:35:56.422 --> 00:35:57.991
In a church.

630
00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:00.392
Which church?

631
00:36:00.526 --> 00:36:01.895
God, you guys never stop,
do you?

632
00:36:02.028 --> 00:36:03.630
Look, if we want
to get the gold,

633
00:36:03.764 --> 00:36:06.133
we're gonna have to figure out
a way to trust each other.

634
00:36:07.366 --> 00:36:09.035
So give me the key.

635
00:36:12.606 --> 00:36:14.440
Which church?

636
00:36:16.943 --> 00:36:18.745
Santa Maria del Pi.

637
00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:21.047
Saint Mary of the Pine.

638
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:22.581
This has to be it.

639
00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:24.583
You might just be a genius.

640
00:36:24.718 --> 00:36:26.086
"Genius" is a stretch.

641
00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:28.989
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

642
00:36:29.122 --> 00:36:30.657
Now you know why I brought him.

643
00:36:30.791 --> 00:36:32.525
Hmm.

644
00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:35.162
Okay. Good work.

645
00:36:35.294 --> 00:36:37.964
I'll go see when we might have
a private look inside.

646
00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:44.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't even think about it.

647
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.006
- What?
- Well, you don't catch on

648
00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:47.974
too quick, do you?
She's not to be trusted.

649
00:36:48.108 --> 00:36:49.341
You met her for two minutes,

650
00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:51.343
she already stole
the cross from you.

651
00:36:51.477 --> 00:36:53.280
She's coming back.

652
00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:54.848
There's a midnight mass tonight,

653
00:36:54.981 --> 00:36:56.850
so tomorrow's the earliest
we can poke around.

654
00:36:56.983 --> 00:36:58.517
You got our gear at the
house, right?

655
00:36:58.652 --> 00:36:59.853
Yeah. Come on.

656
00:37:04.523 --> 00:37:05.523
Father.

657
00:37:07.127 --> 00:37:09.229
You said we were going to
discuss this.

658
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:12.032
I changed my mind.

659
00:37:12.766 --> 00:37:14.201
I'm allowed.

660
00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.505
It's not yours to give.

661
00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:23.210
You built none of it - they did.

662
00:37:23.342 --> 00:37:25.212
Our fortune is dipped in blood.

663
00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:29.582
And giving it all away
will release that stain?

664
00:37:32.052 --> 00:37:36.422
I should have cut you off
years ago.

665
00:37:44.998 --> 00:37:47.067
Ms. Braddock.

666
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.303
Welcome to Barcelona
as my ancestors knew it.

667
00:37:50.436 --> 00:37:51.805
Quite something, isn't it?

668
00:37:51.938 --> 00:37:54.573
Yes, it's truly
an impressive excavation.

669
00:37:54.708 --> 00:37:56.343
Yeah.

670
00:37:56.475 --> 00:38:00.046
This competitor of yours,
Victor Sullivan...

671
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.015
maybe he's the one
I should have hired.

672
00:38:02.148 --> 00:38:04.351
Victor Sullivan is
a liar and a fraud.

673
00:38:04.483 --> 00:38:06.286
Any deal you make with him
is worthless.

674
00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:08.454
Perhaps.

675
00:38:08.587 --> 00:38:10.456
But I've been told, uh,

676
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:13.592
he was seen
in the Barrio Gótico.

677
00:38:13.727 --> 00:38:16.363
Maybe you should look into it.

678
00:38:16.495 --> 00:38:17.697
Yes, sir.

679
00:38:18.832 --> 00:38:20.267
Good.

680
00:38:32.746 --> 00:38:36.216
I found my cross
in a crypt in Genoa,

681
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:38.818
but I didn't know it was a key
to a much bigger fortune.

682
00:38:38.952 --> 00:38:40.120
Sully knew.

683
00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:44.257
Doesn't say what happens
after we turn the keys.

684
00:38:44.391 --> 00:38:46.726
"Trust in your fellow man,
for one will

685
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.895
go to heaven
and the other to hell."

686
00:38:49.029 --> 00:38:51.031
Well, it's ironic,

687
00:38:51.164 --> 00:38:53.733
seeing as the only point
in having two keys

688
00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:56.369
was that the 18
didn't trust each other.

689
00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:59.739
Well, good thing they didn't,
or we wouldn't be here, right?

690
00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:02.474
Like one big happy family.

691
00:39:02.609 --> 00:39:04.177
Toast?

692
00:39:04.311 --> 00:39:05.679
All right.

693
00:39:05.812 --> 00:39:08.615
<i>Arriba, abajo,
al centro y pa' dentro.</i>

694
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.388
Hey, kid, slow down.

695
00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:17.424
That's a vintage rioja,
all right?

696
00:39:17.556 --> 00:39:20.627
You might want to just
taste it, savor it.

697
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.064
Or chug it down
like you're on spring break.

698
00:39:24.197 --> 00:39:25.398
All good.

699
00:39:28.134 --> 00:39:30.103
I'm onto you, you know.

700
00:39:31.938 --> 00:39:33.340
Sully.

701
00:39:34.473 --> 00:39:35.942
What?

702
00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:38.278
He's Sam's brother, isn't he?

703
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:40.847
Oh, wow, you cracked the case.
Great job.

704
00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:42.481
Does he know what happened?

705
00:39:42.615 --> 00:39:43.616
Not yet.

706
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.218
I-I'm gonna tell him.

707
00:39:45.352 --> 00:39:47.153
When?

708
00:39:47.287 --> 00:39:48.855
Who's still thirsty?

709
00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:50.457
I found another bottle of red.

710
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:52.826
Hey, kid, you think she's okay?

711
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.862
- Who?
- My cat.

712
00:39:55.996 --> 00:39:57.364
You have a cat?

713
00:39:57.496 --> 00:39:59.275
The man from the app said
he was gonna feed her,

714
00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:00.800
but he didn't text me back yet.

715
00:40:00.934 --> 00:40:02.802
I don't know what's cuter...
your concern

716
00:40:02.936 --> 00:40:05.071
or the fact that you just said
"the man from the app."

717
00:40:05.205 --> 00:40:07.040
Stop.

718
00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:21.321
Do you come here to
ruin the one place I find peace?

719
00:40:22.422 --> 00:40:23.690
Father,

720
00:40:24.924 --> 00:40:26.693
you can't give it away.

721
00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:30.230
Tell me it's not too late.

722
00:40:30.363 --> 00:40:32.899
You can't change my mind.

723
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.369
I'm making the arrangements.

724
00:40:38.304 --> 00:40:41.241
This scavenger hunt is over.

725
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.348
<i>Padre.</i>

726
00:40:49.716 --> 00:40:52.252
Do you really
have no faith in me?

727
00:40:54.387 --> 00:40:56.723
In Him I have faith.

728
00:41:12.505 --> 00:41:13.807
Who the hell are you?

729
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.974
Get out of my car!

730
00:41:17.844 --> 00:41:19.779
Santiago, what are you doing?

731
00:41:22.916 --> 00:41:23.916
Forgive me,

732
00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:25.218
Father.

733
00:41:38.198 --> 00:41:39.632
Oh, great.

734
00:41:41.468 --> 00:41:43.937
Nuns. Why's it always
got to be nuns?

735
00:41:45.872 --> 00:41:47.740
All right, let's just split up
and figure out

736
00:41:47.874 --> 00:41:49.142
where the keys go, huh?

737
00:41:49.275 --> 00:41:50.610
Okay.

738
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.979
<i>Never
thought I'd be back in church,</i>

739
00:42:26.112 --> 00:42:27.647
<i>but this one's special.</i>

740
00:42:29.149 --> 00:42:30.316
Hey, Sully.

741
00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.118
What?

742
00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:35.188
Nothing.

743
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.035
Hey, guys.

744
00:42:49.169 --> 00:42:50.370
Come here.

745
00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:54.007
Look.

746
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.209
"JSE."

747
00:42:56.342 --> 00:42:57.377
Juan Sebastián Elcano.

748
00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.213
The 18 were here all right.

749
00:43:00.346 --> 00:43:02.949
Look, if that's the cathedral,

750
00:43:03.082 --> 00:43:05.685
then these must be the stairs,

751
00:43:05.818 --> 00:43:07.854
and they lead...

752
00:43:07.987 --> 00:43:09.522
that way.

753
00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:30.009
Thoughts, altar boy?

754
00:43:32.613 --> 00:43:37.550
<i>"Caelum."</i> That's,
um, Latin for "heaven."

755
00:43:37.685 --> 00:43:39.620
Says in the journal,
"Trust in your fellow man,

756
00:43:39.752 --> 00:43:42.088
for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

757
00:43:42.222 --> 00:43:44.557
So, if heaven's up there,

758
00:43:44.692 --> 00:43:47.026
then hell has to be
around here somewhere.

759
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.561
I hope.

760
00:43:56.502 --> 00:43:58.706
Hey, I got a skeleton
with angel wings.

761
00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:01.074
That's kind of between
heaven and hell, right?

762
00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:08.548
Does Mary look
a little off to you?

763
00:44:09.849 --> 00:44:11.084
Yeah.

764
00:44:11.217 --> 00:44:12.752
No way.

765
00:44:14.787 --> 00:44:17.090
Hey. Come on, open it up.

766
00:44:17.223 --> 00:44:19.092
I'm not gonna do that.
We're in a church, man.

767
00:44:19.225 --> 00:44:20.493
Come on, have some respect.

768
00:44:20.628 --> 00:44:22.295
Scared of a little old nun?

769
00:44:22.428 --> 00:44:24.063
Well, you haven't met
Sister B, have you?

770
00:44:24.197 --> 00:44:26.799
Hold that.

771
00:44:26.933 --> 00:44:28.268
Here.

772
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.945
Okay.

773
00:44:44.117 --> 00:44:45.251
Well, there's hell.

774
00:44:45.385 --> 00:44:46.687
Whoa!

775
00:44:46.819 --> 00:44:48.756
Holy shit. You found 'em.

776
00:44:50.056 --> 00:44:51.524
Hey, what does that
look like to you?

777
00:44:51.659 --> 00:44:52.760
A keyhole.

778
00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:04.246
Wait, which way should we turn,
left or right?

779
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:06.272
I don't know.
Uh, what does the book say?

780
00:45:08.274 --> 00:45:10.343
Um... oh, right here.

781
00:45:10.476 --> 00:45:11.745
Both-both of you, uh,

782
00:45:11.878 --> 00:45:15.114
turn your keys clockwise
at the same time.

783
00:45:15.248 --> 00:45:18.484
Three, two, one.

784
00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:19.952
Turn.

785
00:45:21.254 --> 00:45:22.690
Shit!

786
00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:27.695
Thanks a lot.
You almost got me killed.

787
00:45:27.827 --> 00:45:29.128
Clockwise, Sully?

788
00:45:29.262 --> 00:45:31.164
Well, it was 50-50,
so I made a guess.

789
00:45:31.297 --> 00:45:33.333
A guess?
That could've been our heads!

790
00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:35.110
Well, clearly, you should turn
the keys the other way.

791
00:45:35.134 --> 00:45:36.245
Kid, I don't even
have my glasses.

792
00:45:36.269 --> 00:45:37.303
I can't read this shit.

793
00:45:37.437 --> 00:45:38.504
Yeah, clearly.

794
00:45:38.639 --> 00:45:40.006
Just be careful, all right?

795
00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:41.216
You're gonna get
somebody killed.

796
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.108
Okay, come on.

797
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:43.109
Counterclockwise.

798
00:45:43.242 --> 00:45:44.344
Just look away from it.

799
00:45:45.845 --> 00:45:47.847
Ready? Here we go.

800
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.248
Three, two, one.

801
00:45:49.382 --> 00:45:50.917
Turn.

802
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.418
Whoa!

803
00:45:54.887 --> 00:45:57.457
Look at that. I was right
the second time, huh?

804
00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.026
Like, an opening back here.

805
00:46:00.159 --> 00:46:01.829
You want to help, Sully?

806
00:46:01.961 --> 00:46:03.201
Oh, kid, I'm watching our back.

807
00:46:03.262 --> 00:46:05.531
What if the nun comes down
to get you?

808
00:46:05.666 --> 00:46:07.467
Chloe?

809
00:46:07.601 --> 00:46:09.535
There you go.

810
00:46:12.171 --> 00:46:14.173
All right,
we're making some progress.

811
00:46:14.307 --> 00:46:15.307
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

812
00:46:15.408 --> 00:46:17.443
Hang on. What does the book say?

813
00:46:17.577 --> 00:46:20.213
Uh, heaven and hell. One of us
goes up, the other goes down.

814
00:46:20.346 --> 00:46:22.224
- Exactly. I'll go down.
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

815
00:46:22.248 --> 00:46:23.583
- Really?
- What?

816
00:46:23.717 --> 00:46:25.461
- Well, that was quick.
- What are you talking about?

817
00:46:25.485 --> 00:46:26.687
What, are you just gonna

818
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.963
follow her down there
like a puppy dog?

819
00:46:27.987 --> 00:46:29.198
What, you want me
to come with you,

820
00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:30.466
- hold your hand?
- You know what?

821
00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:31.792
It's fine. Give me your cross.

822
00:46:31.924 --> 00:46:33.202
Not giving you my cross.
Why would I do that?

823
00:46:33.226 --> 00:46:34.870
'Cause I'm probably gonna
need it up there.

824
00:46:34.894 --> 00:46:36.438
You have your girlfriend's
cross, don't you?

825
00:46:36.462 --> 00:46:38.665
You don't need 'em both.

826
00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:40.500
Okay, good point.
Well, give me your phone.

827
00:46:40.634 --> 00:46:42.144
- No.
- Sully, just give me your phone.

828
00:46:42.168 --> 00:46:43.512
- For what?
- What, you don't trust me?

829
00:46:43.536 --> 00:46:44.605
I don't trust anybody.

830
00:46:44.738 --> 00:46:45.881
I thought
I told you that already.

831
00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:47.140
Thank you.

832
00:46:47.273 --> 00:46:49.208
I thought you knew better.

833
00:46:49.342 --> 00:46:50.476
Oh, my God.

834
00:46:50.611 --> 00:46:51.812
You have so many apps open.

835
00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:53.279
What is wrong with you?

836
00:46:54.782 --> 00:46:56.149
Tinder?

837
00:46:56.282 --> 00:46:59.085
- Really?
- I-I own that.

838
00:46:59.218 --> 00:47:02.021
Okay. Now you can track us.

839
00:47:02.155 --> 00:47:04.957
Try and stay on top of us, okay?

840
00:47:05.091 --> 00:47:07.193
- There you go.
- Have fun in the haunted tunnel.

841
00:47:07.326 --> 00:47:08.428
- Yeah.
- Enjoy.

842
00:47:08.561 --> 00:47:10.430
Oh, we will.

843
00:47:17.905 --> 00:47:19.606
<i>This is amazing.</i>

844
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.308
<i>I mean, we're the first ones
down here in 500 years.</i>

845
00:47:26.078 --> 00:47:27.580
Find the other two.

846
00:47:27.714 --> 00:47:29.248
I've got Sully.

847
00:47:29.382 --> 00:47:30.784
Aye.

848
00:47:46.232 --> 00:47:47.967
Hey, I got an arrow
pointing this way.

849
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.535
The Eye of Providence.

850
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.204
I say we go with God.

851
00:47:51.337 --> 00:47:53.377
But there's literally an arrow
that points this way.

852
00:47:53.506 --> 00:47:55.341
Suit yourself.

853
00:47:55.475 --> 00:47:57.778
But the arrow.

854
00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:59.512
I'm gonna go this way.

855
00:48:02.683 --> 00:48:05.151
Yeah, we should go your way.
We should go your way.

856
00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:11.825
Um...

857
00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:14.828
Ah, great. Here we go again.

858
00:48:14.962 --> 00:48:17.096
Do you want to work your magic?

859
00:48:19.232 --> 00:48:23.069
So, uh, when did you decide
to become Indiana Jones?

860
00:48:24.605 --> 00:48:27.173
When I was a kid,
I liked to go exploring.

861
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:32.345
One day, I found
a bronze statue covered in gems

862
00:48:32.478 --> 00:48:34.514
buried under a bridge.

863
00:48:34.648 --> 00:48:37.149
I'll never forget the feeling,
you know?

864
00:48:37.283 --> 00:48:39.185
I ran and showed it
to my father.

865
00:48:39.318 --> 00:48:42.723
I thought he'd put it
in a museum.

866
00:48:42.856 --> 00:48:44.557
But instead, he sold it.

867
00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:47.393
He kept all the money.

868
00:48:47.527 --> 00:48:49.295
We never saw him again.

869
00:48:50.697 --> 00:48:52.198
Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry.

870
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:54.902
Why? I'm better for it.

871
00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:58.872
Here. I got just the tool.

872
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:02.508
You see that?

873
00:49:02.643 --> 00:49:05.077
Sure, when the big bad nun's
not around.

874
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.552
Does this look right to you?

875
00:49:12.686 --> 00:49:14.554
Well, I don't really know
what the path

876
00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:16.990
to ancient treasure's
supposed to look like.

877
00:49:17.156 --> 00:49:19.325
- More ancient?
- I guess.

878
00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:22.094
Hey, Sully, do you see
anything weird up there?

879
00:49:22.228 --> 00:49:24.765
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

880
00:49:31.004 --> 00:49:32.438
Do you hear that?

881
00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:40.212
What the hell?

882
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:50.256
<i>Hey, what's going on down there?</i>

883
00:49:51.925 --> 00:49:54.260
Hey, this can't be right,
can it?

884
00:49:54.393 --> 00:49:56.429
<i>I can't hear one
thing you're saying.</i>

885
00:49:56.562 --> 00:49:57.998
Come on, let's go.

886
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.730
Yeah, this definitely
doesn't look right.

887
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.969
Look, above the bar.

888
00:50:02.101 --> 00:50:04.236
<i>"Infernum."</i>
Isn't that Latin for "hell"?

889
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:05.739
Yeah, it is. Come on.

890
00:50:07.239 --> 00:50:08.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

891
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:10.376
- It's Braddock's backup.
- What?

892
00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:12.244
We better keep moving.

893
00:50:13.579 --> 00:50:16.115
- What are you doing?
- Blending in.

894
00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:17.818
Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

895
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:21.287
Hey, listen, I'm not really
much of a dancer.

896
00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:24.791
- Let's go.
- Okay.

897
00:50:39.338 --> 00:50:41.240
Hey, two Commonwealths.

898
00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:42.676
Okay.

899
00:50:45.211 --> 00:50:47.446
What are you doing?

900
00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.082
I'm causing a distraction.

901
00:50:50.951 --> 00:50:52.318
Oh, for God's sake.

902
00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.162
Do you think
it's another puzzle?

903
00:51:05.098 --> 00:51:07.533
Well, whatever it is,
you better figure it out fast.

904
00:51:07.668 --> 00:51:09.970
I'm-a try and buy us some time.

905
00:51:10.103 --> 00:51:13.106
- Hey, can I get you a drink?
- Gin and tonic, <i>por favor.</i>

906
00:51:13.239 --> 00:51:14.808
This definitely
isn't a gin and tonic,

907
00:51:14.941 --> 00:51:15.809
but it is on the house.

908
00:51:15.942 --> 00:51:17.176
<i>Gracias.</i>

909
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:19.545
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me guess.

910
00:51:20.681 --> 00:51:22.816
Piña colada?

911
00:51:28.454 --> 00:51:31.590
The Eye.

912
00:51:31.725 --> 00:51:33.727
You think you're a comedian,
do you, sunshine?

913
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.895
Okay, I got it, I got it.

914
00:51:35.028 --> 00:51:36.529
Sex on the Beach.

915
00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:46.707
Nate!

916
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.909
Oh, shit.

917
00:51:49.042 --> 00:51:51.410
Nate, this is not a time
for shots. Let's go!

918
00:51:57.984 --> 00:51:59.920
God, those guys suck.

919
00:52:01.253 --> 00:52:03.090
Where the hell are we?

920
00:52:07.526 --> 00:52:09.096
Well, well, well.

921
00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:16.670
Look for a way out.

922
00:52:18.038 --> 00:52:19.940
Think I found one.

923
00:52:33.285 --> 00:52:34.587
Uh, almost caught up.

924
00:52:37.256 --> 00:52:38.557
Hey, you got that key?

925
00:52:38.692 --> 00:52:39.926
Yeah.

926
00:52:58.178 --> 00:52:59.946
- Water.
- A lot of water.

927
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:03.582
Oh, my God.

928
00:53:03.717 --> 00:53:05.952
Um, this has to be a test.

929
00:53:06.086 --> 00:53:07.462
The 18 must have built
an escape, right?

930
00:53:07.486 --> 00:53:08.726
What did the journal say again?

931
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:10.489
Uh, it said,
"Trust in your fellow man,

932
00:53:10.624 --> 00:53:12.367
for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

933
00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:13.871
"Trust in your fellow man,
for one..."

934
00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.528
- Sully!
- Sully! Uh, Sully!

935
00:53:15.662 --> 00:53:16.963
There has to be another keyhole

936
00:53:17.097 --> 00:53:18.657
up there somewhere
that opens this door!

937
00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:24.004
I'm, like, literally
in a Papa Johns right now.

938
00:53:24.137 --> 00:53:26.173
<i>Sully,
we're running out of time!</i>

939
00:53:26.305 --> 00:53:27.841
I found it.

940
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:31.278
Excuse me, guys.

941
00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:34.480
I'm gonna need a minute.

942
00:53:34.614 --> 00:53:37.550
<i>Sully, we do not have a minute!</i>

943
00:53:44.624 --> 00:53:46.827
Hand it over, Victor.

944
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.460
Oh, shit!

945
00:53:48.594 --> 00:53:49.763
Give me the cross.

946
00:53:49.896 --> 00:53:51.530
Come on, Jo.

947
00:53:51.665 --> 00:53:53.133
You know I can't do that.

948
00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:56.136
You haven't said "please."

949
00:53:56.269 --> 00:53:57.336
Now.

950
00:53:57.469 --> 00:53:59.139
Okay.

951
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.882
Didn't I tell you
you should've said "please"?

952
00:54:09.015 --> 00:54:12.418
Oh, come on, Sully.
After all we've been through?

953
00:54:15.554 --> 00:54:17.423
Sully! Hurry!

954
00:54:17.556 --> 00:54:19.326
Shut up. I'm working on it.

955
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:21.061
<i>I'll shut up when you get us</i>

956
00:54:21.194 --> 00:54:22.561
<i>the hell out of here.</i>

957
00:54:22.696 --> 00:54:25.131
Oh, sh...

958
00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:27.366
<i>What's going on?!</i>

959
00:54:27.499 --> 00:54:29.636
Sully,
if you don't turn that damn key,

960
00:54:29.769 --> 00:54:31.171
we're gonna drown.

961
00:54:31.304 --> 00:54:33.539
It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought, kid.

962
00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:39.279
You got to help me.

963
00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:40.823
Gonna try to get
this grate up, okay?

964
00:54:40.847 --> 00:54:41.882
Okay.

965
00:54:52.524 --> 00:54:55.527
I can't believe you walked out
on me, you son of a bitch.

966
00:54:55.662 --> 00:54:57.596
Why? Did you miss me?

967
00:55:02.636 --> 00:55:04.604
Sully! It's now or never, buddy!

968
00:55:04.738 --> 00:55:06.258
We're running out
of options down here!

969
00:55:06.339 --> 00:55:08.275
Nate, look at me.

970
00:55:08.407 --> 00:55:09.876
- We can do this.
- Okay.

971
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.577
- We can do this.
- Deep breaths.

972
00:55:25.292 --> 00:55:27.928
Did you miss this, Victor? Hmm?

973
00:55:56.455 --> 00:55:58.124
Chloe!

974
00:56:12.172 --> 00:56:13.472
Chloe.

975
00:56:15.308 --> 00:56:17.177
Chloe, please. Come on!

976
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.183
Okay.

977
00:56:23.316 --> 00:56:24.617
It's okay.

978
00:56:24.751 --> 00:56:26.485
Here, I'm gonna lift you out.

979
00:56:29.823 --> 00:56:31.324
Hey, guys. Say something.

980
00:56:31.458 --> 00:56:32.959
Tell me you're alive.

981
00:56:33.093 --> 00:56:34.327
<i>Yeah, we're good.</i>

982
00:56:34.461 --> 00:56:36.830
We're still alive.

983
00:56:36.963 --> 00:56:39.163
All right, then what are you
waiting for? Get a move on.

984
00:56:42.435 --> 00:56:43.303
Thank you.

985
00:56:43.436 --> 00:56:45.005
You had it.

986
00:56:45.138 --> 00:56:47.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

987
00:57:11.131 --> 00:57:13.700
- You good?
- Yeah.

988
00:57:13.833 --> 00:57:15.502
Hey, Sully, you still up there?

989
00:57:15.635 --> 00:57:17.170
<i>I'm here. What do you got?</i>

990
00:57:17.303 --> 00:57:19.538
Not much.
It's dark as hell in here.

991
00:57:26.513 --> 00:57:29.349
I always wanted to try this.

992
00:57:29.482 --> 00:57:31.550
You need to give
that thing up already.

993
00:57:31.684 --> 00:57:33.486
Oh, come on.

994
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.388
Ha.

995
00:57:35.522 --> 00:57:36.856
See? That's all I ask.

996
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.158
Little faith.

997
00:57:46.866 --> 00:57:49.602
I see a light. Is that you?

998
00:57:49.736 --> 00:57:51.037
Yeah, that's us.

999
00:57:51.171 --> 00:57:53.239
We're in some sort of...

1000
00:57:53.373 --> 00:57:55.275
Roman antechamber.

1001
00:57:56.543 --> 00:57:57.677
Whoa.

1002
00:58:04.984 --> 00:58:06.719
Hey, you got that key?

1003
00:58:09.823 --> 00:58:11.224
Thank you.

1004
00:58:11.357 --> 00:58:12.392
Okay.

1005
00:58:16.896 --> 00:58:18.231
No, it doesn't fit.

1006
00:58:19.966 --> 00:58:21.234
Sully.

1007
00:58:22.368 --> 00:58:23.436
Okay.

1008
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:25.638
Sully, we're missing something.

1009
00:58:25.772 --> 00:58:27.540
See if you can find
anything up there.

1010
00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:29.442
I can't get the grate up.

1011
00:58:29.576 --> 00:58:31.277
Forget the grate and look.

1012
00:58:33.379 --> 00:58:34.647
I see something.

1013
00:58:37.016 --> 00:58:38.751
Looks like a ladder
or something.

1014
00:58:41.554 --> 00:58:43.990
I think I get it.

1015
00:58:44.124 --> 00:58:45.959
I think it's the two keys
put together.

1016
00:58:46.092 --> 00:58:47.460
<i>What?</i>

1017
00:58:47.594 --> 00:58:49.696
I said I think it's
the two keys put together.

1018
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:51.364
Throw your key down!

1019
00:58:51.498 --> 00:58:53.378
Hey. You two think
you're gonna double-cross me?

1020
00:58:53.433 --> 00:58:55.714
Hey, Sully, you want the stupid
key, or you want the gold?

1021
00:58:55.802 --> 00:58:57.437
Come on, this is it.
Throw it down.

1022
00:58:57.570 --> 00:58:59.139
I'm coming down there for this.

1023
00:58:59.272 --> 00:59:00.507
You hear me?

1024
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.775
You ain't gonna play me.

1025
00:59:02.909 --> 00:59:04.177
Typical Sully.

1026
00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:05.678
He'd rather
lose the gold than...

1027
00:59:11.284 --> 00:59:12.685
Thank you.

1028
00:59:20.326 --> 00:59:22.128
Does that look
like a ladder to you?

1029
00:59:22.262 --> 00:59:23.663
Yeah.

1030
00:59:34.474 --> 00:59:35.609
Okay, ready?

1031
00:59:35.742 --> 00:59:39.145
Three, two, one.

1032
00:59:43.183 --> 00:59:45.318
Did you see that?

1033
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:51.357
What are you waiting for?

1034
00:59:51.491 --> 00:59:53.493
Whoa. What the...?

1035
00:59:55.295 --> 00:59:57.363
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- We found it.

1036
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.808
<i>Is the gold there? Talk to me.</i>

1037
01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:10.843
We're in an old
Roman storehouse.

1038
01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:14.414
It's got to be
at least 2,000 years old,

1039
01:00:14.547 --> 01:00:18.384
and there are these giant urns
that are like eight feet tall.

1040
01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:20.186
<i>Are they intact?</i>

1041
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.021
Yeah, they're perfectly
preserved.

1042
01:00:22.155 --> 01:00:25.024
So, what are you waiting for?
Open them up and get the gold.

1043
01:00:28.394 --> 01:00:29.796
Give me a lift.

1044
01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:33.766
Here we go. Three, two, one. Go.

1045
01:00:37.503 --> 01:00:38.838
Okay. Are you okay?

1046
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:40.940
Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:00:41.074 --> 01:00:42.775
Okay.

1048
01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:46.379
Okay.

1049
01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:48.448
- You good?
- Yeah.

1050
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.149
You see anything?

1051
01:00:56.923 --> 01:00:59.259
Uh...

1052
01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:01.261
Chloe?

1053
01:01:01.394 --> 01:01:02.730
Salt.

1054
01:01:02.862 --> 01:01:05.531
Chloe? I think
we have a problem.

1055
01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.433
Chloe?

1056
01:01:07.567 --> 01:01:10.236
They used salt
to store food, but...

1057
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.438
I don't know why they'd put...

1058
01:01:21.948 --> 01:01:23.583
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- No.

1059
01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:26.119
It's got to be here.

1060
01:01:27.487 --> 01:01:29.690
Yeah, or why all the tricks?

1061
01:01:29.822 --> 01:01:31.157
Answer me, guys.
What do you got?

1062
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:33.426
The gold's not here.

1063
01:01:50.176 --> 01:01:51.477
Oh, my God.

1064
01:01:51.612 --> 01:01:53.513
<i>What? What is it?</i>

1065
01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.620
They never brought it back.

1066
01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:02.723
The path to the gold
starts here in Barcelona,

1067
01:02:02.855 --> 01:02:06.159
but it ends somewhere over here
in the East Indies.

1068
01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:07.493
Hey, Chloe.

1069
01:02:07.628 --> 01:02:08.762
Give it to me.

1070
01:02:10.764 --> 01:02:12.098
You're kidding, right?

1071
01:02:12.231 --> 01:02:14.601
I'm not getting screwed
on this one.

1072
01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:17.437
Pick up the map
and give it to me.

1073
01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:25.078
Nate, what's going on
down there?

1074
01:02:25.211 --> 01:02:26.879
Slowly.

1075
01:02:27.013 --> 01:02:29.248
<i>Hey, tell me what's happening.</i>

1076
01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:32.218
Sully, I got this.

1077
01:02:32.352 --> 01:02:33.829
Look, you don't
have to do this, okay?

1078
01:02:33.853 --> 01:02:35.521
Don't...

1079
01:02:35.656 --> 01:02:37.156
try anything.

1080
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.025
You can trust me.

1081
01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.362
Just put the gun down.

1082
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.569
You have no idea who
you're partnered with, do you?

1083
01:02:49.703 --> 01:02:51.672
You don't even really know
what went down.

1084
01:02:51.805 --> 01:02:53.873
Went down with what?

1085
01:02:58.812 --> 01:03:00.179
Sam.

1086
01:03:00.313 --> 01:03:01.948
Who do you think?

1087
01:03:02.081 --> 01:03:03.516
What are you talking about?

1088
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.517
Ask Sully.

1089
01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:06.754
No, no, no, no, no. No.

1090
01:03:06.886 --> 01:03:09.589
Chloe, please tell me
what happened to my brother.

1091
01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:12.024
Please.

1092
01:03:13.794 --> 01:03:16.062
You're a good guy, Nate.

1093
01:03:26.072 --> 01:03:28.374
Too good.

1094
01:03:46.392 --> 01:03:48.060
Hey, Nate.

1095
01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:49.863
Wake up.

1096
01:03:51.497 --> 01:03:53.734
Got you pretty good, huh?

1097
01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:55.401
I tried to warn you about her,

1098
01:03:55.535 --> 01:03:57.905
but you didn't want
to listen, did you?

1099
01:04:00.206 --> 01:04:02.810
What happened to my brother?

1100
01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:05.311
Stop thinking of the next lie
you're gonna tell me.

1101
01:04:08.047 --> 01:04:09.783
Where's Sam, Sully?

1102
01:04:14.954 --> 01:04:16.924
I should've told you before.

1103
01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:20.259
But your brother...

1104
01:04:20.393 --> 01:04:21.762
he's gone, kid.

1105
01:04:21.895 --> 01:04:24.430
No, he's not.
You said he ghosted you.

1106
01:04:24.564 --> 01:04:27.133
He's gone. He didn't ghost me.

1107
01:04:27.266 --> 01:04:29.368
We went down to
the captain's tomb together

1108
01:04:29.502 --> 01:04:30.938
to find the journal.

1109
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:34.207
And it was there, right where
Sam said it would be.

1110
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.342
We were on our way out,
and Braddock and her guys,

1111
01:04:36.476 --> 01:04:38.344
they cut us off.

1112
01:04:38.478 --> 01:04:40.146
They opened fire, and...

1113
01:04:40.279 --> 01:04:41.782
and Sam got shot.

1114
01:04:41.915 --> 01:04:43.617
So you just
left him there to die.

1115
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.418
I saw a way out, so I took it.

1116
01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:47.286
So you just
left him there to die.

1117
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.188
What was I supposed to do,
get shot, too?

1118
01:04:49.322 --> 01:04:50.590
Nothing I could do.

1119
01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:52.759
How could you not tell me this?

1120
01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:55.037
Well, I knew if I told you, you
never would've come with me.

1121
01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:56.529
And why is that
so important, huh?

1122
01:04:56.663 --> 01:04:59.198
The hell am I doing here
and not somebody else?

1123
01:04:59.332 --> 01:05:01.969
Your brother believed
that there was a final piece.

1124
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:03.971
All right?
A last trick the 18 played.

1125
01:05:04.103 --> 01:05:05.582
I thought maybe
he said something to you

1126
01:05:05.606 --> 01:05:07.249
or sent you something.
I mean, shit, all he ever did

1127
01:05:07.273 --> 01:05:08.818
- was talk about you.
- So that's what this is about.

1128
01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:10.376
You dragged me
all the way out here,

1129
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:12.411
let me believe that I might
see my brother again

1130
01:05:12.545 --> 01:05:14.815
because you think
that I know something?

1131
01:05:14.948 --> 01:05:16.650
Yeah.

1132
01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:18.284
Do you?

1133
01:05:19.987 --> 01:05:22.121
Did you really just ask me that?

1134
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.325
You said that money
changes people...

1135
01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:27.904
makes them greedy,
makes them selfish...

1136
01:05:27.928 --> 01:05:29.028
but you know what I think?

1137
01:05:29.161 --> 01:05:30.596
I think that's just who you are.

1138
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:33.332
I don't think there was ever
a better version of you.

1139
01:05:33.466 --> 01:05:35.334
And whatever this is...

1140
01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:37.169
now I'm done.

1141
01:05:41.307 --> 01:05:42.709
Kid.

1142
01:05:54.487 --> 01:05:55.989
Mr. Moncada.

1143
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.358
We've run into
some difficulties.

1144
01:05:59.492 --> 01:06:01.227
The gold was never here
beneath the city.

1145
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.529
Yeah, I know.

1146
01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:05.398
It's quite embarrassing, huh?

1147
01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:07.266
I believe there was a clue
left down there,

1148
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.870
and we know who has it:
A Miss Chloe Frazer.

1149
01:06:10.003 --> 01:06:11.571
My people are out
looking for her now...

1150
01:06:11.705 --> 01:06:14.540
Oh, you mean the big guy
who doesn't talk

1151
01:06:14.675 --> 01:06:16.375
and his sidekick,
the Highlander?

1152
01:06:16.509 --> 01:06:18.912
Yeah, they didn't find me.

1153
01:06:19.046 --> 01:06:22.049
Diversified investment.

1154
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:26.552
I hired Miss Frazer
the same day I hired you.

1155
01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:30.590
Of course, she will lead
the operation from here on out.

1156
01:06:54.513 --> 01:06:57.084
<i>I haven't forgotten my promise.</i>

1157
01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:02.990
<i>Remember, if something's lost,</i>

1158
01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:04.858
<i>it can be found.</i>

1159
01:07:08.662 --> 01:07:10.864
I know where she took the map.

1160
01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:13.199
Moncada.

1161
01:07:13.332 --> 01:07:15.035
Right? I mean, think about it.

1162
01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:17.212
Who else is gonna have
the resources she's gonna need?

1163
01:07:17.236 --> 01:07:18.739
And Braddock and her goon squad

1164
01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:20.607
just so happened to find us
at the church?

1165
01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:23.610
He had to have somebody
on the inside.

1166
01:07:23.744 --> 01:07:25.578
You hate me.
All right, I get it.

1167
01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:27.814
Look, I'd hate me, too.

1168
01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:31.584
But Braddock, after what
she did to your brother?

1169
01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:32.853
She shot him in cold blood.

1170
01:07:32.986 --> 01:07:34.262
All right?
We can't let her win. She...

1171
01:07:34.286 --> 01:07:35.889
Oh, Sully,
will you please just stop

1172
01:07:36.023 --> 01:07:38.224
trying to play me
for like five minutes?

1173
01:07:40.359 --> 01:07:43.295
For years, I told myself
that Sam would come back.

1174
01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:47.299
That he wasn't gone,
that he was just lost.

1175
01:07:47.433 --> 01:07:50.137
But instead,
I'm stuck here with you,

1176
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:52.338
so this is how this is gonna go.

1177
01:07:52.471 --> 01:07:54.507
I'm gonna finish
what my brother started,

1178
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:56.710
and then we go
our separate ways.

1179
01:07:56.843 --> 01:07:58.277
All right.

1180
01:07:58.411 --> 01:08:00.714
It's a deal, kid.

1181
01:08:13.126 --> 01:08:14.928
Hey.

1182
01:08:15.062 --> 01:08:16.595
Be careful when you load her.

1183
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:18.296
I don't want her
getting scratched.

1184
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:20.033
Yes, sir.

1185
01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:24.502
Nice car.

1186
01:08:24.638 --> 01:08:26.305
Yeah.

1187
01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:31.044
My father gave me this car
when I turned 18.

1188
01:08:31.178 --> 01:08:34.313
It's been my good-luck charm
ever since.

1189
01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:39.019
The map.

1190
01:08:43.857 --> 01:08:46.660
You know...

1191
01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:49.029
it's natural
to feel some conflict.

1192
01:08:50.764 --> 01:08:53.966
You made a difficult decision
but the right one.

1193
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.603
I don't really do regret.

1194
01:08:56.737 --> 01:08:58.571
Neither do I.

1195
01:08:58.705 --> 01:09:00.073
Shall we?

1196
01:09:05.845 --> 01:09:07.546
When you're right,
you're right, huh?

1197
01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.015
You don't have to
apologize to me now.

1198
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.785
She only cut us out
because she knew

1199
01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:13.519
you were gonna cut her out.

1200
01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:15.087
You're still harboring feelings

1201
01:09:15.221 --> 01:09:17.256
for that girl who knocked you
on your ass, huh?

1202
01:09:17.389 --> 01:09:18.759
Wow.

1203
01:09:20.459 --> 01:09:22.863
Let's go!
Move it in, lock it down!

1204
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.564
All right, come on.

1205
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.466
They're getting ready to go.

1206
01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:32.470
<i>Maravilloso.</i>

1207
01:09:32.606 --> 01:09:35.541
Now, who is ready to make
a little history?

1208
01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:44.785
I overlaid the map
with modern satellite imagery.

1209
01:09:44.917 --> 01:09:47.520
We'll drop our supplies
from the air,

1210
01:09:47.654 --> 01:09:49.022
land in Kiamba, Philippines,

1211
01:09:49.156 --> 01:09:50.991
where we'll be met
by our local forces.

1212
01:09:52.926 --> 01:09:57.296
We should find the pot
at the end of the rainbow here,

1213
01:09:57.429 --> 01:09:58.665
in Cala de Oro.

1214
01:10:03.904 --> 01:10:05.205
<i>Vámonos.</i>

1215
01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:24.590
<i>Approaching drop zone.</i>

1216
01:10:24.724 --> 01:10:26.525
<i>Lowering cargo door.</i>

1217
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.430
To the Victor...

1218
01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:33.532
the spoils.

1219
01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.506
Ah, come on. Give it to them.

1220
01:10:43.509 --> 01:10:47.180
500 years ago,
my family was betrayed.

1221
01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.851
Yes, a small band of explorers,

1222
01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:53.653
they found
the world biggest fortune.

1223
01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:55.655
And you know what? They hid it.

1224
01:10:55.789 --> 01:10:58.859
Uh, for centuries,
people search for it,

1225
01:10:58.992 --> 01:11:01.194
all in vain.

1226
01:11:01.328 --> 01:11:03.864
It was left to me

1227
01:11:03.997 --> 01:11:06.266
to recover my family's gold.

1228
01:11:07.466 --> 01:11:09.169
Nobody thought I could do it.

1229
01:11:09.302 --> 01:11:13.039
And certainly not my...
my father.

1230
01:11:17.677 --> 01:11:20.680
Now, today...

1231
01:11:20.814 --> 01:11:26.086
is the day I restore
the Moncadas' fortune.

1232
01:11:26.219 --> 01:11:30.323
And I bring honor
back to my house.

1233
01:11:30.456 --> 01:11:33.193
And I earn my place in...

1234
01:11:38.031 --> 01:11:40.867
Daddy was right...
you don't have what it takes.

1235
01:11:41.001 --> 01:11:44.037
The House of Moncada
dies with you.

1236
01:11:54.446 --> 01:11:55.949
Where's Frazer?

1237
01:11:59.719 --> 01:12:01.453
No loose ends.

1238
01:12:19.039 --> 01:12:21.074
That was literally
the worst ten hours of my life.

1239
01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:23.542
You want to get caught,
just keep talking.

1240
01:12:30.383 --> 01:12:31.785
Oh, good job, Jo.

1241
01:12:35.388 --> 01:12:36.723
Oh, shit.

1242
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:43.105
It's hard to find a good
partner in this game, huh?

1243
01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:44.407
Well, maybe you'll learn
to appreciate me

1244
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:45.799
a little bit more.

1245
01:12:45.932 --> 01:12:47.934
All right, let's find
some parachutes.

1246
01:12:49.468 --> 01:12:51.771
- Parachutes? What?
- Unless you know a better way

1247
01:12:51.905 --> 01:12:53.539
to jump out of a plane.

1248
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:06.052
It looks like
the Lassie's boosted.

1249
01:13:26.439 --> 01:13:29.109
Hey. Don't even think about it.

1250
01:13:29.242 --> 01:13:31.011
I can't just let her
get away with it.

1251
01:13:31.144 --> 01:13:33.213
This is not the place
to pick a fight, okay?

1252
01:13:33.346 --> 01:13:34.647
I'm trying to protect you.

1253
01:13:34.781 --> 01:13:36.683
Put one of these on.
Let's go now.

1254
01:13:40.854 --> 01:13:42.622
Hey!

1255
01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:44.391
Did you kill my brother?

1256
01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:52.432
I said, did you kill
my brother, Sam Drake?

1257
01:13:52.564 --> 01:13:54.167
Nate! Come on!

1258
01:14:02.308 --> 01:14:03.542
Whoa.

1259
01:14:06.146 --> 01:14:07.881
Whoa!

1260
01:14:13.086 --> 01:14:14.888
Oh, God!

1261
01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:35.208
Hey, Braddock!
We found your loose end.

1262
01:14:37.677 --> 01:14:39.946
Now get rid of her.

1263
01:14:48.188 --> 01:14:49.722
Oh, crap!

1264
01:14:55.962 --> 01:14:57.964
We can patch this up, Frazer.

1265
01:14:58.098 --> 01:14:59.598
Drop the gun.

1266
01:15:27.427 --> 01:15:29.229
I don't think
you've been counting.

1267
01:15:29.362 --> 01:15:32.232
You've only got one shot left.

1268
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:37.937
I got to give it to you, Frazer.

1269
01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:39.973
A fighter to the bitter end.

1270
01:15:40.106 --> 01:15:42.275
This is a very bad idea.

1271
01:15:42.408 --> 01:15:43.810
But this is the end.

1272
01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:53.621
Whoa!

1273
01:16:01.995 --> 01:16:03.363
- Nate?
- Oh, come on!

1274
01:16:18.778 --> 01:16:20.079
What the hell are you doing?!

1275
01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:22.148
You just hit me with a car!

1276
01:16:22.282 --> 01:16:25.852
- You don't have a parachute?
- You don't have a parachute!

1277
01:16:25.985 --> 01:16:27.887
- Follow me!
- What?

1278
01:16:31.024 --> 01:16:32.992
Come on.

1279
01:16:38.198 --> 01:16:39.966
Whoa! Oh, shit!

1280
01:16:57.383 --> 01:16:59.185
Pull the cord!

1281
01:17:01.221 --> 01:17:02.855
Nate, come on!

1282
01:17:02.989 --> 01:17:04.757
I'm trying!

1283
01:17:17.605 --> 01:17:19.405
Hold on. Hold on!

1284
01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:38.591
I'm not gonna apologize,

1285
01:17:38.726 --> 01:17:40.260
if that's what
you're waiting for.

1286
01:17:40.393 --> 01:17:41.928
I could probably forgive you

1287
01:17:42.061 --> 01:17:44.364
for what you did in Barcelona.

1288
01:17:44.497 --> 01:17:48.101
Maybe even for knocking me
out of a plane with a car.

1289
01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:49.535
But Braddock? Really?

1290
01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:51.537
You really think
there's any difference

1291
01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:52.972
between them and you?

1292
01:17:53.106 --> 01:17:54.474
You and Sully were just as eager

1293
01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:56.075
to screw me over as they were.

1294
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:58.444
Look, I'm not Sully, okay?

1295
01:17:58.578 --> 01:18:00.013
Hallelujah.

1296
01:18:00.146 --> 01:18:01.514
One's bad enough.

1297
01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:10.490
Nate?

1298
01:18:11.759 --> 01:18:13.926
Do you see what I'm seeing?

1299
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.297
Well, if what you're seeing is
endless open ocean, then yeah.

1300
01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:26.172
Holy shit.

1301
01:18:38.151 --> 01:18:41.655
Whoa.
What the hell happened to you two?

1302
01:18:41.789 --> 01:18:44.590
Fell out of a car
that fell out of a plane.

1303
01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:47.593
Huh. Hey, you know, something
like that happened to me once.

1304
01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:51.264
Ah. Okay.

1305
01:18:54.735 --> 01:18:56.169
Good luck.

1306
01:18:56.302 --> 01:18:58.838
And here is your card back,
Mr. Sullivan.

1307
01:18:58.971 --> 01:19:01.474
Please, call me Victor.

1308
01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:03.448
Come on, I spent ten hours
in a trunk with him.

1309
01:19:03.509 --> 01:19:04.544
I couldn't help myself.

1310
01:19:04.678 --> 01:19:06.145
Let me show you to your room.

1311
01:19:06.279 --> 01:19:07.681
Thank you.

1312
01:19:12.285 --> 01:19:15.054
Moncada's money has
bought us everything we need.

1313
01:19:16.489 --> 01:19:18.191
All right, let's get to work.

1314
01:19:32.205 --> 01:19:33.707
Hey there.

1315
01:19:34.974 --> 01:19:37.076
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1316
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:41.514
Are you sure these dimensions
are the same as the actual map?

1317
01:19:41.648 --> 01:19:44.651
To the exact millimeter. Why?

1318
01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:48.254
Braddock isn't gonna
find the gold.

1319
01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:51.057
Well, not where
she's looking, anyway.

1320
01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:53.159
You mean we still have a chance?

1321
01:19:53.292 --> 01:19:55.094
The captain left one final clue,

1322
01:19:55.228 --> 01:19:58.030
and Sully seems to think that
Sam knew what that clue was,

1323
01:19:58.164 --> 01:20:01.100
and he might have tried
to tell me what it was.

1324
01:20:01.234 --> 01:20:02.703
These postcards
are the only thing

1325
01:20:02.836 --> 01:20:04.570
I've got from Sam
in the last ten years,

1326
01:20:04.705 --> 01:20:07.140
so if he did try
to tell me something, it...

1327
01:20:07.273 --> 01:20:09.475
has to be in these cards.

1328
01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:11.144
For the love of God,
please be trying

1329
01:20:11.277 --> 01:20:12.813
to tell me something, Sam.

1330
01:20:12.945 --> 01:20:15.148
Is it something in the images?

1331
01:20:15.281 --> 01:20:17.116
Or something in the writing.

1332
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.086
Like an anagram or a cipher.

1333
01:20:20.219 --> 01:20:22.288
We used to do that
all the time as kids.

1334
01:20:22.422 --> 01:20:23.824
Well, let's start
with the images.

1335
01:20:23.956 --> 01:20:25.491
- Do blue.
- Colors.

1336
01:20:25.626 --> 01:20:26.902
- There's a lot of blue.
- Okay, okay.

1337
01:20:26.926 --> 01:20:29.061
Um... There's one card

1338
01:20:29.195 --> 01:20:31.464
where he spells
everything wrong.

1339
01:20:31.597 --> 01:20:33.065
- Weird.
- Where is that?

1340
01:20:33.199 --> 01:20:35.101
- T-H-A-R...
- Um...

1341
01:20:35.234 --> 01:20:36.804
- Hills.
- H-Hills?

1342
01:20:36.936 --> 01:20:37.970
Hills.

1343
01:20:38.104 --> 01:20:41.040
So try writing, uh, this out.

1344
01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:43.252
- "Wish you were here, bro."
- "Wish you were here..."

1345
01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:45.111
<i>And then for every
letter you write down,</i>

1346
01:20:45.244 --> 01:20:46.946
<i>find the corresponding letter.</i>

1347
01:20:47.079 --> 01:20:50.082
<i>So, "Wish you were here, bro."</i>

1348
01:20:50.216 --> 01:20:51.919
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1349
01:20:57.023 --> 01:20:58.591
Come on, Sam.

1350
01:20:58.725 --> 01:21:00.761
What are you trying to tell me?

1351
01:21:11.571 --> 01:21:13.874
What are you trying
to tell me, buddy?

1352
01:21:14.006 --> 01:21:16.509
"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will."

1353
01:21:16.643 --> 01:21:19.378
"There's a whole world
you haven't seen..."

1354
01:21:24.484 --> 01:21:26.887
"Haven't seen."

1355
01:21:35.461 --> 01:21:38.765
Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

1356
01:21:38.899 --> 01:21:41.668
"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will.

1357
01:21:41.802 --> 01:21:43.704
Promise. Sam."

1358
01:21:55.949 --> 01:21:58.126
"The keys are your compass."
"The keys are your compass."

1359
01:21:58.150 --> 01:21:59.552
"The key..."

1360
01:22:06.192 --> 01:22:07.928
Okay, okay, okay.

1361
01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:11.932
Some compass, my ass.

1362
01:22:24.678 --> 01:22:27.046
Holy shit.

1363
01:22:27.179 --> 01:22:29.950
Blue goes there.

1364
01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:34.021
And red goes there.

1365
01:22:44.564 --> 01:22:45.766
Oh, my God.

1366
01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:53.406
Oh, my God. Chloe.

1367
01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.251
Okay.

1368
01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:32.178
- Get out.
- Okay. Jump.

1369
01:23:34.213 --> 01:23:35.481
- Let's go.
- Not bad.

1370
01:23:37.116 --> 01:23:38.184
Very good.

1371
01:24:07.948 --> 01:24:09.482
Chloe?

1372
01:24:14.286 --> 01:24:15.889
<i>I'm sorry, Nate.</i>

1373
01:24:16.023 --> 01:24:18.157
<i>I like you. I really do.</i>

1374
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:19.893
<i>But I learned the hard way</i>

1375
01:24:20.027 --> 01:24:23.362
<i>the minute you start
to trust someone, you lose.</i>

1376
01:24:25.699 --> 01:24:27.400
Yeah, well...

1377
01:24:27.533 --> 01:24:30.469
too bad you're headed
in the wrong direction.

1378
01:24:41.848 --> 01:24:44.151
What the hell?

1379
01:26:36.428 --> 01:26:39.331
<i>Lost. Not gone.</i>

1380
01:26:39.465 --> 01:26:41.668
<i>There's a difference.</i>

1381
01:26:41.802 --> 01:26:44.271
<i>If something's lost,</i>

1382
01:26:44.403 --> 01:26:46.206
<i>it can be found.</i>

1383
01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:51.845
We did it, Sam.

1384
01:26:55.916 --> 01:26:57.349
We did it.

1385
01:27:50.003 --> 01:27:52.038
Cloves.

1386
01:27:52.172 --> 01:27:54.040
You know, back then,
spices were worth

1387
01:27:54.174 --> 01:27:55.876
nearly as much as gold.

1388
01:27:58.011 --> 01:27:59.312
Why am I not surprised?

1389
01:27:59.445 --> 01:28:02.315
I keep too many apps open,
remember?

1390
01:28:02.448 --> 01:28:04.718
- I knew you'd figure it out.
- Figure what out?

1391
01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:07.187
The puzzle in Sam's postcards.

1392
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.722
- So, what is it?
- Does it matter?

1393
01:28:08.855 --> 01:28:10.023
I already found the gold.

1394
01:28:10.156 --> 01:28:11.156
I don't see any gold.

1395
01:28:11.224 --> 01:28:12.558
Oh, it's here.

1396
01:28:12.692 --> 01:28:13.894
It's a false top.

1397
01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:16.696
Old pirate trick.

1398
01:28:18.064 --> 01:28:20.100
Here's your gold
you've been looking for.

1399
01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.969
You happy now?

1400
01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.574
Holy shit.

1401
01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:30.210
You got to be kidding me.

1402
01:28:32.444 --> 01:28:34.948
Well, look at that, huh?

1403
01:28:35.081 --> 01:28:37.717
It's almost more than we
thought. Plus the other ship.

1404
01:28:37.851 --> 01:28:39.195
Plus the value
of the ships themselves,

1405
01:28:39.219 --> 01:28:40.720
which you can't even
put a price on.

1406
01:28:40.854 --> 01:28:42.289
We did it! We actually did it!

1407
01:28:42.421 --> 01:28:45.091
Sully, we didn't do anything.

1408
01:28:45.225 --> 01:28:48.929
Okay? There is no "we."
There's only you.

1409
01:28:49.062 --> 01:28:50.664
Because there's not
a person in your life

1410
01:28:50.797 --> 01:28:52.598
that you wouldn't betray
for a piece of this.

1411
01:28:52.732 --> 01:28:54.868
You made that real clear.

1412
01:28:55.001 --> 01:28:56.281
I thought that's what we wanted.

1413
01:28:56.403 --> 01:28:58.605
No, I wanted to do this
with my brother Sam,

1414
01:28:58.738 --> 01:28:59.973
not with you.

1415
01:29:02.508 --> 01:29:04.476
I know.

1416
01:29:04.611 --> 01:29:06.746
I'm sorry.

1417
01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.049
But look around, kid.
You did this.

1418
01:29:10.617 --> 01:29:12.819
He'd be proud of you.

1419
01:29:25.932 --> 01:29:27.767
- It's Braddock.
- Shit.

1420
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:29.169
We'd better get small.

1421
01:29:29.302 --> 01:29:31.037
- Or, in your case, smaller.
- Hey.

1422
01:29:31.171 --> 01:29:34.007
You're only like one inch
taller than me, Max.

1423
01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.875
I think it's a little more
than that, kid.

1424
01:29:36.009 --> 01:29:37.677
Come with me.
I know where to go.

1425
01:29:41.513 --> 01:29:43.482
Magellan's ships.

1426
01:29:43.616 --> 01:29:47.053
Oh, they're more beautiful than
I could have ever imagined.

1427
01:29:47.187 --> 01:29:48.822
Find the gold. If you see Sully,

1428
01:29:48.955 --> 01:29:50.657
do not let him open
that mouth of his.

1429
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:53.492
Kill him and Drake on sight.

1430
01:29:53.626 --> 01:29:55.095
- Aye.
- Be careful, gentlemen.

1431
01:29:55.228 --> 01:29:56.988
These ships are worth a fortune
on their own.

1432
01:29:57.063 --> 01:29:59.498
You put a hole in my boats,
I put a hole in you.

1433
01:30:05.138 --> 01:30:07.040
- Oh, I'm not going in there.
- Hey, look.

1434
01:30:07.173 --> 01:30:08.918
You could stay up here
and get shot in the head

1435
01:30:08.942 --> 01:30:10.653
or come down here
for a quick cuddle... up to you.

1436
01:30:10.677 --> 01:30:12.479
- I'm going down.
- Oh, God.

1437
01:30:41.174 --> 01:30:42.509
You see anything?

1438
01:30:44.177 --> 01:30:45.712
All clear, sir.

1439
01:30:49.682 --> 01:30:51.017
Braddock.

1440
01:30:52.052 --> 01:30:53.720
We cannae find them.

1441
01:30:53.853 --> 01:30:55.388
They're nae on board.

1442
01:30:55.522 --> 01:30:57.266
They must have filled
their pockets and fled.

1443
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.557
Keep an eye out anyway.

1444
01:30:58.691 --> 01:31:00.660
Sully's a cockroach
when it comes to gold.

1445
01:31:16.476 --> 01:31:18.511
<i>Wind is
one-five-zero-one-five-nine.</i>

1446
01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:20.413
<i>Hold TRQ at 4.2.</i>

1447
01:31:20.547 --> 01:31:21.915
<i>All right, who's clear?</i>

1448
01:31:27.253 --> 01:31:29.055
What is it with you
and small spaces?

1449
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:31.057
Got this
thing jamming up my ass.

1450
01:31:33.726 --> 01:31:36.129
- Wow.
- Don't even think about it.

1451
01:31:36.262 --> 01:31:37.596
Oh, I'm thinking about it.

1452
01:31:37.730 --> 01:31:39.099
Oh, my God.

1453
01:31:52.812 --> 01:31:54.647
All right, come on.

1454
01:31:56.583 --> 01:31:58.818
Oh, Jesus.
She's flying the ships out?

1455
01:31:58.952 --> 01:32:00.253
And us with them.

1456
01:32:00.386 --> 01:32:02.922
What do you mean,
she's flying us out?

1457
01:32:21.609 --> 01:32:23.309
Victoria, this is Trinidad.

1458
01:32:23.443 --> 01:32:25.512
Are you ready to receive? Over.

1459
01:32:25.645 --> 01:32:28.648
<i>Roger that.
Victoria standing by.</i>

1460
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:31.351
Let's bring her home.

1461
01:32:31.484 --> 01:32:32.986
<i>You ready up there, Scotty?</i>

1462
01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:34.554
Aye.

1463
01:32:34.687 --> 01:32:36.022
<i>Hold TRQ at 4.2.</i>

1464
01:32:36.156 --> 01:32:37.724
<i>Two degrees south.</i>

1465
01:32:41.027 --> 01:32:43.038
Geez, Sully, come on.
The boat's full of that stuff.

1466
01:32:43.062 --> 01:32:44.964
Just in case.

1467
01:32:45.098 --> 01:32:46.833
No.

1468
01:32:49.637 --> 01:32:51.738
Hey. You want to go show 'em
what's what?

1469
01:32:51.871 --> 01:32:53.415
That's nice.
Let me see it for a second.

1470
01:32:53.439 --> 01:32:55.008
- Yeah, nice, huh?
- Yeah, real nice.

1471
01:32:55.141 --> 01:32:56.743
Hey.

1472
01:33:12.492 --> 01:33:13.993
Holding steady.

1473
01:33:14.127 --> 01:33:15.562
You ready for a mutiny?

1474
01:33:15.728 --> 01:33:17.730
Why not?

1475
01:33:28.274 --> 01:33:30.076
Whoa!

1476
01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:38.785
Whoa!

1477
01:33:42.021 --> 01:33:43.089
Oh, shit.

1478
01:33:43.223 --> 01:33:44.466
That one's a little more
your size.

1479
01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:45.490
Yeah, cute.

1480
01:34:13.654 --> 01:34:15.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my gold!

1481
01:34:20.426 --> 01:34:21.729
Oh, shit.

1482
01:34:21.861 --> 01:34:24.297
Okay, you go to go hijack
that helicopter.

1483
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:27.233
Right to the point, huh?
All right.

1484
01:34:27.367 --> 01:34:29.411
You know the drill, right?
You don't have to touch it

1485
01:34:29.435 --> 01:34:31.137
with your finger to use it.

1486
01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:36.109
Hey, Sully.

1487
01:34:37.377 --> 01:34:39.445
- Don't crash.
- Just what I needed.

1488
01:34:39.579 --> 01:34:41.814
Positive reinforcement. Thanks.

1489
01:34:49.589 --> 01:34:52.158
Hey! All hands on deck!

1490
01:34:52.292 --> 01:34:54.628
Raise the anchor!
Hoist the mainsail!

1491
01:34:54.762 --> 01:34:56.996
Hey, Jack Sparrow, stay sharp.

1492
01:34:57.130 --> 01:34:58.907
Oh, come on, man,
I've been waiting to do this

1493
01:34:58.931 --> 01:35:00.099
my entire life.

1494
01:35:06.406 --> 01:35:07.406
Hey, guys.

1495
01:35:11.712 --> 01:35:12.780
Hey!

1496
01:35:24.725 --> 01:35:26.326
All right, Victor, you got this.

1497
01:35:26.459 --> 01:35:27.860
Come on.

1498
01:35:27.994 --> 01:35:29.128
Easy.

1499
01:35:34.635 --> 01:35:36.135
<i>Hey, Jo.</i>

1500
01:35:40.306 --> 01:35:41.307
Follow that ship.

1501
01:35:50.183 --> 01:35:52.985
Hey, Sully, I think your
girlfriend wants her boat back.

1502
01:35:53.119 --> 01:35:54.253
Yeah, I'm aware.

1503
01:35:54.387 --> 01:35:55.497
- Try to get the...
- Load 'em up!

1504
01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:56.521
- Go!
- Go!

1505
01:35:59.492 --> 01:36:00.828
Come on.

1506
01:36:03.731 --> 01:36:05.431
- Clear!
- Go!

1507
01:36:09.469 --> 01:36:11.537
All right,
let's see what this shitcan can do.

1508
01:36:19.512 --> 01:36:20.880
Shite!

1509
01:36:41.901 --> 01:36:43.637
Hang on, kid.
I'm-a get us out of here.

1510
01:37:07.026 --> 01:37:08.928
Okay. Okay.

1511
01:37:12.398 --> 01:37:13.734
Gunpowder.

1512
01:37:21.574 --> 01:37:23.109
Look at that.

1513
01:37:23.242 --> 01:37:24.778
There we go.

1514
01:37:24.912 --> 01:37:25.913
Come on, baby.

1515
01:37:39.058 --> 01:37:40.293
I think that did it.

1516
01:37:40.426 --> 01:37:42.295
I still got it.

1517
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.331
Oh, shit.

1518
01:38:19.766 --> 01:38:20.767
Hey, you still with me?

1519
01:38:20.901 --> 01:38:22.769
Barely.

1520
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:39.352
Yes!

1521
01:38:40.687 --> 01:38:41.788
You got to do something.

1522
01:38:41.922 --> 01:38:44.023
They're coming right at us.

1523
01:38:45.157 --> 01:38:46.425
I think I have an idea.

1524
01:38:46.559 --> 01:38:47.728
Okay.

1525
01:38:56.003 --> 01:38:57.403
What's going on?!

1526
01:38:57.537 --> 01:38:58.781
Sully, will you please
just shut up?

1527
01:38:58.805 --> 01:39:01.107
I'm working on it. Okay.

1528
01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.175
<i>That's your idea?</i>

1529
01:39:06.178 --> 01:39:07.346
No.

1530
01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.115
Ah, come on!

1531
01:39:22.796 --> 01:39:24.564
No, no, no, no.

1532
01:39:27.066 --> 01:39:28.334
No, no, no.

1533
01:39:28.467 --> 01:39:29.670
Oh, God!

1534
01:39:33.072 --> 01:39:34.173
Oh, shite!

1535
01:39:37.376 --> 01:39:38.712
What a shot!

1536
01:39:52.358 --> 01:39:53.358
Mother Mary!

1537
01:40:02.069 --> 01:40:03.269
We're home free.

1538
01:40:03.402 --> 01:40:05.137
You did it, kid. You did it.

1539
01:40:05.271 --> 01:40:06.305
Yeah, Sully!

1540
01:40:06.439 --> 01:40:08.609
If I lose, so do you.

1541
01:40:09.743 --> 01:40:11.243
Hey, Sully, this ain't over.

1542
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.988
Damn it!

1543
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.254
What's going on?

1544
01:40:28.962 --> 01:40:30.429
Come on, we're so close!

1545
01:40:35.702 --> 01:40:37.070
Ah, shit!

1546
01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.307
No, no, no!

1547
01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:45.646
No!

1548
01:40:45.779 --> 01:40:46.980
Damn!

1549
01:41:03.262 --> 01:41:04.707
Say hi to your brother
for me, will you?

1550
01:41:04.731 --> 01:41:06.066
You first.

1551
01:41:27.186 --> 01:41:28.554
Sully!

1552
01:41:31.424 --> 01:41:32.826
Sully, no!

1553
01:41:32.959 --> 01:41:34.360
Please!

1554
01:41:37.329 --> 01:41:38.564
Shit.

1555
01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:42.201
Hey, Braddock!

1556
01:41:52.145 --> 01:41:54.781
Nate! Come on!

1557
01:41:54.915 --> 01:41:56.049
Trust me.

1558
01:42:21.975 --> 01:42:24.510
I got you, kid. I got you.

1559
01:42:24.644 --> 01:42:27.013
Come on.

1560
01:42:34.587 --> 01:42:35.956
Look at her.

1561
01:42:36.089 --> 01:42:37.924
You can't put a price on that.

1562
01:42:38.058 --> 01:42:39.558
Yeah, you can, actually.

1563
01:42:39.693 --> 01:42:41.194
Like four to six billion.

1564
01:42:55.142 --> 01:42:56.610
We could just get a diving rig.

1565
01:42:58.044 --> 01:43:00.513
Not before those guys.

1566
01:43:00.647 --> 01:43:03.415
It's property
of the Philippines now.

1567
01:43:26.273 --> 01:43:27.908
Hey. I just wanted
to say thank you

1568
01:43:28.041 --> 01:43:29.776
for what you did for me
back there.

1569
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:32.279
You know, ever since
my brother Sam left...

1570
01:43:34.313 --> 01:43:36.283
Oh, you... Oh.

1571
01:43:36.415 --> 01:43:37.751
Can you hear me?

1572
01:43:38.952 --> 01:43:40.620
- I can now.
- I was...

1573
01:43:40.754 --> 01:43:42.656
I was just saying
we should get out of here.

1574
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:45.091
You got it.

1575
01:43:51.264 --> 01:43:52.264
Hey.

1576
01:43:52.331 --> 01:43:54.134
Is that who I think it is?

1577
01:43:59.139 --> 01:44:00.573
Bastards.

1578
01:44:02.341 --> 01:44:05.011
Yeah, I might have let her
steal the wrong coordinates.

1579
01:44:06.813 --> 01:44:08.514
Hey, you're starting
to figure it out, kid.

1580
01:44:08.648 --> 01:44:10.050
Yeah, I learned from the best.

1581
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:13.086
You got a heart of gold, Sully.

1582
01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.088
Real funny, wiseass.

1583
01:44:15.222 --> 01:44:17.657
- What, too soon?
- Forever is too soon.

1584
01:44:17.791 --> 01:44:19.893
Here, maybe this will help.
I got you something.

1585
01:44:25.999 --> 01:44:27.533
Are you kidding me, kid?
For real?

1586
01:44:27.667 --> 01:44:28.969
Yeah, look. I got this...

1587
01:44:30.103 --> 01:44:31.238
You got to be kidding me.

1588
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:32.570
- And these.
- You got more?

1589
01:44:32.672 --> 01:44:34.007
- I got loads of it. Look.
- Oh.

1590
01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.141
Keep it coming.

1591
01:44:35.275 --> 01:44:36.275
You'll like this one.

1592
01:44:36.309 --> 01:44:37.878
Here you go. Here you go.

1593
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.581
Aw.

1594
01:44:44.483 --> 01:44:46.219
This means a lot to me.

1595
01:44:48.387 --> 01:44:50.257
That was my last piece, man.

1596
01:44:50.389 --> 01:44:51.892
Come on, let's just
get out of here.

1597
01:44:52.025 --> 01:44:53.492
All right, hang on.

1598
01:47:53.073 --> 01:47:55.675
- You're late.
- Sorry about that.

1599
01:47:56.976 --> 01:47:58.511
Why do you want the map?

1600
01:48:00.213 --> 01:48:02.682
I'll tell you...

1601
01:48:02.816 --> 01:48:05.218
if you tell me
what Roman wants with my ring.

1602
01:48:09.856 --> 01:48:13.159
Because he knows it means
something special to you.

1603
01:48:13.293 --> 01:48:14.928
Okay, let's have it.

1604
01:48:22.869 --> 01:48:26.139
Now... you're gonna tell me
what's so important

1605
01:48:26.272 --> 01:48:28.241
about an old Nazi map.

1606
01:48:28.374 --> 01:48:30.577
Hey. Put 'em down, boys.

1607
01:48:30.710 --> 01:48:32.145
Nice and slow.

1608
01:48:32.278 --> 01:48:33.813
What...

1609
01:48:33.947 --> 01:48:35.482
What is that thing on your face?

1610
01:48:35.615 --> 01:48:36.926
Hey, puberty's
right around the corner, kid.

1611
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:38.885
You can grow your own.

1612
01:48:45.258 --> 01:48:47.427
You got what you want.

1613
01:48:48.795 --> 01:48:50.230
And I got what I want.

1614
01:48:54.968 --> 01:48:57.237
Montecristo. I'm impressed.

1615
01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:59.272
You're gonna be dead
before you can smoke it.

1616
01:48:59.405 --> 01:49:01.841
Hey, it's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

1617
01:49:01.975 --> 01:49:04.944
And, um...
would you look at that?

1618
01:49:08.681 --> 01:49:10.483
I got friends everywhere, Drake.

1619
01:49:10.618 --> 01:49:12.051
Oh, yeah?
I can't wait to meet 'em.

1620
01:49:12.185 --> 01:49:13.597
Hey, you were supposed
to be here yesterday.

1621
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:14.964
Did you know you need
special papers

1622
01:49:14.988 --> 01:49:16.322
to bring an animal on a plane?

1623
01:49:16.456 --> 01:49:18.256
- I did not know that.
- You trying to tell me

1624
01:49:18.358 --> 01:49:20.436
I almost just bought it because
you brought your damn cat?

1625
01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.029
Hey, I go everywhere with
Mr. Whiskers, okay?

1626
01:49:23.163 --> 01:49:24.964
Let me see the map.

1627
01:49:26.366 --> 01:49:27.700
This is the big one, kid.

1628
01:49:27.834 --> 01:49:28.834
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1629
01:49:28.935 --> 01:49:29.969
Let's go.

1630
01:49:32.172 --> 01:49:34.642
Oh, crap.
